Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n} is S_n. It also mentions that a_2 and a_4 are the two roots of the equation x¬≤ - x - 2 = 0. I need to find the value of S_5, which is the sum of the first five terms of this sequence. The options are A: 5/2, B: 5, C: -5/2, D: -5.First, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a common difference to the previous term. So, if the first term is a_1 and the common difference is d, then the nth term a_n can be written as a_1 + (n-1)d.Given that a_2 and a_4 are roots of the quadratic equation x¬≤ - x - 2 = 0, I can use Vieta's formulas to find the sum and product of these roots. Vieta's formulas state that for a quadratic equation ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a and the product is c/a.In this case, the equation is x¬≤ - x - 2 = 0, so a = 1, b = -1, c = -2. Therefore, the sum of the roots a_2 + a_4 = -b/a = -(-1)/1 = 1, and the product of the roots a_2 * a_4 = c/a = -2/1 = -2.So, I have that a_2 + a_4 = 1 and a_2 * a_4 = -2.Now, since this is an arithmetic sequence, the terms can be expressed as:a_2 = a_1 + da_4 = a_1 + 3dSo, substituting these into the sum equation:a_2 + a_4 = (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 3d) = 2a_1 + 4d = 1So, 2a_1 + 4d = 1. Let me write that as equation (1):2a_1 + 4d = 1Now, I also know that the product of a_2 and a_4 is -2:(a_1 + d)(a_1 + 3d) = -2Let me expand this:(a_1 + d)(a_1 + 3d) = a_1¬≤ + 3a_1d + a_1d + 3d¬≤ = a_1¬≤ + 4a_1d + 3d¬≤ = -2So, equation (2):a_1¬≤ + 4a_1d + 3d¬≤ = -2Now, I have two equations:1) 2a_1 + 4d = 12) a_1¬≤ + 4a_1d + 3d¬≤ = -2I need to solve these two equations to find a_1 and d.From equation (1), I can solve for a_1 in terms of d:2a_1 + 4d = 1Divide both sides by 2:a_1 + 2d = 0.5So, a_1 = 0.5 - 2dNow, substitute this expression for a_1 into equation (2):(0.5 - 2d)¬≤ + 4*(0.5 - 2d)*d + 3d¬≤ = -2Let me compute each term step by step.First, compute (0.5 - 2d)¬≤:= (0.5)¬≤ - 2*0.5*2d + (2d)¬≤= 0.25 - 2d + 4d¬≤Next, compute 4*(0.5 - 2d)*d:= 4*(0.5d - 2d¬≤)= 2d - 8d¬≤Now, substitute these back into equation (2):(0.25 - 2d + 4d¬≤) + (2d - 8d¬≤) + 3d¬≤ = -2Combine like terms:0.25 - 2d + 4d¬≤ + 2d - 8d¬≤ + 3d¬≤Let's see:-2d + 2d = 04d¬≤ -8d¬≤ +3d¬≤ = (4 -8 +3)d¬≤ = (-1)d¬≤So, the equation simplifies to:0.25 - d¬≤ = -2Now, let's solve for d¬≤:0.25 - d¬≤ = -2Subtract 0.25 from both sides:-d¬≤ = -2 - 0.25-d¬≤ = -2.25Multiply both sides by -1:d¬≤ = 2.25So, d = sqrt(2.25) or d = -sqrt(2.25)sqrt(2.25) is 1.5, so d = 1.5 or d = -1.5So, d = 3/2 or d = -3/2Now, let's find a_1 for each case.Case 1: d = 3/2From earlier, a_1 = 0.5 - 2d= 0.5 - 2*(3/2)= 0.5 - 3= -2.5 or -5/2Case 2: d = -3/2a_1 = 0.5 - 2*(-3/2)= 0.5 + 3= 3.5 or 7/2So, we have two possibilities:Either a_1 = -5/2 and d = 3/2Or a_1 = 7/2 and d = -3/2Now, let's check which one is consistent with the product of a_2 and a_4 being -2.First, let's check Case 1: a_1 = -5/2, d = 3/2Compute a_2 = a_1 + d = (-5/2) + (3/2) = (-5 + 3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1Compute a_4 = a_1 + 3d = (-5/2) + 3*(3/2) = (-5/2) + (9/2) = (4/2) = 2So, a_2 = -1, a_4 = 2Product: (-1)*2 = -2, which matches the given condition.Now, check Case 2: a_1 = 7/2, d = -3/2Compute a_2 = a_1 + d = (7/2) + (-3/2) = (7 - 3)/2 = 4/2 = 2Compute a_4 = a_1 + 3d = (7/2) + 3*(-3/2) = (7/2) - (9/2) = (-2)/2 = -1So, a_2 = 2, a_4 = -1Product: 2*(-1) = -2, which also matches the given condition.So, both cases are valid. Therefore, there are two possible arithmetic sequences satisfying the given conditions.Now, I need to find S_5, the sum of the first five terms.Recall that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:S_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]Alternatively, it can also be written as:S_n = n*(a_1 + a_n)/2Since I know a_1 and d for both cases, I can compute S_5 for each case.Let's compute for Case 1: a_1 = -5/2, d = 3/2Compute S_5:S_5 = 5/2 * [2a_1 + 4d]= 5/2 * [2*(-5/2) + 4*(3/2)]Compute inside the brackets:2*(-5/2) = -54*(3/2) = 6So, total inside brackets: -5 + 6 = 1Thus, S_5 = 5/2 * 1 = 5/2Alternatively, using the other formula:S_5 = 5*(a_1 + a_5)/2Compute a_5 = a_1 + 4d = (-5/2) + 4*(3/2) = (-5/2) + 6 = (-5/2 + 12/2) = 7/2So, S_5 = 5*(-5/2 + 7/2)/2 = 5*(2/2)/2 = 5*(1)/2 = 5/2Same result.Now, let's compute for Case 2: a_1 = 7/2, d = -3/2Compute S_5:S_5 = 5/2 * [2a_1 + 4d]= 5/2 * [2*(7/2) + 4*(-3/2)]Compute inside the brackets:2*(7/2) = 74*(-3/2) = -6Total inside brackets: 7 - 6 = 1Thus, S_5 = 5/2 * 1 = 5/2Alternatively, using the other formula:Compute a_5 = a_1 + 4d = (7/2) + 4*(-3/2) = (7/2) - 6 = (7/2 - 12/2) = (-5/2)So, S_5 = 5*(a_1 + a_5)/2 = 5*(7/2 + (-5/2))/2 = 5*(2/2)/2 = 5*(1)/2 = 5/2Same result.So, in both cases, S_5 = 5/2.Therefore, the answer is A: 5/2.Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.In Case 1:a_1 = -5/2, d = 3/2a_2 = -1, a_4 = 2Sum of a_2 + a_4 = 1, which matches.Product of a_2 and a_4 = -2, which matches.Sum S_5 = 5/2, which is option A.In Case 2:a_1 = 7/2, d = -3/2a_2 = 2, a_4 = -1Sum of a_2 + a_4 = 1, which matches.Product of a_2 and a_4 = -2, which matches.Sum S_5 = 5/2, same as before.So, both cases lead to S_5 = 5/2.Therefore, the correct answer is A: 5/2."},{"question":"Evaluate 101 times 101 using a similar technique.","answer":"To evaluate (101 times 101) using a similar technique, I can utilize the algebraic identity for the square of a binomial, which is ((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2).First, I'll identify suitable values for (a) and (b) that add up to 101. The most straightforward choice is (a = 100) and (b = 1), since (100 + 1 = 101).Next, I'll compute each term of the expansion:- (a^2 = 100^2 = 10000)- (2ab = 2 times 100 times 1 = 200)- (b^2 = 1^2 = 1)Finally, I'll add these results together:(10000 + 200 + 1 = 10201)Therefore, (101 times 101 = 10201)."},{"question":"Let p, q, r be the roots of the cubic polynomial x^3 - 2x - 2 = 0. Find[p(q - r)^2 + q(r - p)^2 + r(p - q)^2.]","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of the expression ( p(q - r)^2 + q(r - p)^2 + r(p - q)^2 ), where ( p, q, r ) are the roots of the cubic polynomial ( x^3 - 2x - 2 = 0 ). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that for a cubic polynomial ( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sums of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. In this case, the polynomial is ( x^3 - 2x - 2 = 0 ), so comparing it to the general form, I see that the coefficients are a bit different. Let me write down Vieta's formulas for this specific polynomial.The general form is ( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), so in our case, ( a = 0 ), ( b = -2 ), and ( c = -2 ). Therefore, Vieta's formulas tell us:1. ( p + q + r = -a = 0 )2. ( pq + qr + rp = b = -2 )3. ( pqr = -c = 2 )Okay, so we have:- Sum of roots: ( p + q + r = 0 )- Sum of products two at a time: ( pq + qr + rp = -2 )- Product of roots: ( pqr = 2 )Great, so now we have these relationships. Now, let's look at the expression we need to compute: ( p(q - r)^2 + q(r - p)^2 + r(p - q)^2 ). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can expand it and use the relationships from Vieta's formulas to simplify.Let me try expanding each term one by one. Let's start with ( p(q - r)^2 ). Expanding the square, we get:( p(q - r)^2 = p(q^2 - 2qr + r^2) = pq^2 - 2pqr + pr^2 )Similarly, expanding ( q(r - p)^2 ):( q(r - p)^2 = q(r^2 - 2rp + p^2) = qr^2 - 2qrp + qp^2 )And expanding ( r(p - q)^2 ):( r(p - q)^2 = r(p^2 - 2pq + q^2) = rp^2 - 2rpq + rq^2 )Now, if we add all these together, the entire expression becomes:( pq^2 - 2pqr + pr^2 + qr^2 - 2qrp + qp^2 + rp^2 - 2rpq + rq^2 )Hmm, let's combine like terms. First, let's collect all the terms with ( p^2 ), ( q^2 ), and ( r^2 ):- Terms with ( p^2 ): ( qp^2 + rp^2 )- Terms with ( q^2 ): ( pq^2 + rq^2 )- Terms with ( r^2 ): ( pr^2 + qr^2 )So, that's ( p^2(q + r) + q^2(p + r) + r^2(p + q) )Now, looking at the cross terms, which are the ones with ( pqr ):- We have ( -2pqr - 2qrp - 2rpq ), which is ( -6pqr )So, putting it all together, the expression simplifies to:( p^2(q + r) + q^2(p + r) + r^2(p + q) - 6pqr )Now, from Vieta's formula, we know that ( p + q + r = 0 ). So, ( q + r = -p ), ( p + r = -q ), and ( p + q = -r ). Let's substitute these into the expression:( p^2(-p) + q^2(-q) + r^2(-r) - 6pqr )Simplifying each term:- ( p^2(-p) = -p^3 )- ( q^2(-q) = -q^3 )- ( r^2(-r) = -r^3 )So, the expression becomes:( -p^3 - q^3 - r^3 - 6pqr )Now, we need to find the value of ( -p^3 - q^3 - r^3 - 6pqr ). Hmm, let's see if we can express ( p^3, q^3, r^3 ) in terms of ( p, q, r ) using the original equation.Given that ( p, q, r ) are roots of the polynomial ( x^3 - 2x - 2 = 0 ), each of them satisfies the equation:( x^3 = 2x + 2 )So, substituting for each root:- ( p^3 = 2p + 2 )- ( q^3 = 2q + 2 )- ( r^3 = 2r + 2 )Therefore, substituting these into our expression:( -p^3 - q^3 - r^3 - 6pqr = -(2p + 2) - (2q + 2) - (2r + 2) - 6pqr )Let's simplify this step by step:First, distribute the negative signs:( -2p - 2 - 2q - 2 - 2r - 2 - 6pqr )Combine like terms:- The linear terms: ( -2p - 2q - 2r )- The constants: ( -2 - 2 - 2 = -6 )- The product term: ( -6pqr )So, we have:( -2(p + q + r) - 6 - 6pqr )From Vieta's formula, we know that ( p + q + r = 0 ) and ( pqr = 2 ). Let's substitute these values in:( -2(0) - 6 - 6(2) )Simplify each term:- ( -2(0) = 0 )- ( -6 ) remains as is- ( -6(2) = -12 )So, adding them together:( 0 - 6 - 12 = -18 )Therefore, the value of the expression ( p(q - r)^2 + q(r - p)^2 + r(p - q)^2 ) is ( -18 ).Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from expanding the expression, then substituting using Vieta's, and then using the original equation to express ( p^3, q^3, r^3 ). It all seems to flow logically. The substitution steps look correct, and the arithmetic checks out. So, I think the answer is indeed ( -18 ).**Final Answer**boxed{-18}"},{"question":"A conical cup has a radius of 2 inches and height of 6 inches.

Let's start by examining each row and column to see what numbers are missing and where they can go.**First Row:**The first row has 1, 3, and 2. So, the missing numbers are 4 and 5. Looking at the columns where these are missing:- The third column already has a 5 in the second row, so the 5 in the first row must go in the fourth column.- That leaves 4 to go in the third column.So, the first row becomes:1, 3, 5, 4, 2**Second Row:**The second row has 4, 2, and 3. Missing numbers are 1 and 5.- The last column of the second row is empty. Since the first row already has a 2 in the fifth column, and the fourth row has a 4 in the fifth column, the second row's fifth column must be 5.- That leaves 1 to go in the first column.So, the second row becomes:1, 4, 2, 3, 5**Third Row:**The third row has 2 and 4. Missing numbers are 1, 3, and 5.- The second column is empty. Looking at the second column, the first row has 3, the second row has 4, the fourth row has 2, and the fifth row is empty. So, the third row's second column can be 1 or 3 or 5.- The fourth column is empty. The first row has 4, the second row has 3, the fourth row has 5, and the fifth row is empty. So, the third row's fourth column can be 1 or 2 or 3.- The fifth column is empty. The first row has 2, the second row has 5, the fourth row has 4, and the fifth row is empty. So, the third row's fifth column can be 1, 3, or 5.This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look at the columns to see if I can eliminate some possibilities.**Fourth Row:**The fourth row has 5 and 4. Missing numbers are 1, 2, and 3.- The first column is empty. The first column has 1, 1, 2, and empty. So, the fourth row's first column can be 3 or 5.- The second column is empty. The second column has 3, 4, empty, 2, and empty. So, the fourth row's second column can be 1 or 3.- The third column is empty. The third column has 5, 2, 4, empty, and empty. So, the fourth row's third column can be 1, 3, or 5.This is also a bit complicated. Maybe I should move to the fifth row.**Fifth Row:**The fifth row is completely empty. Missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.But since all other rows have some numbers filled in, maybe I can determine the fifth row based on the columns.Looking at the first column:- First column has 1, 1, 2, and empty. So, the fifth row's first column must be 3 or 5.Second column:- Second column has 3, 4, empty, 2, and empty. So, the fifth row's second column must be 1 or 5.Third column:- Third column has 5, 2, 4, empty, and empty. So, the fifth row's third column must be 1, 3, or 5.Fourth column:- Fourth column has 4, 3, 1, 5, and empty. So, the fifth row's fourth column must be 2.Fifth column:- Fifth column has 2, 5, 5, 4, and empty. Wait, the fifth column has two 5s? That can't be right because each number should appear only once in each column. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.Let me double-check the fifth column:- First row: 2- Second row: 5- Third row: 5 (Wait, in my earlier step, I thought the third row's fifth column was 5, but looking back, the third row was supposed to have 1, 3, 4, 1, 5? That doesn't make sense because 1 is repeated. I think I messed up the third row.Let me go back to the third row.**Revisiting Third Row:**Third row has 2 and 4. Missing numbers are 1, 3, and 5.- Second column: Can't be 3 because the first row has 3.- Fourth column: Can't be 4 because the first row has 4.- Fifth column: Can't be 2 because the first row has 2.Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.**Looking at Columns:**Let's examine each column to see what numbers are missing.**First Column:**- Numbers present: 1 (first row), 1 (second row), 2 (third row), empty (fourth row), empty (fifth row).- Missing numbers: 3, 4, 5.But wait, in a 5x5 grid, each column should have 1-5. So, first column has 1, 1, 2, so missing are 3, 4, 5.But the fourth row's first column can't be 1 because the second row already has 1 in the first column. Wait, no, the first column can have multiple 1s as long as each row and column has unique numbers. Wait, no, each column must have unique numbers. So, first column has two 1s, which is not allowed. That means I made a mistake earlier.In the second row, I placed 1 in the first column, but the first row already has 1 in the first column. That's a conflict. So, I need to correct that.**Correcting Second Row:**Second row has 4, 2, 3. Missing numbers are 1 and 5.- First column: Can't be 1 because first row has 1.- So, first column must be 5.- Then, fifth column must be 1.So, second row becomes:5, 4, 2, 3, 1Now, first column has 1 (first row), 5 (second row), 2 (third row), empty (fourth row), empty (fifth row). Missing numbers: 3 and 4.Fourth row's first column can be 3 or 4.Fifth row's first column can be the remaining number.**Revisiting Third Row:**Third row has 2 and 4. Missing numbers: 1, 3, 5.- Second column: Can't be 3 because first row has 3.- Fourth column: Can't be 4 because first row has 4.- Fifth column: Can't be 2 because first row has 2.Wait, this is still confusing. Maybe I should look at the fifth column.**Fifth Column:**- First row: 2- Second row: 1- Third row: empty- Fourth row: 4- Fifth row: emptyMissing numbers: 3 and 5.So, third row's fifth column can be 3 or 5.If I assume third row's fifth column is 5, then fifth column would have 2, 1, 5, 4, and the fifth row's fifth column would be 3.But let's see if that works.**Third Row:**If fifth column is 5, then third row has 2, 4, 5. Missing numbers: 1 and 3.Looking at the second column:- Second column has 3 (first row), 4 (second row), empty (third row), 2 (fourth row), empty (fifth row).- So, third row's second column can be 1 or 3.If third row's second column is 1, then third row becomes:2, 1, 4, empty, 5But then fourth column is empty. Fourth column has 4 (first row), 3 (second row), empty (third row), 5 (fourth row), empty (fifth row).So, third row's fourth column can be 1 or 2.But third row already has 2, so it must be 1.But third row already has 1 in the second column, which would be a conflict. So, that's not possible.Therefore, third row's second column must be 3.So, third row becomes:2, 3, 4, empty, 5Now, fourth column is empty. Fourth column has 4, 3, empty, 5, empty.So, third row's fourth column can be 1 or 2.But third row already has 2, so it must be 1.So, third row is:2, 3, 4, 1, 5Now, let's check the columns:**Second Column:**- First row: 3- Second row: 4- Third row: 3- Fourth row: 2- Fifth row: emptyWait, third row has 3 in the second column, but first row also has 3 in the second column. That's a conflict because each column must have unique numbers.So, this approach is incorrect.**Alternative Approach:**Maybe third row's fifth column is 3 instead of 5.So, third row's fifth column is 3.Then, fifth column has 2, 1, 3, 4, and the fifth row's fifth column would be 5.Now, third row has 2, 4, 3.

I need to prove that there exists some real number ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ) if and only if the sum of the cubes from 1 to ( n ) divides ( a ), where ( n ) is a positive integer.First, let me understand what the problem is asking. It's saying that the existence of a real number ( beta ) where ( f(beta) = 0 ) is equivalent to the sum ( 1^3 + 2^3 + dots + n^3 ) dividing ( a ). So, I need to show two things: 1. If such a ( beta ) exists, then ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ).2. If ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ), then such a ( beta ) exists.Let me start by assuming that there exists a ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ). Then, substituting ( x = beta ) into the given equation, we get:[ f(f(beta)) = beta f(beta) + a ]Since ( f(beta) = 0 ), this simplifies to:[ f(0) = 0 + a ][ f(0) = a ]So, ( f(0) = a ). Now, let's substitute ( x = 0 ) into the original equation:[ f(f(0)) = 0 cdot f(0) + a ][ f(a) = a ]So, ( f(a) = a ). Now, substituting ( x = a ) into the original equation:[ f(f(a)) = a f(a) + a ]Since ( f(a) = a ), this becomes:[ f(a) = a^2 + a ][ a = a^2 + a ]Subtracting ( a ) from both sides:[ 0 = a^2 ][ a = 0 ]Wait, so this suggests that ( a ) must be zero if such a ( beta ) exists. But the problem states that ( a ) is an integer, and we need to relate this to the sum of cubes dividing ( a ). If ( a = 0 ), then any integer divides zero, which would mean that ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ) trivially. So, that takes care of the \\"if\\" part: if there exists ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ), then ( a = 0 ), and hence ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ).Now, for the converse: if ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ), then there exists ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ). Let's denote ( S_n = sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ). So, ( S_n ) divides ( a ), meaning ( a = S_n cdot m ) for some integer ( m ).But wait, earlier we found that ( a ) must be zero for ( f(beta) = 0 ) to hold. So, unless ( S_n ) divides ( a ) only when ( a = 0 ), which isn't necessarily the case. Maybe I need to think differently.Perhaps I need to consider the functional equation more deeply. Let's assume that ( f ) is a polynomial function. Suppose ( f(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( d ). Then, ( f(f(x)) ) would be a polynomial of degree ( d^2 ). On the right-hand side, ( x f(x) + a ) is a polynomial of degree ( d + 1 ). For these to be equal, the degrees must match, so ( d^2 = d + 1 ). Solving this quadratic equation:[ d^2 - d - 1 = 0 ][ d = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ]But since the degree must be an integer, this suggests that ( f(x) ) cannot be a polynomial function. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe ( f ) isn't a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps ( f ) is linear? Let's test that.Assume ( f(x) = kx + c ), where ( k ) and ( c ) are constants. Then,[ f(f(x)) = f(kx + c) = k(kx + c) + c = k^2 x + kc + c ]On the other hand,[ x f(x) + a = x(kx + c) + a = kx^2 + cx + a ]For these to be equal for all ( x ), the coefficients must match. So,1. Coefficient of ( x^2 ): ( k = 0 )2. Coefficient of ( x ): ( k^2 = c )3. Constant term: ( kc + c = a )From the first equation, ( k = 0 ). Then, from the second equation, ( 0 = c ). From the third equation, ( 0 + 0 = a ), so ( a = 0 ).This again suggests that ( a ) must be zero for ( f ) to be linear. But the problem allows ( a ) to be any integer, so perhaps ( f ) isn't linear. Maybe it's quadratic or something else.Alternatively, let's consider specific values. Suppose ( f(0) = a ). If ( a = 0 ), then ( f(0) = 0 ). So, ( x = 0 ) is a root. But the problem is about the existence of some ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ), not necessarily ( beta = 0 ).Wait, earlier when I assumed ( f(beta) = 0 ), I concluded ( a = 0 ). So, unless ( a ) is zero, there's no such ( beta ). But the problem states that ( a ) is an integer, and we need to relate it to the sum of cubes. So, perhaps the sum of cubes must divide ( a ), but if ( a = 0 ), it's trivially divisible by any sum of cubes.But the converse is supposed to be: if the sum of cubes divides ( a ), then there exists ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ). But if ( a ) is non-zero, and the sum of cubes divides ( a ), does that imply ( f(beta) = 0 ) for some ( beta )?Wait, maybe I need to consider the functional equation more carefully. Let's denote ( f(f(x)) = x f(x) + a ). Suppose ( f ) is injective or surjective. If ( f ) is injective, then ( f(f(x)) = f(y) ) implies ( f(x) = y ). But I don't know if ( f ) is injective.Alternatively, suppose ( f ) is surjective. Then, for every ( y in mathbf{R} ), there exists an ( x ) such that ( f(x) = y ). If that's the case, then setting ( y = 0 ), there exists ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ). But the problem is stating that this is equivalent to the sum of cubes dividing ( a ).Wait, maybe I need to consider the functional equation recursively. Let's suppose ( f(beta) = 0 ). Then, as before, ( f(0) = a ). Then, substituting ( x = 0 ), we get ( f(a) = a ). Then, substituting ( x = a ), we get ( f(a) = a^2 + a ). But since ( f(a) = a ), this gives ( a = a^2 + a ), so ( a^2 = 0 ), hence ( a = 0 ).So, if ( f(beta) = 0 ), then ( a = 0 ). Conversely, if ( a = 0 ), then ( f(f(x)) = x f(x) ). Let's see if this implies ( f(beta) = 0 ) for some ( beta ).If ( a = 0 ), then ( f(f(x)) = x f(x) ). Suppose ( f ) is not identically zero. Then, there exists some ( x ) such that ( f(x) neq 0 ). Let ( x_0 ) be such that ( f(x_0) neq 0 ). Then, ( f(f(x_0)) = x_0 f(x_0) ). If ( f(x_0) neq 0 ), then ( f(f(x_0)) neq 0 ), implying ( x_0 f(x_0) neq 0 ). So, ( x_0 neq 0 ).But this doesn't directly help me find a ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ). Maybe I need to consider fixed points. A fixed point ( c ) satisfies ( f(c) = c ). From the equation, ( f(f(c)) = c f(c) + a ). If ( f(c) = c ), then ( f(c) = c = c^2 + a ). So, ( c^2 - c + a = 0 ). The discriminant is ( 1 - 4a ). For real solutions, ( 1 - 4a geq 0 ), so ( a leq 1/4 ). But ( a ) is an integer, so ( a leq 0 ).If ( a = 0 ), then ( c^2 - c = 0 ), so ( c = 0 ) or ( c = 1 ). So, fixed points at 0 and 1. If ( a neq 0 ), but ( a leq 0 ), then fixed points exist only if ( 1 - 4a geq 0 ).But I'm not sure if this helps with finding ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ).Wait, going back, if ( a = 0 ), then ( f(f(x)) = x f(x) ). Suppose ( f ) is not identically zero, then there exists some ( x ) where ( f(x) neq 0 ). Let ( x_1 ) be such that ( f(x_1) neq 0 ). Then, ( f(f(x_1)) = x_1 f(x_1) ). If ( f(x_1) neq 0 ), then ( f(f(x_1)) neq 0 ), implying ( x_1 f(x_1) neq 0 ), so ( x_1 neq 0 ).But I still don't see how to get ( f(beta) = 0 ). Maybe I need to consider the function's behavior. Suppose ( f ) is continuous. Then, if ( f ) is not identically zero, it must cross zero somewhere. But the problem doesn't state that ( f ) is continuous.Alternatively, maybe I can consider specific forms of ( f ). Suppose ( f(x) = kx ). Then,[ f(f(x)) = f(kx) = k(kx) = k^2 x ][ x f(x) + a = x(kx) + a = kx^2 + a ]For these to be equal, ( k^2 x = kx^2 + a ). This must hold for all ( x ), which is only possible if ( k = 0 ) and ( a = 0 ). So, again, ( a = 0 ).Alternatively, suppose ( f(x) = x + c ). Then,[ f(f(x)) = f(x + c) = x + c + c = x + 2c ][ x f(x) + a = x(x + c) + a = x^2 + cx + a ]For these to be equal, ( x + 2c = x^2 + cx + a ). This would require ( x^2 + (c - 1)x + (a - 2c) = 0 ) for all ( x ), which is only possible if all coefficients are zero:1. ( 1 = 0 ) (coefficient of ( x^2 )), which is impossible.So, ( f ) can't be linear unless ( a = 0 ) and ( f(x) = 0 ).Wait, if ( a = 0 ), then ( f(f(x)) = x f(x) ). Suppose ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ). Then, ( f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0 ), and ( x f(x) = 0 ), so it works. So, the zero function is a solution when ( a = 0 ).But the problem is about the existence of some ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ), not that ( f ) is identically zero. So, even if ( f ) is not identically zero, there might be some ( beta ) where ( f(beta) = 0 ).Wait, earlier I saw that if ( f(beta) = 0 ), then ( a = 0 ). So, the only way for ( f(beta) = 0 ) to hold is if ( a = 0 ). Therefore, the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) must divide ( a ). But if ( a = 0 ), then any integer divides ( a ), so ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ) trivially.Conversely, if ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ), then ( a = m sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) for some integer ( m ). But unless ( m = 0 ), ( a ) is non-zero. But earlier, we saw that if ( a neq 0 ), then ( f(beta) = 0 ) implies ( a = 0 ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, the only way for ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) to divide ( a ) is if ( a = 0 ), which in turn implies that there exists ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ).Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let me try to formalize it.If there exists ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ), then ( a = 0 ), so ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ) because ( a = 0 ).Conversely, if ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ), then ( a = m sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) for some integer ( m ). But for ( f(beta) = 0 ) to hold, we must have ( a = 0 ), which implies ( m = 0 ). Therefore, ( a = 0 ), and hence there exists ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ).So, the key point is that ( a ) must be zero for ( f(beta) = 0 ) to hold, and ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ) only when ( a = 0 ). Therefore, the existence of ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ) is equivalent to ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) dividing ( a ).But wait, the problem states \\"if and only if ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 mid a )\\", not necessarily that ( a = 0 ). So, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the sum of cubes divides ( a ), but ( a ) isn't necessarily zero. How does that relate to ( f(beta) = 0 )?Let me think differently. Suppose ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ), so ( a = k sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) for some integer ( k ). Then, perhaps there's a way to construct ( f ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ). But earlier, I saw that if ( f(beta) = 0 ), then ( a = 0 ). So, unless ( k = 0 ), which would make ( a = 0 ), this seems contradictory.Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm assuming ( f(beta) = 0 ) implies ( a = 0 ), but perhaps there's a way for ( a ) to be non-zero and still have ( f(beta) = 0 ). Let me check.Suppose ( f(beta) = 0 ). Then, as before, ( f(0) = a ). Then, substituting ( x = 0 ), ( f(a) = a ). Then, substituting ( x = a ), ( f(a) = a^2 + a ). Since ( f(a) = a ), this gives ( a = a^2 + a ), so ( a^2 = 0 ), hence ( a = 0 ). So, indeed, ( a ) must be zero if ( f(beta) = 0 ).Therefore, the only way for ( f(beta) = 0 ) to hold is if ( a = 0 ), which means ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ) because ( a = 0 ). Conversely, if ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ), then ( a = 0 ), and hence ( f(beta) = 0 ) for some ( beta ).Wait, but the problem says \\"if and only if ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 mid a )\\", not necessarily that ( a = 0 ). So, perhaps the sum of cubes divides ( a ), but ( a ) isn't necessarily zero. How does that relate to ( f(beta) = 0 )?I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to rephrase.The problem is stating that there exists ( beta ) such that ( f(beta) = 0 ) if and only if ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ). From my earlier reasoning, if ( f(beta) = 0 ), then ( a = 0 ), so ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ) because ( a = 0 ). Conversely, if ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ), then ( a = 0 ), so ( f(beta) = 0 ) for some ( beta ).Therefore, the statement holds because both directions lead to ( a = 0 ), which is equivalent to ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) dividing ( a ).But wait, the sum of cubes ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) is a specific integer, and ( a ) is an integer. So, ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ) means that ( a ) is a multiple of ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ). However, from the functional equation, we saw that ( a ) must be zero for ( f(beta) = 0 ) to hold. Therefore, the only way ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) divides ( a ) is if ( a = 0 ), which in turn implies ( f(beta) = 0 ).So, the equivalence is that ( f(beta) = 0 ) exists if and only if ( a = 0 ), which is equivalent to ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 ) dividing ( a ) because ( a = 0 ).Therefore, the proof is complete."},{"question":"Given sin theta + cos theta = frac{1}{3}, the value of sin 2theta is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given that sin Œ∏ plus cos Œ∏ equals 1/3, and I need to find the value of sin 2Œ∏. Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that relate sin Œ∏ and cos Œ∏ to sin 2Œ∏. Specifically, I recall that sin 2Œ∏ is equal to 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏. So, if I can find the value of sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏, I can just multiply it by 2 to get sin 2Œ∏. That seems like a good plan.But wait, I only know the sum of sin Œ∏ and cos Œ∏, not their product. How can I find sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ from sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏? Hmm, maybe I can square both sides of the equation. I remember that squaring a sum gives me the square of each term plus twice the product. Let me try that.So, if I square both sides of sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = 1/3, I get:(sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏)^2 = (1/3)^2Expanding the left side, that becomes:sin¬≤Œ∏ + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1/9Now, I remember another identity: sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ equals 1. So, I can substitute that into the equation:1 + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = 1/9Okay, so now I have 1 plus twice the product of sin Œ∏ and cos Œ∏ equals 1/9. I need to solve for sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏. Let me subtract 1 from both sides:2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = 1/9 - 1Calculating the right side, 1/9 minus 1 is the same as 1/9 minus 9/9, which equals -8/9. So now I have:2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = -8/9But wait, I know that 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ is equal to sin 2Œ∏. So, substituting that in:sin 2Œ∏ = -8/9So, that should be the value of sin 2Œ∏. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Started with sin Œ∏ + cos Œ∏ = 1/3.2. Squared both sides to get sin¬≤Œ∏ + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1/9.3. Replaced sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ with 1, resulting in 1 + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = 1/9.4. Subtracted 1 from both sides to find 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = -8/9.5. Recognized that 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ is sin 2Œ∏, so sin 2Œ∏ = -8/9.Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, I think the value of sin 2Œ∏ is indeed -8/9.**Final Answer**The value of sin 2theta is boxed{-dfrac{8}{9}}."},{"question":"There are two symmetrical dice. Is it possible to write certain numbers on their faces in such a way that the sum of the points when rolling takes on values 1, 2, ldots, 36 with equal probabilities?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two symmetrical dice, and I need to figure out if it's possible to label their faces with certain numbers so that when you roll them, the sums from 1 to 36 all come up with equal probabilities. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break this down.First, I know that a standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. When you roll two standard dice, the possible sums range from 2 to 12, and each sum has a different probability because there are multiple combinations that can result in the same sum. For example, a sum of 7 can be achieved in six different ways, making it the most probable sum.But in this problem, we need the sums to range from 1 to 36, and each of these sums should have the same probability. That means every number from 1 to 36 should be equally likely when rolling these two dice. That seems like a big range compared to standard dice, which only go up to 12. So, I guess we need to label the dice in a way that allows for a much wider range of sums.Let me think about how many possible outcomes there are when rolling two dice. Each die has six faces, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. That's exactly the number of sums we need (from 1 to 36). So, if we can arrange the numbers on the dice such that each outcome corresponds to a unique sum, then each sum from 1 to 36 would indeed have an equal probability of 1/36.Okay, so the key here is to label the dice in a way that each possible combination of the two dice results in a unique sum, covering all numbers from 1 to 36. That sounds like a problem of assigning numbers to the dice faces such that the sums are all distinct and cover the entire range.I remember something about \\"Sicherman dice,\\" which are non-standard dice that produce the same sum distribution as standard dice but with different face labels. Maybe there's a similar concept here, but instead of matching the standard distribution, we need to create a distribution that covers every number from 1 to 36 exactly once.Let me try to think of how to assign numbers to the dice. Let's denote the numbers on the first die as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 ) and the numbers on the second die as ( b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6 ). We need the sums ( a_i + b_j ) for all ( i, j ) to be exactly the numbers from 1 to 36, each appearing exactly once.One approach might be to have one die increment by 1 and the other die increment by 6. For example, if the first die has numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the second die has numbers 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, then the sums would range from 0 to 35. But wait, that's only 36 sums, but we need them to start from 1, not 0. Maybe we can adjust the numbers to start from 1.If the first die has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the second die has numbers 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, then the sums would range from 1 to 36. Let's check:- The smallest sum is 1 + 0 = 1- The largest sum is 6 + 30 = 36And each number in between should be achievable. For example:- 2 can be 2 + 0- 3 can be 3 + 0- ...- 6 can be 6 + 0- 7 can be 1 + 6- 8 can be 2 + 6- ...- 12 can be 6 + 6- 13 can be 1 + 12- And so on, up to 36.Wait, does this cover all numbers from 1 to 36 without missing any? Let's see:- For numbers 1 to 6: They can be achieved by adding 0 to the corresponding number on the first die.- For numbers 7 to 12: They can be achieved by adding 6 to the corresponding number on the first die.- Similarly, 13 to 18: Add 12- 19 to 24: Add 18- 25 to 30: Add 24- 31 to 36: Add 30Yes, this seems to cover all numbers from 1 to 36. Each number is achieved by exactly one combination of the two dice. Therefore, each sum from 1 to 36 has an equal probability of 1/36.So, it looks like it is possible to label the dice in such a way. The first die can be labeled with numbers 1 through 6, and the second die can be labeled with multiples of 6: 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30. This ensures that every sum from 1 to 36 is possible and each occurs exactly once, giving them equal probabilities.I should double-check to make sure there are no overlaps or missing numbers. Let's list out the sums:- Adding 0 to 1-6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6- Adding 6 to 1-6: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12- Adding 12 to 1-6: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18- Adding 18 to 1-6: 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24- Adding 24 to 1-6: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30- Adding 30 to 1-6: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36Yes, that's all numbers from 1 to 36, each exactly once. So, this labeling works.Another thought: What if we tried a different labeling? For example, if both dice had numbers that weren't multiples of 6, would that still work? Probably not, because then the sums might overlap or skip numbers. The key here is that one die increments by 1, and the other increments by 6, which allows the sums to cover the entire range without gaps or overlaps.Also, since both dice are symmetrical, meaning each face has an equal probability of landing face up, this labeling ensures that each sum is equally likely. There's no bias towards any particular sum because each combination of faces is equally probable.In conclusion, by labeling one die with numbers 1 through 6 and the other die with multiples of 6 (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30), we can achieve the desired result where the sums from 1 to 36 each have an equal probability of occurring."},{"question":"A math teacher proposed changing the voting scheme for a play contest. According to her, a jury of 2m people (2m leq n) should be randomly selected from all 2n moms. Find the probability that the best play will win under these voting conditions.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a math teacher wants to change the voting scheme for a play contest. There are 2n moms, and she suggests selecting a jury of 2m people randomly from these moms. I need to find the probability that the best play will win under these conditions. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I need to understand the setup. There are 2n moms, and we're selecting 2m of them to form a jury. The goal is to find the probability that the best play wins. I assume that each mom votes for a play, and the best play is the one that should win if the voting is fair. But since the problem is about probability, there must be some uncertainty or randomness involved in how the moms vote.Wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about the moms being biased or honest. Maybe I need to make some assumptions here. Perhaps some moms are more likely to vote for the best play, while others might have personal biases, like voting for their own child's play regardless of its quality. That could complicate things.Let me think. If we have 2n moms, maybe half of them are \\"honest\\" and will vote for the best play, and the other half are \\"dishonest\\" and will vote for their child's play, which might not necessarily be the best. That seems like a reasonable assumption since it introduces a conflict between honest and dishonest voting.So, if there are 2n moms, n are honest and n are dishonest. The jury is selected randomly from these 2n moms, and the size of the jury is 2m. The best play will win if it gets more votes than any other play. Since we're dealing with probability, I need to calculate the chance that the number of honest votes for the best play exceeds the number of dishonest votes for any other play.Wait, but how many plays are there? The problem doesn't specify. Maybe it's just two plays: the best play and the worst play. That simplifies things. So, the jury will vote between the best play and the worst play. The best play will win if it gets more votes than the worst play.So, in this scenario, the honest moms will vote for the best play, and the dishonest moms will vote for the worst play (assuming their child is in the worst play). But actually, the problem says \\"the best play will win,\\" so maybe the dishonest moms are voting for their child's play, which could be either the best or the worst. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, maybe all the dishonest moms have children in the worst play, so they will all vote for the worst play. That would make the problem symmetric. So, n honest moms vote for the best play, and n dishonest moms vote for the worst play. Then, when we select a jury of 2m moms, the number of honest and dishonest moms in the jury will determine the outcome.So, the probability that the best play wins is the probability that, in the jury, the number of honest moms (who vote for the best play) is greater than the number of dishonest moms (who vote for the worst play). Since the jury size is 2m, we need the number of honest moms in the jury to be greater than m.Wait, no. If the jury size is 2m, then the best play needs more than half the votes, so more than m votes. So, the number of honest moms in the jury needs to be greater than m.So, the probability that the best play wins is the probability that, when selecting 2m moms from 2n, the number of honest moms selected is greater than m.But wait, the honest moms are n in total, and the dishonest moms are also n. So, the number of honest moms in the jury can range from 0 to 2m, but since there are only n honest moms, the maximum number of honest moms in the jury is n, but 2m is less than or equal to n, so 2m ‚â§ n. Therefore, the maximum number of honest moms in the jury is 2m, but since n ‚â• 2m, it's possible to have up to 2m honest moms in the jury.Wait, no. The total number of honest moms is n, and the jury size is 2m, so the number of honest moms in the jury can range from max(0, 2m - n) to min(2m, n). But since 2m ‚â§ n, the number of honest moms in the jury can range from 0 to 2m.But we need the number of honest moms in the jury to be greater than m for the best play to win. So, the probability is the sum over k from m+1 to 2m of the probability that exactly k honest moms are selected in the jury.The probability of selecting exactly k honest moms and (2m - k) dishonest moms is given by the hypergeometric distribution:P(k) = [C(n, k) * C(n, 2m - k)] / C(2n, 2m)Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.Therefore, the probability that the best play wins is the sum from k = m+1 to 2m of [C(n, k) * C(n, 2m - k)] / C(2n, 2m).But wait, let me make sure. Since the jury is selected randomly, the number of honest moms in the jury follows a hypergeometric distribution with parameters N = 2n, K = n, n = 2m.Yes, that's correct. So, the probability mass function is:P(k) = [C(n, k) * C(n, 2m - k)] / C(2n, 2m)And we need to sum this from k = m+1 to 2m.Alternatively, since the total probability is 1, and the probability that the best play wins is the same as the probability that the number of honest moms in the jury is greater than m, which is the same as 1 minus the probability that the number of honest moms is less than or equal to m.But calculating it directly might be more straightforward.So, the final probability is:Sum from k = m+1 to 2m of [C(n, k) * C(n, 2m - k)] / C(2n, 2m)I think that's the answer. Let me see if I can simplify it further or if there's a combinatorial identity that can help.Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry or a way to express this sum in terms of binomial coefficients or something else.Wait, another approach: Since the jury is selected randomly, the number of honest moms in the jury is equally likely to be any number from 0 to 2m, but weighted by the hypergeometric distribution. However, due to the symmetry of the problem (n honest and n dishonest), the probability that the number of honest moms is greater than m is equal to the probability that the number of dishonest moms is greater than m, which is the same as the probability that the number of honest moms is less than m.But since the total probability must sum to 1, and the probability of exactly m honest moms is some value, we have:P(k > m) = P(k < m) = (1 - P(k = m)) / 2Therefore, the probability that the best play wins is (1 - P(k = m)) / 2So, P(k > m) = (1 - [C(n, m) * C(n, m)] / C(2n, 2m)) / 2That's an interesting approach. Let me check if this makes sense.Yes, because the distribution is symmetric around m, since the number of honest and dishonest moms are equal. Therefore, the probability that the number of honest moms is greater than m is equal to the probability that it's less than m, and the remaining probability is that it's exactly m.Therefore, P(k > m) = (1 - P(k = m)) / 2So, that's a simpler expression.Therefore, the probability that the best play wins is:[1 - C(n, m)^2 / C(2n, 2m)] / 2That's a neat result. Let me see if I can verify it with a small example.Suppose n = 2, so there are 4 moms: 2 honest and 2 dishonest. Let's choose a jury of 2m = 2, so m = 1.Then, the probability that the best play wins is the probability that the number of honest moms in the jury is greater than 1, i.e., 2.The total number of ways to choose 2 moms from 4 is C(4, 2) = 6.The number of ways to choose 2 honest moms is C(2, 2) = 1.Therefore, the probability is 1/6.Using the formula I derived:[1 - C(2, 1)^2 / C(4, 2)] / 2 = [1 - (2)^2 / 6] / 2 = [1 - 4/6] / 2 = [2/6] / 2 = (1/3) / 2 = 1/6Which matches the direct calculation. So, the formula works in this case.Another example: n = 3, m = 1, so 2m = 2.Total number of ways to choose 2 moms from 6 is C(6, 2) = 15.Number of ways to choose 2 honest moms: C(3, 2) = 3.Probability that the best play wins: 3/15 = 1/5.Using the formula:[1 - C(3, 1)^2 / C(6, 2)] / 2 = [1 - (3)^2 / 15] / 2 = [1 - 9/15] / 2 = [6/15] / 2 = (2/5) / 2 = 1/5Again, it matches.Therefore, the formula seems correct.So, the probability that the best play wins is:[1 - (C(n, m))^2 / C(2n, 2m)] / 2I think that's the final answer."},{"question":"Jen has 10 more ducks than four times the number of chickens.

I know that Jen has 10 more ducks than four times the number of chickens, and she has a total of 150 ducks.I'll start by setting up the equation based on the given information:D = 4C + 10Where D represents the number of ducks and C represents the number of chickens.Since I know that D is 150, I can substitute that into the equation:150 = 4C + 10Next, I'll solve for C by isolating it on one side of the equation:150 - 10 = 4C140 = 4CC = 140 / 4C = 35So, Jen has 35 chickens.Finally, to find the total number of birds, I'll add the number of ducks and chickens together:Total birds = D + CTotal birds = 150 + 35Total birds = 185Therefore, Jen has a total of 185 birds."},{"question":"If the function f(x)=x^{3}-2ax+a has no extremum in (0,1), then the range of the real number a is (quad)  A: left[0, frac{3}{2}right]  B: (-infty,0)  C: left[frac{3}{2},+inftyright)  D: (-infty,0]cupleft[frac{3}{2},+inftyright)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function f(x) = x¬≥ - 2a x + a has no extremum in the interval (0,1). I need to find the range of the real number a. The options are A: [0, 3/2], B: (-‚àû, 0), C: [3/2, +‚àû), and D: (-‚àû, 0] ‚à™ [3/2, +‚àû). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that to find extrema of a function, we look at its critical points by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero. So, let me compute the derivative of f(x). f'(x) = d/dx [x¬≥ - 2a x + a] = 3x¬≤ - 2a.Okay, so f'(x) = 3x¬≤ - 2a. To find critical points, set f'(x) = 0:3x¬≤ - 2a = 0  => 3x¬≤ = 2a  => x¬≤ = (2a)/3  => x = ¬±‚àö(2a/3).So, the critical points are at x = ‚àö(2a/3) and x = -‚àö(2a/3). But since we're only concerned with the interval (0,1), the negative critical point x = -‚àö(2a/3) is outside this interval. So, the only critical point we need to consider is x = ‚àö(2a/3).Now, for the function to have no extremum in (0,1), this critical point x = ‚àö(2a/3) must lie outside the interval (0,1). That means either ‚àö(2a/3) ‚â§ 0 or ‚àö(2a/3) ‚â• 1.But ‚àö(2a/3) is always non-negative, so ‚àö(2a/3) ‚â§ 0 only when a = 0. So, if a = 0, the critical point is at x = 0, which is the endpoint of the interval (0,1). Since we're only considering the open interval (0,1), x=0 isn't included. So, when a = 0, does the function have an extremum in (0,1)? Let me check.If a = 0, f(x) = x¬≥. The derivative is f'(x) = 3x¬≤, which is always non-negative. So, the function is monotonically increasing on (0,1), meaning there are no extrema in (0,1). So, a = 0 is acceptable.Now, the other case is when ‚àö(2a/3) ‚â• 1. Let's solve this inequality:‚àö(2a/3) ‚â• 1  => 2a/3 ‚â• 1  => 2a ‚â• 3  => a ‚â• 3/2.So, if a is greater than or equal to 3/2, the critical point x = ‚àö(2a/3) is at least 1, which is outside the interval (0,1). Therefore, in this case, the function f(x) has no extremum in (0,1).Wait, but what if a is negative? Let me think. If a is negative, then 2a is negative, so 2a/3 is negative. Then, ‚àö(2a/3) would involve taking the square root of a negative number, which isn't a real number. So, if a is negative, the derivative f'(x) = 3x¬≤ - 2a is always positive because 3x¬≤ is non-negative and -2a is positive (since a is negative). Therefore, f'(x) is always positive, meaning the function is strictly increasing on (0,1), so there are no extrema in (0,1). So, for a < 0, the function is increasing on (0,1), so no extrema. For a = 0, as we saw, the function is also increasing, so no extrema. For a > 0, we have a critical point at x = ‚àö(2a/3). If this critical point is inside (0,1), then the function has an extremum there, which we don't want. So, to ensure that the critical point is outside (0,1), we need a ‚â• 3/2.Therefore, combining these cases, the values of a for which f(x) has no extremum in (0,1) are a ‚â§ 0 or a ‚â• 3/2. So, the range of a is (-‚àû, 0] ‚à™ [3/2, +‚àû).Looking back at the options, option D is (-‚àû, 0] ‚à™ [3/2, +‚àû), which matches our conclusion. So, the answer should be D.Wait, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me double-check.If a is between 0 and 3/2, say a = 1, then ‚àö(2*1/3) = ‚àö(2/3) ‚âà 0.816, which is in (0,1). So, the function would have an extremum there, which we don't want. So, a cannot be between 0 and 3/2. That's why a has to be either ‚â§0 or ‚â•3/2.Yes, that makes sense.

Hmm, that sounds like it's related to the characteristic equation of the matrix, maybe? I remember something about the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, which says that a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. So, if I can find the characteristic polynomial of B, then I can set up the equation and find the coefficients a, b, and c.First, let me write down the matrix B again to make sure I have it correctly:B = [[1, 2, 3],     [2, 1, 2],     [3, 2, 1]]Alright, to find the characteristic polynomial, I need to compute the determinant of (B - ŒªI), where Œª is an eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. The characteristic polynomial will be of the form Œª¬≥ + aŒª¬≤ + bŒª + c = 0, and according to Cayley-Hamilton, B should satisfy this equation.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the general method.

So, substituting B into the equation:B¬≥ - 3B¬≤ - 14B - 8I = 0But in the problem, the equation is given as:B¬≥ + aB¬≤ + bB + cI = 0So, comparing the two equations:B¬≥ - 3B¬≤ - 14B - 8I = 0andB¬≥ + aB¬≤ + bB + cI = 0We can equate the coefficients:a = -3b = -14c = -8Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes signs can be tricky.In the characteristic equation, it's Œª¬≥ - 3Œª¬≤ -14Œª -8 = 0, so substituting B, we have:B¬≥ - 3B¬≤ -14B -8I = 0Which can be rewritten as:B¬≥ + (-3)B¬≤ + (-14)B + (-8)I = 0Therefore, a = -3, b = -14, c = -8So, the ordered triple is (-3, -14, -8)But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the determinant.Let me go back through the steps.First, (B - ŒªI) is correct.Then, the minors:First minor: (1 - Œª)(1 - Œª) - 2*2 = (1 - 2Œª + Œª¬≤) - 4 = Œª¬≤ - 2Œª - 3. That seems correct.Second minor: 2*(1 - Œª) - 2*3 = 2 - 2Œª - 6 = -4 - 2Œª. Correct.Third minor: 2*2 - (1 - Œª)*3 = 4 - 3 + 3Œª = 1 + 3Œª. Correct.Then, the determinant expansion:(1 - Œª)(Œª¬≤ - 2Œª - 3) - 2*(-4 - 2Œª) + 3*(1 + 3Œª)First term: (1 - Œª)(Œª¬≤ - 2Œª - 3) = Œª¬≤ - 2Œª - 3 - Œª¬≥ + 2Œª¬≤ + 3Œª = -Œª¬≥ + 3Œª¬≤ + Œª - 3. Correct.Second term: -2*(-4 - 2Œª) = 8 + 4Œª. Correct.Third term: 3*(1 + 3Œª) = 3 + 9Œª. Correct.Adding them up: (-Œª¬≥ + 3Œª¬≤ + Œª - 3) + (8 + 4Œª) + (3 + 9Œª) = -Œª¬≥ + 3Œª¬≤ + (1 + 4 + 9)Œª + (-3 + 8 + 3) = -Œª¬≥ + 3Œª¬≤ +14Œª +8. Correct.So, characteristic polynomial is -Œª¬≥ + 3Œª¬≤ +14Œª +8 = 0, which is equivalent to Œª¬≥ -3Œª¬≤ -14Œª -8 =0.Therefore, the coefficients are a=-3, b=-14, c=-8.Wait, but in the problem statement, the equation is B¬≥ + aB¬≤ + bB + cI = 0, so comparing:B¬≥ -3B¬≤ -14B -8I =0 is equivalent to B¬≥ + (-3)B¬≤ + (-14)B + (-8)I =0.So, indeed, a=-3, b=-14, c=-8.But just to be thorough, maybe I should compute B¬≤ and B¬≥ directly and set up the equation to solve for a, b, c.Let me try that approach as a verification.First, compute B¬≤:B = [[1,2,3],[2,1,2],[3,2,1]]Compute B¬≤ = B*B.Let me compute each element:First row:(1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3, 1*2 + 2*1 + 3*2, 1*3 + 2*2 + 3*1)Compute each:First element: 1 + 4 + 9 =14Second element: 2 + 2 + 6 =10Third element:3 +4 +3=10Wait, wait, let me compute each element step by step.First row, first column:1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 =1 +4 +9=14First row, second column:1*2 + 2*1 + 3*2=2 +2 +6=10First row, third column:1*3 + 2*2 + 3*1=3 +4 +3=10Second row:Second row of B is [2,1,2]Second row, first column:2*1 +1*2 +2*3=2 +2 +6=10Second row, second column:2*2 +1*1 +2*2=4 +1 +4=9Second row, third column:2*3 +1*2 +2*1=6 +2 +2=10Third row:Third row of B is [3,2,1]Third row, first column:3*1 +2*2 +1*3=3 +4 +3=10Third row, second column:3*2 +2*1 +1*2=6 +2 +2=10Third row, third column:3*3 +2*2 +1*1=9 +4 +1=14So, B¬≤ is:[[14,10,10], [10,9,10], [10,10,14]]Wait, that's different from my initial thought. I thought the (1,3) element was 14, but actually, it's 10. Let me check again.Wait, in the first row, third column, it's 1*3 + 2*2 + 3*1=3 +4 +3=10. Yes, correct.Similarly, third row, third column: 3*3 +2*2 +1*1=9 +4 +1=14.So, B¬≤ is:14 10 1010 9 1010 10 14Now, compute B¬≥ = B¬≤ * B.Let me compute each element of B¬≥.First row of B¬≤ is [14,10,10]Multiply by B:First row, first column:14*1 +10*2 +10*3=14 +20 +30=64First row, second column:14*2 +10*1 +10*2=28 +10 +20=58First row, third column:14*3 +10*2 +10*1=42 +20 +10=72Second row of B¬≤ is [10,9,10]Second row, first column:10*1 +9*2 +10*3=10 +18 +30=58Second row, second column:10*2 +9*1 +10*2=20 +9 +20=49Second row, third column:10*3 +9*2 +10*1=30 +18 +10=58Third row of B¬≤ is [10,10,14]Third row, first column:10*1 +10*2 +14*3=10 +20 +42=72Third row, second column:10*2 +10*1 +14*2=20 +10 +28=58Third row, third column:10*3 +10*2 +14*1=30 +20 +14=64So, B¬≥ is:[[64,58,72], [58,49,58], [72,58,64]]Now, the equation is B¬≥ + aB¬≤ + bB + cI = 0.Let me write this as:B¬≥ + aB¬≤ + bB + cI = 0So, let's compute each term:B¬≥ is as above.aB¬≤ is a times B¬≤:a*[[14,10,10],[10,9,10],[10,10,14]]bB is b times B:b*[[1,2,3],[2,1,2],[3,2,1]]cI is c times identity matrix:c*[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]Adding all these together should give the zero matrix.So, let's write the equation element-wise.Let me denote the (i,j) element of B¬≥ as B¬≥_ij, similarly for B¬≤ and B.So, for each element (i,j), we have:B¬≥_ij + a*B¬≤_ij + b*B_ij + c*Œ¥_ij = 0Where Œ¥_ij is 1 if i=j, else 0.So, let's write equations for each element.First, let's take the (1,1) element:64 + a*14 + b*1 + c*1 = 0Similarly, (1,2):58 + a*10 + b*2 + c*0 = 0(1,3):72 + a*10 + b*3 + c*0 = 0Similarly, (2,1):58 + a*10 + b*2 + c*0 = 0(2,2):49 + a*9 + b*1 + c*1 = 0(2,3):58 + a*10 + b*2 + c*0 = 0(3,1):72 + a*10 + b*3 + c*0 = 0(3,2):58 + a*10 + b*2 + c*0 = 0(3,3):64 + a*14 + b*1 + c*1 = 0Now, notice that many of these equations are duplicates. For example, (1,2) and (2,1) and (2,3) and (3,2) are the same. Similarly, (1,3) and (3,1) are the same. So, we can focus on the unique equations.Let me list the unique equations:1. (1,1): 64 + 14a + b + c = 02. (1,2): 58 + 10a + 2b = 03. (1,3): 72 + 10a + 3b = 04. (2,2): 49 + 9a + b + c = 05. (3,3): 64 + 14a + b + c = 0Wait, equations 1 and 5 are the same, as are equations 2 and 3 with different coefficients.Wait, equation 1: 64 +14a + b + c =0Equation 4:49 +9a + b + c=0Equation 2:58 +10a +2b=0Equation 3:72 +10a +3b=0So, we have four equations:1. 64 +14a + b + c =02. 58 +10a +2b =03. 72 +10a +3b =04. 49 +9a + b + c =0Let me write them as:Equation 1: 14a + b + c = -64Equation 2:10a +2b = -58Equation 3:10a +3b = -72Equation 4:9a + b + c = -49Now, let's solve these equations.First, let's subtract Equation 4 from Equation 1:(14a + b + c) - (9a + b + c) = (-64) - (-49)14a -9a = -64 +495a = -15So, a = -15 /5 = -3So, a = -3Now, substitute a = -3 into Equations 2 and 3.Equation 2:10*(-3) +2b = -58-30 +2b = -582b = -58 +30 = -28b = -14Equation 3:10*(-3) +3b = -72-30 +3b = -723b = -72 +30 = -42b = -14Consistent, so b = -14Now, substitute a = -3 and b = -14 into Equation 4:9*(-3) + (-14) + c = -49-27 -14 + c = -49-41 + c = -49c = -49 +41 = -8So, c = -8Therefore, the coefficients are a = -3, b = -14, c = -8So, the ordered triple is (-3, -14, -8)Wait, that's the same result as before, so that's consistent.Therefore, the answer is (-3, -14, -8)**Final Answer**The ordered triple is boxed{(-3, -14, -8)}."},{"question":"A cube with edge length 2 cm has a dot marked in the center of the top face. The cube is placed on a flat surface and is rolled over its edges in a specific sequence without lifting or slipping, such that during the initial roll, one vertex remains in contact with the surface. The cube completes one full cycle of motion until the dot is again on the top face. Find the length of the path followed by the dot in terms of pi.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a cube with edge length 2 cm. There's a dot marked in the center of the top face. The cube is placed on a flat surface and rolled over its edges in a specific sequence without lifting or slipping. During the initial roll, one vertex remains in contact with the surface. The cube completes one full cycle of motion until the dot is again on the top face. I need to find the length of the path followed by the dot in terms of œÄ.Alright, let me try to visualize this. The cube is sitting on a flat surface, and the dot is right in the center of the top face. When the cube rolls over an edge, it's going to pivot around one of its vertices. Since it's rolling without slipping, the motion should be smooth, and the dot will trace some kind of circular path as the cube rotates.First, let me think about the cube's structure. Each edge is 2 cm, so each face is a 2x2 cm square. The dot is at the center of the top face, so its coordinates relative to the cube's vertices can be determined. If I consider the cube in a 3D coordinate system, with one vertex at the origin (0,0,0), the center of the top face would be at (1,1,2), assuming the cube is oriented so that the top face is along the z-axis.But maybe I don't need to get too deep into coordinates. Instead, I should focus on the geometry of the cube and the path the dot takes when the cube rolls. When the cube rolls over an edge, it's rotating around one of its vertices. So, the dot will move in a circular path around that vertex.Let me try to figure out the radius of this circular path. The dot is at the center of the top face, so it's 1 cm away from each edge of that face. When the cube rolls over an edge, the dot will move in a circle whose radius is the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex.Wait, so the pivot vertex is one of the cube's vertices. The dot is at the center of the top face, so the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex isn't just along one edge. It's a diagonal distance through the cube.Let me think about that. If the cube is rolling over an edge, the pivot vertex is one corner of the top face. The dot is at the center of the top face, so the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is the space diagonal of a smaller cube or something?No, wait. The dot is on the top face, and the pivot vertex is also on the top face. So, actually, the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is the distance from the center of the square to one of its corners.Since each edge is 2 cm, the center of the square is 1 cm away from each edge. The distance from the center to a corner can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The center is at (1,1) on the square, and a corner is at (0,0). So, the distance is sqrt((1)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(2) cm.Wait, but that's just on the top face. But when the cube rolls, the pivot vertex is on the surface, so the dot is moving in 3D space. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex in 3D.Let me think. The pivot vertex is on the bottom face, right? Because the cube is rolling over an edge, so one vertex stays in contact with the surface. So, the pivot vertex is on the bottom face, and the dot is on the top face.So, the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is the space diagonal of a rectangular prism with sides 1 cm, 1 cm, and 2 cm. Because the dot is 1 cm away from the edge on the top face, and the pivot vertex is 2 cm below on the bottom face.So, the distance would be sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(1 + 1 + 4) = sqrt(6) cm.Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If the dot is at the center of the top face, which is 2 cm above the bottom face, and the pivot vertex is at a corner of the bottom face, then the horizontal distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2) cm, and the vertical distance is 2 cm. So, the total distance is sqrt((sqrt(2))^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(2 + 4) = sqrt(6) cm. Yeah, that makes sense.So, the radius of the circular path that the dot takes is sqrt(6) cm. Now, when the cube rolls over an edge, it's rotating 90 degrees around the pivot vertex. So, the dot moves along a quarter-circle with radius sqrt(6) cm.The length of a quarter-circle is (1/4) * 2œÄr = (1/4) * 2œÄ*sqrt(6) = (œÄ*sqrt(6))/2 cm.But wait, the cube doesn't just roll over one edge. It completes a full cycle, meaning it rolls over multiple edges until the dot is back on top. So, how many rolls does it take for the dot to return to the top face?Let me think about the cube's movement. Each roll moves the cube to a new face, and the dot moves to a new position. To get back to the original position, the cube must have rolled over all four edges around the pivot vertex, right?Wait, no. Actually, when you roll a cube over its edges, it's similar to moving it along a path where each roll changes the face in contact with the surface. For the dot to return to the top face, the cube must have gone through a sequence of rolls that brings it back to the original orientation.I think it takes four rolls for the cube to complete a full cycle and return the dot to the top face. Each roll is a 90-degree rotation around a pivot vertex, and after four such rolls, the cube would have rotated 360 degrees, bringing the dot back to the top.So, if each roll causes the dot to trace a quarter-circle of length (œÄ*sqrt(6))/2 cm, then four rolls would result in a total path length of 4 * (œÄ*sqrt(6))/2 = 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.Wait, but earlier I thought the radius was sqrt(6), but in the initial problem, the cube has edge length 2 cm, so maybe I made a mistake in calculating the radius.Let me go back. The dot is at the center of the top face, which is 2 cm above the bottom face. The pivot vertex is on the bottom face, at a corner. The horizontal distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2) cm, as the dot is 1 cm away from each edge on the top face.So, the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is sqrt((sqrt(2))^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(2 + 4) = sqrt(6) cm. So, that part seems correct.But wait, when the cube rolls over an edge, it's not just rotating around the pivot vertex, but also translating along the surface. So, does the dot's path consist of multiple circular arcs, each corresponding to a roll?Yes, each roll causes the dot to move along a quarter-circle, and after four rolls, it completes a full circle. But wait, no, because each roll is a 90-degree rotation, so four rolls would make a full 360-degree rotation, but the dot's path is not a full circle, because the cube is moving forward each time.Wait, maybe I need to think about the total rotation of the cube. Each roll rotates the cube 90 degrees around the pivot vertex, but the cube also translates along the surface. So, the dot's path is a combination of rotation and translation.Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the cube's movement as a series of rotations, each around a different pivot vertex, and calculate the total path length accordingly.Let me try to break it down step by step.1. Start with the cube on the surface, dot at the center of the top face.2. Roll the cube over one edge, pivoting around a vertex. The dot moves along a quarter-circle with radius sqrt(6) cm.3. After the first roll, the cube is on a new face, and the dot is now on a different face.4. Roll the cube again over another edge, pivoting around a different vertex. The dot moves along another quarter-circle.5. Repeat this process until the dot returns to the top face.How many rolls does it take for the dot to return to the top face? Let's see.Each roll moves the cube to an adjacent face. The cube has six faces, but since we're rolling in a specific sequence, it might take four rolls to return to the original face.Wait, actually, when rolling a cube, the number of rolls needed to return to the original face depends on the path taken. If you roll in a square pattern, it would take four rolls to return to the starting face.So, if the cube rolls over four edges, each time pivoting around a vertex, it would complete a full cycle and bring the dot back to the top face.Therefore, the dot would trace four quarter-circles, each with radius sqrt(6) cm, resulting in a total path length of 4 * (œÄ*sqrt(6))/2 = 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.But wait, I'm not sure if the radius is sqrt(6) cm for each roll. Because after the first roll, the pivot vertex changes, so the distance from the dot to the new pivot vertex might be different.Hmm, that's a good point. After the first roll, the cube is on a new face, and the pivot vertex for the next roll is a different vertex. So, the distance from the dot to the new pivot vertex might not be the same as before.Let me think about this. After the first roll, the cube has rotated 90 degrees around the initial pivot vertex, bringing a new face into contact with the surface. The dot is now on a different face, but still at the center of that face.When rolling again, the cube will pivot around a different vertex. The distance from the dot to this new pivot vertex might be different.Wait, actually, regardless of which vertex is the pivot, the dot is always at the center of the top face, which is 2 cm above the surface. So, the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex should always be the same, right?No, wait. Because after the first roll, the pivot vertex is on a different face, so the horizontal distance from the dot to the pivot vertex might change.Let me try to calculate the distance again after the first roll.After the first roll, the cube has pivoted 90 degrees around the initial vertex, so the dot is now on a different face. The new pivot vertex is adjacent to the initial one, but on the same bottom face.Wait, no. Actually, when you roll the cube over an edge, the pivot vertex is on the edge, not on the corner. Wait, no, the pivot is a vertex, not an edge. So, when rolling over an edge, the cube pivots around one of its vertices.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.When a cube rolls over an edge, it's rotating around that edge, but the problem states that during the initial roll, one vertex remains in contact with the surface. So, it's not pivoting around the edge, but around a vertex.Wait, that's different. So, the cube is rolling such that one vertex stays in contact with the surface, meaning it's rotating around that vertex.So, in this case, the cube is not rolling over an edge in the traditional sense, but rather rotating around a vertex, causing it to pivot and bring a new face into contact with the surface.This changes things. So, the cube is not rolling over an edge by rotating around that edge, but rather rotating around a vertex, which is in contact with the surface, causing the cube to pivot and bring a new face down.In this case, the pivot is a vertex, and the cube rotates around that vertex, causing the dot to move in a circular path around that vertex.So, the radius of the dot's path is the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex.Earlier, I calculated that distance as sqrt(6) cm, which seems correct.So, each time the cube rolls, it rotates 90 degrees around the pivot vertex, causing the dot to move along a quarter-circle with radius sqrt(6) cm.Therefore, each roll contributes a quarter-circle to the dot's path, and after four such rolls, the dot completes a full circle and returns to the top face.Thus, the total path length is four times the length of a quarter-circle, which is 4 * (œÄ*sqrt(6)/2) = 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.Wait, but let me double-check this. If the cube rotates 90 degrees around the pivot vertex, the dot moves along a quarter-circle. After four such rotations, it completes a full circle, returning to its original position.Yes, that makes sense. So, the total path length is 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.But wait, I'm not sure if the cube actually needs four rolls to return to the original position. Maybe it's less?Let me think about the cube's orientation after each roll. Each 90-degree rotation around a vertex changes the cube's orientation. After four such rotations, the cube would have rotated 360 degrees, bringing it back to the original orientation.But in terms of the dot's position, it needs to return to the top face. So, perhaps it takes fewer rolls?Wait, no. Because each roll moves the cube to a new face, and to return to the original face, it needs to cycle through all four adjacent faces, which would take four rolls.Yes, that seems correct. So, four rolls, each contributing a quarter-circle, totaling a full circle.Therefore, the total path length is 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.But wait, let me think again about the radius. The distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is sqrt(6) cm, so the circumference of the full circle would be 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm. Since the dot traces a full circle after four rolls, the total path length is indeed 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.Wait, but in the initial problem, the cube is rolled over its edges in a specific sequence. So, maybe the path is not a perfect circle but a series of circular arcs.But in this case, since each roll is a 90-degree rotation around a vertex, and the dot is always moving in a circular path around that vertex, the total path after four rolls would be a full circle.Therefore, the length is 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when rolling a cube, the path can be more complex, involving different radii for each roll. But in this case, since the cube is always pivoting around a vertex, and the dot is always at the center of the top face, the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex remains constant at sqrt(6) cm.Therefore, each roll contributes a quarter-circle, and four rolls make a full circle, so the total path length is 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.Wait, but let me check the calculation again. The distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is sqrt(6) cm, so the circumference is 2œÄ*sqrt(6). Since the dot traces a full circle, the length is 2œÄ*sqrt(6).Yes, that seems correct.But I recall that in some similar problems, the path length is different. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps the cube doesn't pivot around the same vertex each time, but rather around different vertices, which might change the radius of the dot's path.But in this problem, it says \\"during the initial roll, one vertex remains in contact with the surface.\\" It doesn't specify that the same vertex remains in contact for all rolls. So, perhaps after the first roll, the cube pivots around a different vertex.Wait, that complicates things. If the cube pivots around different vertices each time, the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex might change.But in reality, when rolling a cube, each subsequent roll would pivot around a different vertex, but the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex should remain the same, because the dot is always at the center of the top face, and the pivot vertex is always a corner of the bottom face.Wait, no. After the first roll, the cube is on a new face, so the pivot vertex for the next roll is a different corner, but the distance from the dot to that new pivot vertex is still sqrt(6) cm.Because the dot is always 2 cm above the surface, and the pivot vertex is always on the surface, 1 cm away from the edge on the bottom face.Wait, no. The pivot vertex is a corner of the bottom face, so the horizontal distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2) cm, and the vertical distance is 2 cm, so the total distance is sqrt(2 + 4) = sqrt(6) cm.Yes, so regardless of which vertex is the pivot, the distance from the dot to the pivot vertex is always sqrt(6) cm.Therefore, each roll contributes a quarter-circle of radius sqrt(6) cm, and four rolls make a full circle, so the total path length is 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.Wait, but I'm still a bit confused because in some references, the path length for a cube rolling around a vertex is different. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.Alternatively, perhaps the cube doesn't complete a full circle, but rather a different path.Wait, let me think about the cube's movement. Each time it rolls over a vertex, it's rotating 90 degrees, and the dot moves along a quarter-circle. After four such rolls, the cube has rotated 360 degrees, and the dot has traced a full circle.Therefore, the total path length is the circumference of that circle, which is 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm.Yes, that seems consistent.So, after all this thinking, I believe the length of the path followed by the dot is 2œÄ*sqrt(6) cm."},{"question":"Aline received a cube made of 4 times 4 times 4 small white cubes as a gift.Without separating the small cubes, Aline decided to paint all the faces of her cube with red paint.a) Determine how many small cubes have exactly one of their faces painted red.b) Determine how many small cubes have exactly two of their faces painted red.Sometime later, Aline asked her father for an even larger cube to paint in the same way she did with the previous cube.c) After completing the painting, Aline separated the small cubes. She noticed that the number of small cubes with no faces painted red was three times the number of small cubes with two faces painted red. Find the size of the new cube that Aline received.","answer":"Okay, so Aline has this cube made up of smaller white cubes, right? It's a 4x4x4 cube, which means there are 64 small cubes in total. She paints all the faces red without taking them apart. Now, I need to figure out how many small cubes have exactly one face painted and how many have exactly two faces painted.Starting with part a), which asks for the number of small cubes with exactly one face painted. Hmm, I remember that in a cube, the small cubes on the faces can have either one, two, or three faces painted, depending on their position. The ones with exactly one face painted are the ones that are on the face but not on any edge or corner. So, they're the inner cubes of each face.Since the cube is 4x4x4, each face has 4x4 = 16 small cubes. But the ones on the edges of each face are shared with adjacent faces, so they have more than one face painted. To find the cubes with exactly one face painted, I need to exclude the edges from each face.Each face is a 4x4 grid, so if I remove the outermost layer (which are the edges), the remaining inner cubes form a 2x2 grid. That's because 4 - 2 = 2 on each side. So, 2x2 = 4 small cubes per face have exactly one face painted.Since a cube has 6 faces, I multiply 4 by 6. 4x6 = 24. So, there are 24 small cubes with exactly one face painted. That should be the answer for part a).Moving on to part b), which asks for the number of small cubes with exactly two faces painted. These are the cubes that are on the edges of the larger cube but not on the corners. Each edge of the cube has small cubes, and the ones at the ends are corners, which have three faces painted. So, the cubes with exactly two faces painted are the ones in the middle of each edge.In a 4x4x4 cube, each edge has 4 small cubes. But the two at the ends are corners, so they have three faces painted. That leaves 4 - 2 = 2 small cubes per edge with exactly two faces painted.Now, how many edges does a cube have? A cube has 12 edges. So, if each edge has 2 small cubes with two faces painted, then the total number is 12x2 = 24. So, there are 24 small cubes with exactly two faces painted. That should be the answer for part b).Now, part c) is a bit more complex. Aline gets a larger cube and paints it the same way. After painting, she separates the small cubes and notices that the number of small cubes with no faces painted is three times the number of small cubes with two faces painted. I need to find the size of this new cube.Let me denote the size of the new cube as n x n x n. So, the total number of small cubes is n¬≥.First, let's figure out how many small cubes have no faces painted. These are the cubes that are completely inside the larger cube, not touching any outer face. So, they form a smaller cube of size (n-2) x (n-2) x (n-2). Therefore, the number of such cubes is (n-2)¬≥.Next, the number of small cubes with exactly two faces painted. As before, these are the cubes on the edges but not on the corners. Each edge has (n - 2) such cubes because we exclude the two corners. Since a cube has 12 edges, the total number is 12 x (n - 2).According to the problem, the number of cubes with no faces painted is three times the number of cubes with two faces painted. So, I can set up the equation:(n - 2)¬≥ = 3 x [12 x (n - 2)]Simplify the right side:(n - 2)¬≥ = 36 x (n - 2)Now, I can divide both sides by (n - 2), assuming n ‚â† 2 (which makes sense because a cube of size 2x2x2 wouldn't have any inner cubes). So, dividing both sides by (n - 2):(n - 2)¬≤ = 36Taking the square root of both sides:n - 2 = 6So, n = 8.Therefore, the size of the new cube is 8x8x8.Let me double-check my reasoning. For the number of cubes with no faces painted, (n-2)¬≥ is correct because we remove one layer from each side. For the cubes with two faces painted, it's 12 edges each contributing (n-2) cubes, which also seems right. Setting up the equation as (n-2)¬≥ = 3 x 12 x (n-2) simplifies correctly, and solving for n gives 8. That seems consistent.I think I've got it right.

Peter picks a random five-second time interval to observe the light. What is the probability that the color changes while he is watching?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total duration of the traffic light cycle. The light is green for 45 seconds, yellow for 5 seconds, blue for 10 seconds, and red for 40 seconds. Adding these together gives a total cycle time of 100 seconds.Next, I identify the points where the color changes occur:1. Green to Yellow at the 45-second mark.2. Yellow to Blue at the 50-second mark.3. Blue to Red at the 60-second mark.4. Red to Green at the 100-second mark (which is also the start of the next cycle).For Peter to witness a color change during his 5-second observation interval, he must start observing within 5 seconds before any of these transition points. This means the favorable time intervals for starting his observation are:- From 40 to 45 seconds (Green to Yellow).- From 45 to 50 seconds (Yellow to Blue).- From 55 to 60 seconds (Blue to Red).- From 95 to 100 seconds (Red to Green).Each of these intervals is 5 seconds long, and there are four such intervals. Therefore, the total favorable time is 4 multiplied by 5 seconds, which equals 20 seconds.Finally, to find the probability that Peter witnesses a color change, I divide the total favorable time by the total cycle time:[text{Probability} = frac{20}{100} = 0.20]"},{"question":"The ratio of butter:flour:sugar in a recipe is 2:3:5.

This means that for every 2 parts of butter, there are 3 parts of flour and 5 parts of sugar.Next, I know that the baker uses 6 cups of flour. Since flour corresponds to 3 parts in the ratio, I can determine the value of one part by dividing the amount of flour by the number of parts it represents:6 cups of flour √∑ 3 parts = 2 cups per part.Now that I know one part is equal to 2 cups, I can calculate the amounts of butter and sugar:- Butter: 2 parts √ó 2 cups per part = 4 cups- Sugar: 5 parts √ó 2 cups per part = 10 cupsFinally, I add up all the ingredients to find the total number of cups needed:4 cups (butter) + 6 cups (flour) + 10 cups (sugar) = 20 cups."},{"question":"On the interval [-2, 2], a number x is randomly chosen.

If b(2-cos A) = a(cos B+1) and a+c=4, then the maximum value of the area of triangle ABC is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this triangle problem here, and I need to find the maximum area of triangle ABC given some conditions. Let me try to understand and break it down step by step.First, the problem says: In triangle ABC, the angles opposite sides a, b, and c are A, B, and C respectively. We are given that b(2 - cos A) = a(cos B + 1) and a + c = 4. We need to find the maximum value of the area of triangle ABC.Alright, so let me note down the given information:1. b(2 - cos A) = a(cos B + 1)2. a + c = 4We need to find the maximum area.Hmm, okay. So, we have a relation involving sides a and b, and angles A and B. Also, we have the sum of sides a and c. Since we're dealing with triangles, maybe the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines could be helpful here.Let me recall the Law of Sines: In any triangle, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle.And the Law of Cosines: For any triangle, c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤ - 2ab cos C, and similarly for the other sides.So, maybe I can express a and b in terms of sines of their opposite angles. Let me try that.Given that a/sin A = b/sin B, so a = (b sin A)/sin B.Similarly, c = (b sin C)/sin B.But since a + c = 4, maybe I can express c in terms of a or vice versa.Wait, but let's first look at the given equation: b(2 - cos A) = a(cos B + 1)Let me substitute a from the Law of Sines into this equation.So, a = (b sin A)/sin B.Substituting into the equation:b(2 - cos A) = (b sin A / sin B)(cos B + 1)We can cancel b from both sides (assuming b ‚â† 0, which it can't be in a triangle):2 - cos A = (sin A / sin B)(cos B + 1)Hmm, okay. So, 2 - cos A = (sin A (cos B + 1))/sin BLet me write that as:2 - cos A = sin A (cos B + 1)/sin BMaybe I can manipulate this equation further.Let me denote sin B as sin B and see if I can express this in terms of angle A or B.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines on angle A or B.Wait, let me think about the sum of angles in a triangle. A + B + C = œÄ.So, C = œÄ - A - B.But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.Alternatively, maybe I can express cos A in terms of sides using the Law of Cosines.Law of Cosines for angle A: cos A = (b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤)/(2bc)Similarly, cos B = (a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤)/(2ac)But that might complicate things further. Let me see.Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of angle B, since we have a relation involving cos B and sin B.Wait, let's go back to the equation:2 - cos A = sin A (cos B + 1)/sin BLet me rearrange this equation:2 - cos A = (sin A / sin B)(cos B + 1)Let me write this as:2 - cos A = (sin A (cos B + 1))/sin BMaybe I can write sin A / sin B as a ratio from the Law of Sines, which is a/b.Wait, yes, from the Law of Sines, sin A / sin B = a / b.So, substituting that in:2 - cos A = (a / b)(cos B + 1)But from the given equation, we have b(2 - cos A) = a(cos B + 1), which is the same as:2 - cos A = (a / b)(cos B + 1)So, that's consistent.Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.Let me think about expressing cos A in terms of angle B.Since A + B + C = œÄ, and C = œÄ - A - B, maybe I can express cos A in terms of B.Alternatively, perhaps I can use some trigonometric identities.Wait, let me consider the equation again:2 - cos A = (sin A (cos B + 1))/sin BLet me write this as:2 - cos A = sin A (cos B + 1)/sin BLet me denote this as equation (1).I need to find a relationship between angles A and B.Alternatively, maybe I can express sin A in terms of sin B.Wait, from the Law of Sines, sin A / sin B = a / b.So, sin A = (a / b) sin B.Substituting into equation (1):2 - cos A = ( (a / b) sin B (cos B + 1) ) / sin BSimplify:2 - cos A = (a / b)(cos B + 1)But from the given equation, we have b(2 - cos A) = a(cos B + 1), which is the same as:2 - cos A = (a / b)(cos B + 1)So, that's consistent, but it doesn't give us new information.Hmm, maybe I need to find another equation involving a and b.We know that a + c = 4, and from the Law of Sines, c = (b sin C)/sin B.But C = œÄ - A - B, so sin C = sin(œÄ - A - B) = sin(A + B).So, c = (b sin(A + B))/sin B.Therefore, a + c = a + (b sin(A + B))/sin B = 4.But from the Law of Sines, a = (b sin A)/sin B.So, substituting a:(b sin A)/sin B + (b sin(A + B))/sin B = 4Factor out b/sin B:b/sin B [sin A + sin(A + B)] = 4Hmm, okay. Let me compute sin A + sin(A + B).Using the identity sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B.So, sin A + sin(A + B) = sin A + sin A cos B + cos A sin B= sin A (1 + cos B) + cos A sin BHmm, interesting. So, plugging back into the equation:b/sin B [sin A (1 + cos B) + cos A sin B] = 4But from equation (1), we have 2 - cos A = (a / b)(cos B + 1)Which can be rewritten as:(2 - cos A) sin B = a (cos B + 1)But a = (b sin A)/sin B, so:(2 - cos A) sin B = (b sin A / sin B)(cos B + 1)Multiply both sides by sin B:(2 - cos A) sin¬≤ B = b sin A (cos B + 1)Hmm, this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, let's go back to the equation we had earlier:b/sin B [sin A (1 + cos B) + cos A sin B] = 4Let me denote this as equation (2).From equation (1):2 - cos A = (sin A (cos B + 1))/sin BLet me solve for sin A:sin A = (2 - cos A) sin B / (cos B + 1)Let me substitute this into equation (2):b/sin B [ (2 - cos A) sin B / (cos B + 1) * (1 + cos B) + cos A sin B ] = 4Simplify:b/sin B [ (2 - cos A) sin B + cos A sin B ] = 4Factor out sin B:b/sin B [ sin B (2 - cos A + cos A) ] = 4Simplify inside the brackets:2 - cos A + cos A = 2So, we have:b/sin B [ sin B * 2 ] = 4Simplify:b * 2 = 4So, 2b = 4 => b = 2Oh, that's nice! So, we found that b = 2.Alright, so b = 2.Now, since a + c = 4, and b = 2, maybe we can express c in terms of a: c = 4 - a.So, now, we have sides a, b=2, c=4 - a.Now, let's try to find the area of the triangle.The area of a triangle can be given by (1/2)ab sin C, but in this case, maybe we can use Heron's formula or another formula.Alternatively, since we have sides a, b, c, we can use the formula:Area = (1/2) * a * c * sin BBecause sides a and c are adjacent to angle B.Wait, let me confirm: in triangle ABC, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C.So, if we consider sides a and c, the angle between them would be angle B.Yes, because in triangle ABC, sides a and c meet at angle B.So, the area can be expressed as (1/2) * a * c * sin B.So, Area = (1/2) * a * c * sin BGiven that a + c = 4, and c = 4 - a, so:Area = (1/2) * a * (4 - a) * sin BSo, Area = (1/2)(4a - a¬≤) sin BSo, Area = (2a - (a¬≤)/2) sin BHmm, okay. So, to maximize the area, we need to maximize this expression.But we also have the relation involving angles A and B from earlier.Wait, let's recall that we had:From equation (1):2 - cos A = (sin A (cos B + 1))/sin BBut since we have b = 2, and from the Law of Sines, a/sin A = b/sin B = 2/sin BSo, a = (2 sin A)/sin BSimilarly, c = (2 sin C)/sin BBut C = œÄ - A - B, so sin C = sin(A + B)So, c = (2 sin(A + B))/sin BBut since a + c = 4, we have:(2 sin A)/sin B + (2 sin(A + B))/sin B = 4Factor out 2/sin B:2/sin B [sin A + sin(A + B)] = 4Divide both sides by 2:1/sin B [sin A + sin(A + B)] = 2So, sin A + sin(A + B) = 2 sin BHmm, okay. Let's compute sin(A + B):sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin BSo, sin A + sin(A + B) = sin A + sin A cos B + cos A sin B= sin A (1 + cos B) + cos A sin BSo, we have:sin A (1 + cos B) + cos A sin B = 2 sin BLet me write this as:sin A (1 + cos B) + cos A sin B - 2 sin B = 0Hmm, maybe factor out sin B:sin A (1 + cos B) + sin B (cos A - 2) = 0Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, let's recall that from equation (1):2 - cos A = (sin A (cos B + 1))/sin BWe can write this as:2 - cos A = sin A (cos B + 1)/sin BLet me denote this as equation (3).So, from equation (3):2 - cos A = sin A (cos B + 1)/sin BLet me solve for cos A:cos A = 2 - [sin A (cos B + 1)/sin B]Hmm, okay.Now, let's recall that in triangle ABC, we have the Law of Cosines:cos A = (b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤)/(2bc)Similarly, cos B = (a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤)/(2ac)Given that b = 2, and c = 4 - a, let's substitute these into the expressions for cos A and cos B.First, compute cos A:cos A = (b¬≤ + c¬≤ - a¬≤)/(2bc) = (4 + (4 - a)¬≤ - a¬≤)/(2 * 2 * (4 - a))Simplify numerator:4 + (16 - 8a + a¬≤) - a¬≤ = 4 + 16 - 8a + a¬≤ - a¬≤ = 20 - 8aSo, cos A = (20 - 8a)/(4 * (4 - a)) = (20 - 8a)/(16 - 4a)Simplify numerator and denominator:Factor numerator: 4(5 - 2a)Denominator: 4(4 - a)So, cos A = [4(5 - 2a)]/[4(4 - a)] = (5 - 2a)/(4 - a)Similarly, compute cos B:cos B = (a¬≤ + c¬≤ - b¬≤)/(2ac) = (a¬≤ + (4 - a)¬≤ - 4)/(2a(4 - a))Simplify numerator:a¬≤ + (16 - 8a + a¬≤) - 4 = 2a¬≤ - 8a + 12So, cos B = (2a¬≤ - 8a + 12)/(2a(4 - a)) = [2(a¬≤ - 4a + 6)]/[2a(4 - a)] = (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a))Alright, so we have expressions for cos A and cos B in terms of a.Now, let's go back to equation (3):2 - cos A = sin A (cos B + 1)/sin BWe can express sin A and sin B in terms of a.From the Law of Sines:a/sin A = b/sin B = 2/sin BSo, sin A = (a sin B)/2Similarly, sin B = 2 sin A / aWait, that might not be helpful directly.Alternatively, since we have expressions for cos A and cos B, maybe we can express sin A and sin B in terms of a.We know that sin¬≤ A + cos¬≤ A = 1, so sin A = sqrt(1 - cos¬≤ A)Similarly, sin B = sqrt(1 - cos¬≤ B)But that might complicate things.Alternatively, let's express sin A / sin B from the Law of Sines:sin A / sin B = a / b = a / 2So, sin A = (a / 2) sin BSo, let's substitute sin A = (a / 2) sin B into equation (3):2 - cos A = [ (a / 2) sin B (cos B + 1) ] / sin BSimplify:2 - cos A = (a / 2)(cos B + 1)But we have expressions for cos A and cos B in terms of a.So, let's substitute cos A = (5 - 2a)/(4 - a) and cos B = (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a)) into the equation.So, 2 - [(5 - 2a)/(4 - a)] = (a / 2)[ (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a)) + 1 ]Simplify left side:2 - (5 - 2a)/(4 - a) = [2(4 - a) - (5 - 2a)] / (4 - a) = [8 - 2a - 5 + 2a] / (4 - a) = (3)/(4 - a)Right side:(a / 2)[ (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a)) + 1 ] = (a / 2)[ (a¬≤ - 4a + 6 + a(4 - a)) / (a(4 - a)) ]Simplify numerator inside the brackets:a¬≤ - 4a + 6 + 4a - a¬≤ = 6So, right side becomes:(a / 2)[ 6 / (a(4 - a)) ] = (a / 2)(6 / (a(4 - a))) = (6 / 2)(1 / (4 - a)) = 3 / (4 - a)So, left side = 3 / (4 - a), right side = 3 / (4 - a)So, both sides are equal. Hmm, that means our substitution didn't lead to a new equation, but rather confirmed the consistency.Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.Wait, since we have b = 2, and a + c = 4, and c = 4 - a, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on angle B.Law of Cosines: b¬≤ = a¬≤ + c¬≤ - 2ac cos BGiven that b = 2, a + c = 4, c = 4 - a.So, substitute:4 = a¬≤ + (4 - a)¬≤ - 2a(4 - a) cos BCompute (4 - a)¬≤:16 - 8a + a¬≤So, 4 = a¬≤ + 16 - 8a + a¬≤ - 2a(4 - a) cos BSimplify:4 = 2a¬≤ - 8a + 16 - 2a(4 - a) cos BBring all terms to one side:2a¬≤ - 8a + 16 - 4 = 2a(4 - a) cos BSimplify:2a¬≤ - 8a + 12 = 2a(4 - a) cos BDivide both sides by 2:a¬≤ - 4a + 6 = a(4 - a) cos BSo, cos B = (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a))Which is consistent with what we had earlier.Hmm, okay. So, we have expressions for cos A and cos B in terms of a.Now, let's think about the area.Area = (1/2) * a * c * sin B = (1/2) * a * (4 - a) * sin BSo, Area = (1/2)(4a - a¬≤) sin BWe need to express sin B in terms of a.From the Law of Sines, sin B = 2 sin A / aBut sin A = sqrt(1 - cos¬≤ A) = sqrt(1 - [(5 - 2a)/(4 - a)]¬≤ )Hmm, that might be messy.Alternatively, since we have cos B = (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a)), we can find sin B as sqrt(1 - cos¬≤ B)So, sin B = sqrt(1 - [(a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a))]¬≤ )But that also seems complicated.Alternatively, maybe we can express sin B in terms of a using the area formula.Wait, let's recall that the area can also be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, but I don't know if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for area in terms of sides and angles.Wait, let's think differently.We have:Area = (1/2) * a * c * sin B = (1/2) * a * (4 - a) * sin BWe need to express sin B in terms of a.From the Law of Cosines, we have cos B = (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a))So, sin B = sqrt(1 - cos¬≤ B) = sqrt(1 - [(a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a))]¬≤ )Let me compute that:Let me denote cos B = (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(a(4 - a)) = (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(4a - a¬≤)So, sin B = sqrt(1 - [(a¬≤ - 4a + 6)/(4a - a¬≤)]¬≤ )Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:1 - [(a¬≤ - 4a + 6)¬≤ / (4a - a¬≤)¬≤] = [ (4a - a¬≤)¬≤ - (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)¬≤ ] / (4a - a¬≤)¬≤Let me compute the numerator:(4a - a¬≤)¬≤ - (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)¬≤Let me expand both squares.First, (4a - a¬≤)¬≤ = ( -a¬≤ + 4a )¬≤ = a^4 - 8a^3 + 16a¬≤Second, (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)¬≤ = a^4 - 8a^3 + (16 + 12)a¬≤ - 48a + 36Wait, let me compute it step by step:(a¬≤ - 4a + 6)(a¬≤ - 4a + 6) =a¬≤*a¬≤ + a¬≤*(-4a) + a¬≤*6 + (-4a)*a¬≤ + (-4a)*(-4a) + (-4a)*6 + 6*a¬≤ + 6*(-4a) + 6*6= a^4 - 4a^3 + 6a¬≤ - 4a^3 + 16a¬≤ - 24a + 6a¬≤ - 24a + 36Combine like terms:a^4 + (-4a^3 - 4a^3) + (6a¬≤ + 16a¬≤ + 6a¬≤) + (-24a - 24a) + 36= a^4 - 8a^3 + 28a¬≤ - 48a + 36So, numerator:(4a - a¬≤)¬≤ - (a¬≤ - 4a + 6)¬≤ = (a^4 - 8a^3 + 16a¬≤) - (a^4 - 8a^3 + 28a¬≤ - 48a + 36)= a^4 - 8a^3 + 16a¬≤ - a^4 + 8a^3 - 28a¬≤ + 48a - 36Simplify:(a^4 - a^4) + (-8a^3 + 8a^3) + (16a¬≤ - 28a¬≤) + 48a - 36= 0 + 0 - 12a¬≤ + 48a - 36= -12a¬≤ + 48a - 36Factor out -12:= -12(a¬≤ - 4a + 3)Factor the quadratic:a¬≤ - 4a + 3 = (a - 1)(a - 3)So, numerator = -12(a - 1)(a - 3)Denominator = (4a - a¬≤)^2 = (a(4 - a))^2 = a¬≤(4 - a)^2So, sin B = sqrt[ -12(a - 1)(a - 3) / (a¬≤(4 - a)^2) ]Wait, but the numerator inside the square root is negative unless (a - 1)(a - 3) is negative.So, let's see when (a - 1)(a - 3) is negative.(a - 1)(a - 3) < 0 when 1 < a < 3.Since a is a side length, and a + c = 4, c = 4 - a must be positive, so a must be less than 4.Also, a must be positive, so a ‚àà (0, 4).But for (a - 1)(a - 3) < 0, a ‚àà (1, 3).So, in that interval, the numerator inside the square root is negative, but we have a negative sign outside, so overall:sin B = sqrt[ 12(a - 1)(3 - a) / (a¬≤(4 - a)^2) ]Because (a - 1)(a - 3) = -(a - 1)(3 - a)So, sin B = sqrt[ 12(a - 1)(3 - a) / (a¬≤(4 - a)^2) ]Simplify:= sqrt[12/(a¬≤(4 - a)^2) * (a - 1)(3 - a) ]= sqrt[12/(a¬≤(4 - a)^2)] * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]= [sqrt(12)/(a(4 - a))] * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]But sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so:= [2*sqrt(3)/(a(4 - a))] * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]Hmm, okay. So, sin B is expressed in terms of a.Now, going back to the area:Area = (1/2) * a * (4 - a) * sin BSubstitute sin B:= (1/2) * a * (4 - a) * [2*sqrt(3)/(a(4 - a))] * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]Simplify:= (1/2) * a * (4 - a) * [2*sqrt(3)/(a(4 - a))] * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]The a and (4 - a) terms cancel out:= (1/2) * 2*sqrt(3) * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]Simplify:= sqrt(3) * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]So, Area = sqrt(3) * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]Now, let's denote f(a) = (a - 1)(3 - a) = -a¬≤ + 4a - 3So, f(a) = -a¬≤ + 4a - 3We need to maximize sqrt(f(a)) over the interval where f(a) ‚â• 0.Since f(a) is a quadratic opening downward, its maximum occurs at the vertex.The vertex of f(a) is at a = -b/(2a) = -4/(2*(-1)) = 2So, maximum of f(a) is f(2) = -(4) + 8 - 3 = 1So, maximum of sqrt(f(a)) is sqrt(1) = 1Therefore, maximum area is sqrt(3) * 1 = sqrt(3)So, the maximum area is sqrt(3)Wait, let me confirm:We have Area = sqrt(3) * sqrt[(a - 1)(3 - a)]We need to maximize this expression. Since sqrt is an increasing function, it's equivalent to maximizing (a - 1)(3 - a).Which is a quadratic function f(a) = -a¬≤ + 4a - 3, which opens downward, so maximum at a = 2, f(2) = 1.Thus, maximum area is sqrt(3)*1 = sqrt(3)Therefore, the maximum area is sqrt(3)**Final Answer**The maximum value of the area of triangle ABC is boxed{sqrt{3}}."},{"question":"There are three schools A, B and C.

I'll take my time to think through each step carefully.**Problem 1: Calculus and Binomial Expansion**We have ( m = int_{0}^{frac{pi}{2}} sqrt{2} sin left( x + frac{pi}{4} right) dx ). I need to compute this integral first. Hmm, integrating ( sqrt{2} sin(x + frac{pi}{4}) ) from 0 to ( frac{pi}{2} ). I remember that the integral of ( sin(ax + b) ) is ( -frac{1}{a} cos(ax + b) ). So, applying that here:[m = sqrt{2} left[ -cosleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right) right]_{0}^{frac{pi}{2}}]Calculating the bounds:At ( x = frac{pi}{2} ):[-cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + frac{pi}{4}right) = -cosleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = -left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}]At ( x = 0 ):[-cosleft(0 + frac{pi}{4}right) = -cosleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}]Subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound:[frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = sqrt{2}]So, ( m = sqrt{2} times sqrt{2} = 2 ).Now, we need the coefficient of the term containing ( x ) in the expansion of ( left( sqrt{x} - frac{m}{sqrt{x}} right)^6 ). Since ( m = 2 ), this becomes ( left( sqrt{x} - frac{2}{sqrt{x}} right)^6 ).Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:[binom{6}{r} (sqrt{x})^{6 - r} left(-frac{2}{sqrt{x}}right)^r]Simplifying:[binom{6}{r} (-2)^r x^{frac{6 - r}{2} - frac{r}{2}} = binom{6}{r} (-2)^r x^{3 - r}]We want the term where the exponent of ( x ) is 1, so set ( 3 - r = 1 ) which gives ( r = 2 ).Calculating the coefficient:[binom{6}{2} (-2)^2 = 15 times 4 = 60]**Problem 2: Periodic Odd Function**Given ( f(x) ) is an odd function with period 4, and ( f(x) = 2^x - 1 ) for ( 0 < x < 2 ). We need to find ( f(-21) + f(16) ).Since the function is periodic with period 4:[f(-21) = f(-21 + 4 times 6) = f(-21 + 24) = f(3)][f(16) = f(16 - 4 times 4) = f(0)]But ( f(x) ) is odd, so ( f(-x) = -f(x) ). Also, since it's periodic, ( f(3) = f(3 - 4) = f(-1) = -f(1) ).Given ( f(x) = 2^x - 1 ) for ( 0 < x < 2 ), so ( f(1) = 2^1 - 1 = 1 ). Therefore, ( f(3) = -1 ).Also, ( f(0) = 0 ) because it's an odd function.Thus, ( f(-21) + f(16) = -1 + 0 = -1 ).**Problem 3: Probability of Teacher Assignments**We have six teachers to be assigned to three days, two each day. Teachers Wang and Li have restrictions: Wang can't be on May 2nd, Li can't be on May 3rd.Total number of ways without restrictions: ( frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90 ).Now, count the valid assignments.Case 1: Wang and Li are assigned to the same day. They can only be assigned to May 1st since Wang can't be on May 2nd and Li can't be on May 3rd.Choose 2 more teachers out of the remaining 4 for May 1st: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ).Then assign the remaining 4 teachers to May 2nd and May 3rd: ( frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 ). But since Wang and Li are already on May 1st, the assignments for the other days are unrestricted.Wait, actually, once Wang and Li are on May 1st, the remaining 4 can be assigned freely to May 2nd and May 3rd, considering the restrictions on Wang and Li are already satisfied.So total for Case 1: 6 (for May 1st) * 6 (for May 2nd and 3rd) = 36.Wait, no, actually, once Wang and Li are on May 1st, the remaining 4 can be assigned to May 2nd and May 3rd without any restrictions because Wang can't be on May 2nd, but he's already on May 1st. Similarly, Li can't be on May 3rd, but she's on May 1st. So the remaining 4 can be assigned freely.But the number of ways to assign 4 teachers into two days with two each is ( frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 ). So total for Case 1: 6 * 6 = 36.Case 2: Wang and Li are assigned to different days.Wang can be on May 1st or May 3rd. Li can be on May 1st or May 2nd.But since they must be on different days, we have:- Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd- Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1st- Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd (same as first)Wait, actually, since they are different days, we need to consider all possible pairs where Wang is on a day he's allowed and Li is on a day she's allowed, and they are different.Possible assignments:- Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd- Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1st- Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 2ndWait, but Wang can't be on May 2nd, so he can be on May 1st or May 3rd.Li can't be on May 3rd, so she can be on May 1st or May 2nd.So the possible pairs are:1. Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd2. Wang on May 1st, Li on May 1st (but they can't be on the same day in this case since we're considering different days)Wait, no, in Case 2, they are on different days.So only two possibilities:1. Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd2. Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1stWait, but if Wang is on May 3rd, Li can't be on May 3rd, so Li must be on May 1st or May 2nd. But if Wang is on May 3rd, Li can be on May 1st or May 2nd, but we need to ensure they are on different days.Wait, actually, for Case 2, we need to count all assignments where Wang and Li are on different days, considering their restrictions.So:- Wang can be on May 1st or May 3rd.- Li can be on May 1st or May 2nd.So the possible pairs where they are on different days:1. Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd2. Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1st3. Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 2ndSo three possibilities.For each possibility, we assign the remaining 4 teachers to the remaining 4 slots (since two days have one slot each already taken by Wang and Li).Wait, no. Let's think differently.Total assignments where Wang and Li are on different days:First, choose a day for Wang: 2 choices (May 1st or May 3rd).Then, choose a day for Li: if Wang is on May 1st, Li can be on May 2nd or May 3rd, but Li can't be on May 3rd, so only May 2nd. If Wang is on May 3rd, Li can be on May 1st or May 2nd.So:- If Wang is on May 1st, Li must be on May 2nd.- If Wang is on May 3rd, Li can be on May 1st or May 2nd.So total ways:- Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd: 1 way- Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1st: 1 way- Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 2nd: 1 wayTotal 3 ways.For each of these, we need to assign the remaining 4 teachers to the remaining 4 slots (since each day needs two teachers, and two are already assigned).Wait, no. Each day needs two teachers. So if Wang is on a day, we need to assign one more teacher to that day, and similarly for Li's day.So for each case:1. Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd:   - Assign one more teacher to May 1st: ( binom{4}{1} )   - Assign one more teacher to May 2nd: ( binom{3}{1} )   - The remaining two teachers go to May 3rd: ( binom{2}{2} )   - Total: ( 4 times 3 = 12 )2. Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1st:   - Assign one more teacher to May 3rd: ( binom{4}{1} )   - Assign one more teacher to May 1st: ( binom{3}{1} )   - The remaining two teachers go to May 2nd: ( binom{2}{2} )   - Total: ( 4 times 3 = 12 )3. Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 2nd:   - Assign one more teacher to May 3rd: ( binom{4}{1} )   - Assign one more teacher to May 2nd: ( binom{3}{1} )   - The remaining two teachers go to May 1st: ( binom{2}{2} )   - Total: ( 4 times 3 = 12 )So total for Case 2: 12 + 12 + 12 = 36.Wait, but earlier I thought Case 1 was 36 and Case 2 is 36, but that would make total 72, which is more than the total possible 90. That can't be right.Wait, no. Actually, in Case 1, when Wang and Li are on the same day (May 1st), we have:- Choose 2 more teachers for May 1st: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 )- Then assign the remaining 4 teachers to May 2nd and May 3rd: ( frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 )- So total for Case 1: 6 * 6 = 36In Case 2, when Wang and Li are on different days, we have 3 scenarios, each with 12 assignments, totaling 36.So total valid assignments: 36 + 36 = 72.Wait, but the total possible is 90, so the probability is 72/90 = 8/10 = 4/5. But that contradicts the initial thought.Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in counting. Let me re-examine.When Wang and Li are on the same day (May 1st):- Choose 2 more teachers for May 1st: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 )- Then assign the remaining 4 teachers to May 2nd and May 3rd: ( frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 )- Total: 6 * 6 = 36When Wang and Li are on different days:- Assign Wang to May 1st or May 3rd- Assign Li to a day she's allowed, different from Wang's dayAs above, we have 3 scenarios, each leading to 12 assignments, but actually, that's overcounting because when Wang is on May 3rd and Li on May 2nd, the remaining assignments might overlap.Wait, perhaps a better way is:Total valid assignments = total assignments without restrictions - assignments where Wang is on May 2nd or Li is on May 3rd.But inclusion-exclusion might be complicated.Alternatively, think of it as:Total valid assignments = assignments where Wang is not on May 2nd and Li is not on May 3rd.So, total assignments: 90.Subtract assignments where Wang is on May 2nd or Li is on May 3rd.But this might involve inclusion-exclusion.Number of assignments where Wang is on May 2nd: - Assign Wang to May 2nd, then assign the remaining 5 teachers to the other days, ensuring Li is not on May 3rd.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach.Wait, in the initial approach, when Wang and Li are on the same day (May 1st), we have 36 assignments.When they are on different days, we have 3 scenarios, each with 12 assignments, but actually, each scenario is unique, so total 36.Thus, total valid assignments: 36 + 36 = 72.But wait, 72 is less than 90, so the probability is 72/90 = 8/10 = 4/5. But the answer given was 7/15, which is less than 1/2. So I must have made a mistake.Wait, perhaps I overcounted. Let me think again.When Wang and Li are on the same day (May 1st):- Choose 2 more teachers for May 1st: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 )- Then assign the remaining 4 teachers to May 2nd and May 3rd: ( frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 )- Total: 6 * 6 = 36When Wang and Li are on different days:- Wang can be on May 1st or May 3rd- Li can be on May 1st or May 2nd- They must be on different daysSo:1. Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd:   - Assign Wang to May 1st, Li to May 2nd   - Assign one more teacher to May 1st: ( binom{4}{1} = 4 )   - Assign one more teacher to May 2nd: ( binom{3}{1} = 3 )   - The remaining two teachers go to May 3rd: ( binom{2}{2} = 1 )   - Total: 4 * 3 = 122. Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1st:   - Assign Wang to May 3rd, Li to May 1st   - Assign one more teacher to May 3rd: ( binom{4}{1} = 4 )   - Assign one more teacher to May 1st: ( binom{3}{1} = 3 )   - The remaining two teachers go to May 2nd: ( binom{2}{2} = 1 )   - Total: 4 * 3 = 123. Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 2nd:   - Assign Wang to May 3rd, Li to May 2nd   - Assign one more teacher to May 3rd: ( binom{4}{1} = 4 )   - Assign one more teacher to May 2nd: ( binom{3}{1} = 3 )   - The remaining two teachers go to May 1st: ( binom{2}{2} = 1 )   - Total: 4 * 3 = 12So total for Case 2: 12 + 12 + 12 = 36Thus, total valid assignments: 36 (Case 1) + 36 (Case 2) = 72But the total possible assignments are 90, so the probability is 72/90 = 8/10 = 4/5. But the answer given was 7/15, which is much less. So I must have made a mistake in counting.Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that Case 1 is 36 is incorrect. Let me re-examine.When Wang and Li are on the same day (May 1st):- Choose 2 more teachers for May 1st: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 )- Then assign the remaining 4 teachers to May 2nd and May 3rd: ( frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 )- Total: 6 * 6 = 36But wait, when assigning the remaining 4 teachers, we have to ensure that Teacher Li is not on May 3rd. But in this case, Li is already on May 1st, so the remaining assignments don't involve Li. So the 6 ways are correct.Similarly, in Case 2, when Wang and Li are on different days, the assignments are correct.But the total valid assignments are 72, so probability is 72/90 = 8/10 = 4/5. But the answer given was 7/15, which is 0.466..., which is less than 1/2. So there's a contradiction.Wait, perhaps the initial total number of assignments is incorrect. Let me recalculate.Total number of ways to assign 6 teachers into 3 days with 2 each:It's ( frac{6!}{(2!)^3} = frac{720}{8} = 90 ). That's correct.Now, valid assignments:Case 1: Wang and Li on May 1st.- Choose 2 more teachers for May 1st: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 )- Assign the remaining 4 teachers to May 2nd and May 3rd: ( frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 )- Total: 6 * 6 = 36Case 2: Wang and Li on different days.Subcases:a) Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd:- Assign Wang to May 1st, Li to May 2nd- Choose 1 more for May 1st: ( binom{4}{1} = 4 )- Choose 1 more for May 2nd: ( binom{3}{1} = 3 )- The remaining 2 go to May 3rd: 1 way- Total: 4 * 3 = 12b) Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1st:- Assign Wang to May 3rd, Li to May 1st- Choose 1 more for May 3rd: ( binom{4}{1} = 4 )- Choose 1 more for May 1st: ( binom{3}{1} = 3 )- The remaining 2 go to May 2nd: 1 way- Total: 4 * 3 = 12c) Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 2nd:- Assign Wang to May 3rd, Li to May 2nd- Choose 1 more for May 3rd: ( binom{4}{1} = 4 )- Choose 1 more for May 2nd: ( binom{3}{1} = 3 )- The remaining 2 go to May 1st: 1 way- Total: 4 * 3 = 12Total for Case 2: 12 + 12 + 12 = 36Thus, total valid assignments: 36 + 36 = 72Probability: 72/90 = 8/10 = 4/5But the answer given was 7/15, which is much less. So I must have misinterpreted the problem.Wait, the problem says \\"Teacher Wang cannot be on duty on May 2nd, and Teacher Li cannot be on duty on May 3rd.\\" So, in Case 1, when Wang and Li are on May 1st, that's fine because Wang is not on May 2nd and Li is not on May 3rd.In Case 2, when they are on different days, we have to ensure that Wang is not on May 2nd and Li is not on May 3rd.Wait, in the subcases:a) Wang on May 1st, Li on May 2nd: Li is on May 2nd, which is allowed because Li can't be on May 3rd.b) Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 1st: Wang is on May 3rd, which is allowed because Wang can't be on May 2nd.c) Wang on May 3rd, Li on May 2nd: Both are on allowed days.So all these subcases are valid.Thus, total valid assignments: 72Probability: 72/90 = 8/10 = 4/5But the answer given was 7/15, which is 0.466..., so I must have made a mistake.Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that when Wang and Li are on the same day, it's only May 1st is incorrect. Let me think.If Wang and Li are on the same day, they can be on May 1st or May 3rd? Wait, no, because Li can't be on May 3rd. So if they are on the same day, it must be May 1st.Yes, that's correct. So Case 1 is only when they are on May 1st.Thus, total valid assignments: 36 (Case 1) + 36 (Case 2) = 72Probability: 72/90 = 8/10 = 4/5But the answer given was 7/15, so I must have miscounted.Wait, perhaps the total number of valid assignments is less. Let me think differently.Total valid assignments:- Assign Wang to May 1st or May 3rd- Assign Li to May 1st or May 2nd- Ensure they are not on restricted daysLet me use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.Total assignments without restrictions: 90Subtract assignments where Wang is on May 2nd or Li is on May 3rd.Number of assignments where Wang is on May 2nd:- Assign Wang to May 2nd: 1 way- Assign the remaining 5 teachers to the other days: ( frac{5!}{2!2!1!} ) but since each day needs exactly 2, it's ( binom{5}{2} times binom{3}{2} = 10 times 3 = 30 )Similarly, number of assignments where Li is on May 3rd:- Assign Li to May 3rd: 1 way- Assign the remaining 5 teachers: ( binom{5}{2} times binom{3}{2} = 10 times 3 = 30 )But now, we have subtracted too much because assignments where both Wang is on May 2nd and Li is on May 3rd have been subtracted twice. So we need to add them back.Number of assignments where Wang is on May 2nd and Li is on May 3rd:- Assign Wang to May 2nd, Li to May 3rd- Assign the remaining 4 teachers to May 1st and the remaining slots on May 2nd and May 3rd:   - May 1st needs 2 teachers: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 )   - May 2nd already has Wang, needs 1 more: ( binom{2}{1} = 2 )   - May 3rd already has Li, needs 1 more: ( binom{1}{1} = 1 )   - Total: 6 * 2 * 1 = 12Thus, by inclusion-exclusion:Valid assignments = Total - (Wang on May 2nd + Li on May 3rd) + (both Wang on May 2nd and Li on May 3rd)= 90 - (30 + 30) + 12 = 90 - 60 + 12 = 42Thus, the number of valid assignments is 42.Therefore, the probability is 42/90 = 7/15.Ah, that makes sense now. I initially tried to count directly but made a mistake in considering the cases. Using inclusion-exclusion gives the correct count of 42 valid assignments.**Problem 4: Function Monotonicity and Zero Points**Given ( f(x) = begin{cases} x^2 + 2x - 1, & x geq a  -x^2 + 2x - 1, & x < a end{cases} )We need to find the range of ( a ) such that for any real ( b ), the equation ( f(x) = b ) has at most one solution.This means that ( f(x) ) must be strictly monotonic (either always increasing or always decreasing) over its entire domain. If ( f(x) ) is not monotonic, there could be values of ( b ) for which ( f(x) = b ) has more than one solution.Let's analyze the two pieces of ( f(x) ):1. For ( x geq a ): ( f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 1 ). This is a parabola opening upwards with vertex at ( x = -1 ).2. For ( x < a ): ( f(x) = -x^2 + 2x - 1 ). This is a parabola opening downwards with vertex at ( x = 1 ).To ensure ( f(x) ) is strictly monotonic, the function must not have any local maxima or minima that could cause it to turn around, leading to multiple solutions for some ( b ).The critical points are where the derivative changes sign.For ( x geq a ): ( f'(x) = 2x + 2 ). Setting to zero: ( 2x + 2 = 0 ) ‚Üí ( x = -1 ).For ( x < a ): ( f'(x) = -2x + 2 ). Setting to zero: ( -2x + 2 = 0 ) ‚Üí ( x = 1 ).So, the function has critical points at ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 1 ).To ensure ( f(x) ) is strictly monotonic, the point ( a ) must be chosen such that the function does not have both increasing and decreasing parts.Looking at the behavior:- For ( x geq a ), the function is increasing if ( a geq -1 ) because the vertex is at ( x = -1 ), and for ( x > -1 ), the function is increasing.- For ( x < a ), the function is increasing if ( a leq 1 ) because the vertex is at ( x = 1 ), and for ( x < 1 ), the function is increasing.Wait, no. Let me think again.For ( x geq a ), ( f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 1 ). The derivative is ( 2x + 2 ). So:- If ( a geq -1 ), then for ( x geq a geq -1 ), ( f'(x) = 2x + 2 geq 2(-1) + 2 = 0 ). So the function is non-decreasing for ( x geq a geq -1 ).- If ( a < -1 ), then for ( x geq a ), the function will have a minimum at ( x = -1 ), meaning it decreases until ( x = -1 ) and then increases.Similarly, for ( x < a ), ( f(x) = -x^2 + 2x - 1 ). The derivative is ( -2x + 2 ). Setting to zero: ( x = 1 ).- For ( x < a leq 1 ), the function is increasing because the derivative ( -2x + 2 ) is positive when ( x < 1 ).- For ( x < a > 1 ), the function would start decreasing after ( x = 1 ), but since ( a > 1 ), the function for ( x < a ) would be increasing up to ( x = 1 ) and then decreasing from ( x = 1 ) to ( x = a ). But since ( a > 1 ), this would create a local maximum at ( x = 1 ), leading to non-monotonicity.Thus, to ensure ( f(x) ) is strictly increasing (or decreasing), we need to choose ( a ) such that:- The increasing part for ( x geq a ) starts after the decreasing part of the other piece.Wait, actually, to ensure the entire function is monotonic, the point ( a ) must be chosen such that the function does not have a local maximum or minimum.Looking at the two pieces:- The right piece ( x^2 + 2x - 1 ) is increasing for ( x geq -1 ).- The left piece ( -x^2 + 2x - 1 ) is increasing for ( x leq 1 ).Thus, if we set ( a ) such that the function transitions from the left piece to the right piece at a point where both are increasing, and there's no overlap where one is increasing and the other is decreasing.Wait, more precisely, to ensure that the function is strictly increasing, we need that at ( x = a ), the left piece is less than or equal to the right piece, and both are increasing.But actually, the function must be continuous and strictly increasing.Wait, let's check continuity at ( x = a ):Left limit: ( f(a^-) = -a^2 + 2a - 1 )Right limit: ( f(a^+) = a^2 + 2a - 1 )For continuity, we need ( -a^2 + 2a - 1 = a^2 + 2a - 1 )Solving:( -a^2 + 2a - 1 = a^2 + 2a - 1 )( -a^2 = a^2 )( -2a^2 = 0 )( a^2 = 0 )( a = 0 )So, the function is continuous only at ( a = 0 ). But the problem doesn't specify continuity, just that for any ( b ), ( f(x) = b ) has at most one solution.But if ( a neq 0 ), the function will have a jump discontinuity at ( x = a ). However, even with a discontinuity, we need to ensure that the function is strictly monotonic in its domain.Wait, but if there's a jump, it could potentially allow multiple solutions for some ( b ). For example, if the function jumps up, then for values between the left limit and the right limit, there might be no solution, but for values above the right limit or below the left limit, there could be solutions. However, the problem states \\"at most one zero point,\\" meaning that for any ( b ), there is at most one ( x ) such that ( f(x) = b ).Thus, even with a discontinuity, as long as the function is strictly increasing or decreasing on each side and the jump doesn't create a situation where a horizontal line intersects both sides, it could still satisfy the condition.But to ensure that, the function must be strictly increasing on both sides, and the jump must not create a situation where a horizontal line intersects both sides.Wait, let's analyze:If ( a leq -1 ):- For ( x geq a ), since ( a leq -1 ), the right piece ( x^2 + 2x - 1 ) is increasing for ( x geq -1 ), but for ( a leq -1 ), the function on ( x geq a ) will decrease from ( x = a ) to ( x = -1 ) and then increase.This would create a local minimum at ( x = -1 ), leading to the function not being monotonic.Similarly, if ( a geq 1 ):- For ( x < a ), the left piece ( -x^2 + 2x - 1 ) is increasing for ( x leq 1 ), but for ( a geq 1 ), the function on ( x < a ) will increase up to ( x = 1 ) and then decrease from ( x = 1 ) to ( x = a ), creating a local maximum at ( x = 1 ).Thus, to avoid these local extrema, ( a ) must be chosen such that:- For the right piece ( x geq a ), ( a geq -1 ) to ensure it's increasing.- For the left piece ( x < a ), ( a leq 1 ) to ensure it's increasing.Thus, combining these, ( -1 leq a leq 1 ).Additionally, we need to ensure that at ( x = a ), the function doesn't have a jump that would allow a horizontal line to intersect both sides. However, since the function is strictly increasing on both sides within this range, and the jump (if any) would either be upwards or downwards, but as long as the function is increasing overall, it won't have multiple intersections.Wait, but if ( a ) is between -1 and 1, the function will be increasing on both sides, and the jump at ( x = a ) will either be upwards or downwards, but since both sides are increasing, the overall function will still be increasing, just with a possible jump. However, a jump could potentially cause the function to skip some values, but it won't cause multiple intersections for a single ( b ).Thus, the range of ( a ) is ( -1 leq a leq 1 ).**Final Answer**(1) boxed{60}(2) boxed{-1}(3) boxed{dfrac{7}{15}}(4) boxed{[-1, 1]}"},{"question":"Given x in mathbb{R}, f(x) is the function defined as the lesser of y = 3 - x^2 and y = 2x. The maximum value of f(x) is:A: -6B: 2C: 3D: +infty","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the maximum value of a function f(x). The function f(x) is defined as the lesser of two other functions: y = 3 - x¬≤ and y = 2x. Hmm, that means for any given x, f(x) will be whichever of those two functions is smaller. The options given are A: -6, B: 2, C: 3, and D: +‚àû. Alright, let me start by understanding what it means for f(x) to be the lesser of the two functions. So, for each x, I compare 3 - x¬≤ and 2x, and f(x) will be the smaller one. To find the maximum value of f(x), I need to figure out where this smaller value is the largest possible.First, I think it would help to graph both functions to visualize where each one is smaller. The function y = 3 - x¬≤ is a downward-opening parabola with its vertex at (0, 3). The function y = 2x is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 2. I should find the points where these two functions intersect because that's where the \\"lesser\\" function switches from one to the other. To find the intersection points, I'll set 3 - x¬≤ equal to 2x and solve for x.So, 3 - x¬≤ = 2x. Let's rearrange this equation:x¬≤ + 2x - 3 = 0.This is a quadratic equation, and I can solve it using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -3.Plugging in the values:x = [-2 ¬± ‚àö(4 + 12)] / 2x = [-2 ¬± ‚àö16] / 2x = [-2 ¬± 4] / 2So, the solutions are:x = (-2 + 4)/2 = 2/2 = 1x = (-2 - 4)/2 = -6/2 = -3Therefore, the two functions intersect at x = -3 and x = 1. That means the behavior of f(x) will change at these points.Now, I need to determine which function is smaller in different intervals. Let's consider three intervals:1. x < -32. -3 < x < 13. x > 1For each interval, I'll pick a test point to see which function is smaller.First interval: x < -3. Let's choose x = -4.Calculate y = 3 - (-4)¬≤ = 3 - 16 = -13Calculate y = 2*(-4) = -8So, between -13 and -8, the smaller value is -13. Therefore, for x < -3, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤.Second interval: -3 < x < 1. Let's choose x = 0.Calculate y = 3 - 0¬≤ = 3Calculate y = 2*0 = 0Between 3 and 0, the smaller value is 0. Therefore, for -3 < x < 1, f(x) = 2x.Third interval: x > 1. Let's choose x = 2.Calculate y = 3 - (2)¬≤ = 3 - 4 = -1Calculate y = 2*2 = 4Between -1 and 4, the smaller value is -1. Therefore, for x > 1, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤.So, summarizing:- For x < -3, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤- For -3 < x < 1, f(x) = 2x- For x > 1, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤Now, to find the maximum value of f(x), I need to analyze each interval.First interval: x < -3, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤. Since this is a downward-opening parabola, as x becomes more negative, x¬≤ increases, so 3 - x¬≤ decreases. Therefore, the maximum value in this interval occurs at x = -3. Plugging x = -3 into f(x):f(-3) = 3 - (-3)¬≤ = 3 - 9 = -6.Second interval: -3 < x < 1, f(x) = 2x. This is a straight line with a positive slope, so it increases as x increases. The maximum value in this interval occurs at x = 1. Plugging x = 1 into f(x):f(1) = 2*1 = 2.Third interval: x > 1, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤. Again, this is a downward-opening parabola. As x increases beyond 1, x¬≤ increases, so 3 - x¬≤ decreases. Therefore, the maximum value in this interval occurs at x = 1. Plugging x = 1 into f(x):f(1) = 3 - (1)¬≤ = 3 - 1 = 2.Wait a minute, that's interesting. Both the second and third intervals have a maximum value of 2 at x = 1. But let's check the value at x = 1 for both functions:From the left (x approaching 1 from below), f(x) approaches 2*1 = 2.From the right (x approaching 1 from above), f(x) approaches 3 - 1 = 2.So, f(x) is continuous at x = 1, and the value is 2.Now, let's compare the maximum values from each interval:- First interval: -6- Second interval: 2- Third interval: 2So, the maximum value of f(x) is 2.But wait, hold on. The function f(x) is defined as the lesser of the two functions. So, in the second interval, f(x) = 2x, which is increasing. Its maximum in that interval is 2 at x = 1. In the third interval, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤, which is decreasing, so its maximum is also 2 at x = 1. In the first interval, it's 3 - x¬≤, which is decreasing as x becomes more negative, so its maximum is -6 at x = -3.Therefore, the overall maximum value of f(x) is 2.But hold on again. Let me think about this. The function f(x) is the lesser of the two functions. So, in the interval -3 < x < 1, f(x) is 2x, which is increasing from -6 at x = -3 to 2 at x = 1. In the interval x > 1, f(x) is 3 - x¬≤, which is decreasing from 2 at x = 1 to negative infinity as x approaches infinity. In the interval x < -3, f(x) is 3 - x¬≤, which is decreasing from 3 at x = -3 to negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity.Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. At x = -3, f(x) is 3 - (-3)^2 = 3 - 9 = -6. But for x < -3, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤, which is a downward-opening parabola, so as x becomes more negative, x¬≤ increases, making 3 - x¬≤ decrease. So, the maximum in that interval is at x = -3, which is -6.In the interval -3 < x < 1, f(x) = 2x, which is increasing from -6 at x = -3 to 2 at x = 1.In the interval x > 1, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤, which is decreasing from 2 at x = 1 to negative infinity as x increases.So, the function f(x) has its maximum value at x = 1, where it reaches 2. But wait, is that the case?Wait, let's think about the vertex of the parabola y = 3 - x¬≤. The vertex is at (0, 3), which is higher than 2. But in the interval -3 < x < 1, f(x) is 2x, which is 0 at x = 0. So, at x = 0, f(x) is 0, which is less than 3. So, the maximum value of f(x) is not at the vertex of the parabola because in that interval, f(x) is defined as 2x, not the parabola.Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is indeed 2 at x = 1.But wait, let me double-check. If I consider the entire real line, the function f(x) is the lesser of 3 - x¬≤ and 2x. So, the maximum value of f(x) would be the highest point where f(x) is still the lesser of the two.At x = 1, both functions equal 2, so f(x) = 2. At x = 0, f(x) = 0, which is less than 2. At x = -3, f(x) = -6, which is less than 2. As x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) also approaches negative infinity.Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is indeed 2, which occurs at x = 1.But wait, hold on again. The function f(x) is the lesser of the two functions. So, in the interval -3 < x < 1, f(x) is 2x, which is increasing. So, at x = 1, f(x) reaches 2, which is the highest point in that interval. Beyond x = 1, f(x) starts decreasing again because it's now following the parabola 3 - x¬≤, which is decreasing for x > 0.So, yes, the maximum value of f(x) is 2 at x = 1.But let me think about this again. The function f(x) is the lesser of 3 - x¬≤ and 2x. So, the maximum value of f(x) is the highest point where f(x) is still the lesser of the two. So, if I look at the graph, the two functions intersect at x = -3 and x = 1. Between -3 and 1, 2x is less than 3 - x¬≤, so f(x) = 2x. Outside of that interval, 3 - x¬≤ is less than 2x, so f(x) = 3 - x¬≤.Therefore, the function f(x) is:- 3 - x¬≤ for x ‚â§ -3 and x ‚â• 1- 2x for -3 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1Now, to find the maximum value of f(x), I need to look for the highest point on the graph of f(x). In the interval -3 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1, f(x) = 2x, which is a straight line increasing from -6 at x = -3 to 2 at x = 1.In the intervals x ‚â§ -3 and x ‚â• 1, f(x) = 3 - x¬≤, which is a downward-opening parabola. For x ‚â§ -3, as x becomes more negative, f(x) decreases. For x ‚â• 1, as x increases, f(x) decreases.Therefore, the highest point on f(x) is at x = 1, where f(x) = 2.Wait, but earlier I thought about the vertex of the parabola at (0, 3). But in the interval -3 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1, f(x) is 2x, not the parabola. So, the point (0, 3) is not part of f(x) in that interval because f(x) is defined as the lesser of the two functions. At x = 0, 2x = 0, which is less than 3 - 0¬≤ = 3. Therefore, f(0) = 0, not 3.So, the maximum value of f(x) is indeed 2 at x = 1.But let me think again. If I consider the entire function f(x), it's made up of parts of the parabola and the line. The highest point on the line segment is at x = 1, which is 2. The highest point on the parabola segments is at x = -3 and x = 1, both yielding f(x) = -6 and 2 respectively. Therefore, the overall maximum is 2.Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the parabola has a vertex at (0, 3), which is higher than 2. But since in the interval around x = 0, f(x) is defined as 2x, which is lower than the parabola. So, the point (0, 3) is not part of f(x). Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is indeed 2.But let me think about this differently. Suppose I consider the maximum of f(x). Since f(x) is the lesser of two functions, its maximum can't be higher than the minimum of the maxima of the two functions. The maximum of y = 3 - x¬≤ is 3 at x = 0, and the maximum of y = 2x is unbounded as x approaches infinity. But since f(x) is the lesser of the two, its maximum can't exceed the maximum of y = 3 - x¬≤, which is 3. However, in reality, f(x) doesn't reach 3 because in the interval where the parabola is above the line, f(x) is defined as the line, which is lower.Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is 2 at x = 1.Wait, but let me check at x = 1. Both functions equal 2, so f(x) = 2. For x just less than 1, f(x) is slightly less than 2, and for x just more than 1, f(x) is slightly less than 2 as well. So, x = 1 is indeed the point where f(x) reaches its maximum value of 2.Therefore, the answer should be B: 2.But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. I thought the maximum of f(x) is 2, but the options include 3. Maybe I missed something.Wait, if I consider the point x = 0, f(x) = 0, which is less than 2. At x = 1, f(x) = 2. At x = -3, f(x) = -6. So, 2 is indeed the maximum.But hold on, let me think about the definition again. f(x) is the lesser of y = 3 - x¬≤ and y = 2x. So, for each x, f(x) is the smaller of the two y-values. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) would be the highest point where one of the functions is still smaller than the other.At x = 1, both functions are equal, so f(x) = 2. For x < 1, f(x) is 2x, which is less than 2. For x > 1, f(x) is 3 - x¬≤, which is less than 2. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is indeed 2.So, the answer is B: 2."},{"question":"Let the set S={A_0, A_1, A_2}, and define the operation oplus on S as: A_i oplus A_j = A_k, where k is the remainder of i+j divided by 3, with i, j in {1, 2, 3}. Then, the total number of ordered pairs (i, j) that satisfy the equation (A_i oplus A_j) oplus A_i = A_0 is („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: 1 pairB: 2 pairsC: 3 pairsD: 4 pairs","answer":"Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a set S = {A‚ÇÄ, A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ}, and there's an operation defined on S called ‚äï. The operation is such that when you take A_i ‚äï A_j, you get A_k, where k is the remainder when (i + j) is divided by 3. Okay, so it's like adding the indices and then taking modulo 3 to get the result.The question is asking for the number of ordered pairs (i, j) that satisfy the equation (A_i ‚äï A_j) ‚äï A_i = A‚ÇÄ. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down.First, I need to understand what the operation ‚äï does. So, if I have A_i ‚äï A_j, that's A_{(i + j) mod 3}. That means if i + j is 0 mod 3, it's A‚ÇÄ; if it's 1 mod 3, it's A‚ÇÅ; and if it's 2 mod 3, it's A‚ÇÇ. Got it.Now, the equation given is (A_i ‚äï A_j) ‚äï A_i = A‚ÇÄ. Let's parse this. First, compute A_i ‚äï A_j, which gives us A_{(i + j) mod 3}. Then, we take that result and ‚äï it with A_i again. So, that would be A_{(i + j) mod 3} ‚äï A_i, which is A_{[(i + j) mod 3 + i] mod 3}.We want this final result to be A‚ÇÄ. So, the condition is:[(i + j) mod 3 + i] mod 3 = 0.Let me write that out more clearly:[(i + j) mod 3 + i] mod 3 = 0.Hmm, maybe I can simplify this expression. Let's see. Let's denote k = (i + j) mod 3. Then, the expression becomes (k + i) mod 3 = 0. So, (k + i) ‚â° 0 mod 3. But since k = (i + j) mod 3, we can substitute back:[(i + j) mod 3 + i] mod 3 = 0.Alternatively, since (i + j) mod 3 is equivalent to (i + j - 3 * floor((i + j)/3)), but that might complicate things. Maybe it's better to think in terms of congruences.Let me rewrite the equation:[(i + j) + i] mod 3 = 0.Wait, is that right? Because (i + j) mod 3 is equivalent to (i + j) - 3 * floor((i + j)/3), but when we add i to that, we get (i + j) + i - 3 * floor((i + j)/3). Then, taking mod 3 again.But maybe instead of getting bogged down in that, I can think of it as:[(i + j) + i] mod 3 = 0.Which simplifies to:(2i + j) mod 3 = 0.Yes, that seems correct. Because (i + j) mod 3 + i mod 3 is equivalent to (i + j + i) mod 3, which is (2i + j) mod 3. So, the condition is:(2i + j) ‚â° 0 mod 3.So, we need to find all ordered pairs (i, j) where i and j are in {1, 2, 3}, such that 2i + j is divisible by 3.Wait, hold on. The original problem says i, j ‚àà {1, 2, 3}, but the set S is {A‚ÇÄ, A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ}. So, the indices go from 0 to 2, but the problem specifies i, j ‚àà {1, 2, 3}. That seems a bit confusing because 3 is not an index in S. Maybe it's a typo or maybe the indices are considered modulo 3. Let me check the original problem again.It says: \\"where k is the remainder of i + j divided by 3, with i, j ‚àà {1, 2, 3}.\\" Hmm, so i and j are from 1 to 3, but when you add them, you take modulo 3 to get k, which is 0, 1, or 2. So, A_k is in S.But in the equation, we have (A_i ‚äï A_j) ‚äï A_i = A‚ÇÄ. So, A‚ÇÄ is part of the set, but i and j are from 1 to 3.So, maybe the indices i and j are 1, 2, 3, but when we compute the operation, we take modulo 3, so effectively, they correspond to 1, 2, 0. Wait, 3 mod 3 is 0, so A‚ÇÉ would be A‚ÇÄ, but in the set S, we have A‚ÇÄ, A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ. So, perhaps when i or j is 3, it's equivalent to 0.But in the problem statement, it's specified that i, j ‚àà {1, 2, 3}, so maybe we have to consider i and j as 1, 2, or 3, but when performing operations, we take modulo 3, so 3 is treated as 0.Therefore, in the equation (A_i ‚äï A_j) ‚äï A_i = A‚ÇÄ, i and j can be 1, 2, or 3, but when we compute the operation, we take modulo 3.So, going back to the condition:(2i + j) ‚â° 0 mod 3.We need to find all ordered pairs (i, j) where i, j ‚àà {1, 2, 3} such that 2i + j is divisible by 3.Let me list all possible ordered pairs (i, j) and check which ones satisfy 2i + j ‚â° 0 mod 3.There are 3 choices for i and 3 choices for j, so 9 ordered pairs in total.Let's list them:1. (1, 1): 2*1 + 1 = 3 ‚â° 0 mod 3. So, this works.2. (1, 2): 2*1 + 2 = 4 ‚â° 1 mod 3. Doesn't work.3. (1, 3): 2*1 + 3 = 5 ‚â° 2 mod 3. Doesn't work.4. (2, 1): 2*2 + 1 = 5 ‚â° 2 mod 3. Doesn't work.5. (2, 2): 2*2 + 2 = 6 ‚â° 0 mod 3. This works.6. (2, 3): 2*2 + 3 = 7 ‚â° 1 mod 3. Doesn't work.7. (3, 1): 2*3 + 1 = 7 ‚â° 1 mod 3. Doesn't work.8. (3, 2): 2*3 + 2 = 8 ‚â° 2 mod 3. Doesn't work.9. (3, 3): 2*3 + 3 = 9 ‚â° 0 mod 3. This works.So, the pairs that satisfy the condition are (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3). That's three pairs.Wait, but in the original problem, the set S is {A‚ÇÄ, A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ}, so when i or j is 3, it's equivalent to 0. So, does that mean A‚ÇÉ is A‚ÇÄ? If so, then in the operation, when i or j is 3, it's treated as 0.But in the equation, we have (A_i ‚äï A_j) ‚äï A_i = A‚ÇÄ. So, if i is 3, then A_i is A‚ÇÄ. Let me check the pair (3,3):(A‚ÇÉ ‚äï A‚ÇÉ) ‚äï A‚ÇÉ = (A‚ÇÄ ‚äï A‚ÇÄ) ‚äï A‚ÇÄ = A‚ÇÄ ‚äï A‚ÇÄ = A‚ÇÄ. So, that works.Similarly, (1,1):(A‚ÇÅ ‚äï A‚ÇÅ) ‚äï A‚ÇÅ = (A‚ÇÇ) ‚äï A‚ÇÅ = A‚ÇÄ. Wait, let me verify that.Wait, A‚ÇÅ ‚äï A‚ÇÅ = A_{(1+1) mod 3} = A‚ÇÇ. Then, A‚ÇÇ ‚äï A‚ÇÅ = A_{(2+1) mod 3} = A‚ÇÄ. Yes, that works.Similarly, (2,2):A‚ÇÇ ‚äï A‚ÇÇ = A_{(2+2) mod 3} = A‚ÇÅ. Then, A‚ÇÅ ‚äï A‚ÇÇ = A_{(1+2) mod 3} = A‚ÇÄ. That works too.So, indeed, the pairs (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) satisfy the equation. Therefore, there are 3 such ordered pairs.But wait, in the problem statement, it says \\"the total number of ordered pairs (i, j) that satisfy the equation...\\". So, the answer should be 3 pairs, which is option C.But just to make sure, let me double-check each pair:1. (1,1): As above, works.2. (2,2): As above, works.3. (3,3): As above, works.No other pairs work because when I checked all 9 possibilities, only these three satisfy the condition.Therefore, the correct answer is C: 3 pairs."},{"question":"Given that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, 8a_3a_4-a_5^2=0, and a_2, a_4, a_6-36 form an arithmetic sequence.(1) Find the general term formula of the sequence {a_n};(2) If b_n=log_{frac{1}{2}}a_n, find the sum of the first n terms S_n of the sequence {frac{1}{b_{2n-1}b_{2n+1}}}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to understand what it's asking. First, it says that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, 8a_3a_4 - a_5¬≤ = 0. Hmm, okay. And also, a_2, a_4, a_6 - 36 form an arithmetic sequence. I need to find the general term formula of the sequence {a_n}. Then, in part (2), I have to define b_n as the logarithm base 1/2 of a_n, and find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence 1/(b_{2n-1}b_{2n+1}}). Alright, let's tackle part (1) first. Since it's a geometric sequence, I know that each term is the previous term multiplied by a common ratio, which I'll call q. So, the general term is a_n = a_1 * q^{n-1}, where a_1 is the first term.Given that 8a_3a_4 - a_5¬≤ = 0. Let me write expressions for a_3, a_4, and a_5 in terms of a_1 and q.a_3 = a_1 * q^{2}a_4 = a_1 * q^{3}a_5 = a_1 * q^{4}So, plugging these into the equation:8 * (a_1 q¬≤) * (a_1 q¬≥) - (a_1 q‚Å¥)¬≤ = 0Let me compute each part:First term: 8 * a_1 q¬≤ * a_1 q¬≥ = 8 * a_1¬≤ * q^{5}Second term: (a_1 q‚Å¥)¬≤ = a_1¬≤ * q^{8}So the equation becomes:8a_1¬≤ q‚Åµ - a_1¬≤ q‚Å∏ = 0I can factor out a_1¬≤ q‚Åµ:a_1¬≤ q‚Åµ (8 - q¬≥) = 0Since a geometric sequence can't have a zero term unless all terms are zero, which is trivial and probably not the case here. So, 8 - q¬≥ = 0, which gives q¬≥ = 8. Therefore, q = 2, since 2¬≥ = 8.Okay, so the common ratio q is 2. Now, I need to find a_1. For that, I have another condition: a_2, a_4, a_6 - 36 form an arithmetic sequence.An arithmetic sequence has a common difference, so the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, the difference between a_4 and a_2 should be equal to the difference between (a_6 - 36) and a_4.Mathematically, that means:2a_4 = a_2 + (a_6 - 36)Let me write expressions for a_2, a_4, and a_6 in terms of a_1 and q (which we know is 2):a_2 = a_1 * q^{1} = a_1 * 2a_4 = a_1 * q^{3} = a_1 * 8a_6 = a_1 * q^{5} = a_1 * 32So, plugging into the equation:2 * (a_1 * 8) = (a_1 * 2) + (a_1 * 32 - 36)Simplify each side:Left side: 16a_1Right side: 2a_1 + 32a_1 - 36 = 34a_1 - 36So, 16a_1 = 34a_1 - 36Let me subtract 16a_1 from both sides:0 = 18a_1 - 36So, 18a_1 = 36Therefore, a_1 = 36 / 18 = 2Alright, so the first term a_1 is 2, and the common ratio q is 2. Therefore, the general term is:a_n = a_1 * q^{n-1} = 2 * 2^{n-1} = 2^{n}So, a_n = 2^n. That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to part (2). It says: If b_n = log_{1/2} a_n, find the sum of the first n terms S_n of the sequence {1/(b_{2n-1}b_{2n+1})}.First, let me find b_n. Since b_n is the logarithm base 1/2 of a_n, and a_n is 2^n.So, b_n = log_{1/2} (2^n)I know that log_{1/2} (2^n) can be rewritten using change of base formula or by recognizing that (1/2)^k = 2^{-k}. So, log_{1/2} (2^n) = log_{2^{-1}} (2^n) = (-1) * log_2 (2^n) = (-1) * n = -n.So, b_n = -n.Therefore, b_{2n-1} = -(2n - 1) and b_{2n+1} = -(2n + 1).So, 1/(b_{2n-1}b_{2n+1}) = 1/[ (-(2n - 1)) * (-(2n + 1)) ] = 1/[ (2n - 1)(2n + 1) ]Because multiplying two negatives gives a positive.So, the term is 1/( (2n - 1)(2n + 1) ). I need to find the sum of the first n terms of this sequence. So, S_n = sum_{k=1}^{n} [1/( (2k - 1)(2k + 1) ) ]This looks like a telescoping series. Maybe I can use partial fractions to decompose 1/( (2k - 1)(2k + 1) ).Let me set up partial fractions:1/( (2k - 1)(2k + 1) ) = A/(2k - 1) + B/(2k + 1)Multiply both sides by (2k - 1)(2k + 1):1 = A(2k + 1) + B(2k - 1)Let me solve for A and B.Expanding the right side:1 = (2A + 2B)k + (A - B)Since this must hold for all k, the coefficients of k and the constant term must be equal on both sides.Coefficient of k: 2A + 2B = 0Constant term: A - B = 1So, from the first equation: 2A + 2B = 0 => A + B = 0 => A = -BFrom the second equation: A - B = 1Substitute A = -B into the second equation:(-B) - B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2Then, A = -B = 1/2So, the partial fractions decomposition is:1/( (2k - 1)(2k + 1) ) = (1/2)/(2k - 1) + (-1/2)/(2k + 1) = (1/2)[1/(2k - 1) - 1/(2k + 1)]Therefore, each term in the sum S_n is (1/2)[1/(2k - 1) - 1/(2k + 1)]So, S_n = sum_{k=1}^{n} (1/2)[1/(2k - 1) - 1/(2k + 1)] = (1/2) sum_{k=1}^{n} [1/(2k - 1) - 1/(2k + 1)]Let me write out the terms of the sum to see the telescoping effect.When k = 1: [1/1 - 1/3]When k = 2: [1/3 - 1/5]When k = 3: [1/5 - 1/7]...When k = n: [1/(2n - 1) - 1/(2n + 1)]So, when we add all these up, most terms cancel out. The -1/3 from the first term cancels with the +1/3 from the second term. Similarly, -1/5 cancels with +1/5, and so on, up until -1/(2n - 1) cancels with the previous term's +1/(2n - 1). What's left is the first term of the first expression, which is 1/1, and the last term of the last expression, which is -1/(2n + 1). So, the sum becomes:(1/2)[1 - 1/(2n + 1)]Simplify this:(1/2)[ (2n + 1)/(2n + 1) - 1/(2n + 1) ) ] = (1/2)[ (2n + 1 - 1)/(2n + 1) ) ] = (1/2)[ 2n / (2n + 1) ) ] = (1/2)*(2n)/(2n + 1) = n / (2n + 1)So, the sum S_n is n / (2n + 1).Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Found that q = 2 and a_1 = 2, so a_n = 2^n. That seems correct.2. For b_n, since a_n = 2^n, log base 1/2 of 2^n is indeed -n. So, b_n = -n.3. Then, 1/(b_{2n-1}b_{2n+1}) becomes 1/[(2n - 1)(2n + 1)].4. Partial fractions decomposition gave me (1/2)[1/(2k - 1) - 1/(2k + 1)], which seems correct.5. Summing from k=1 to n, the telescoping leaves 1 - 1/(2n + 1), multiplied by 1/2, resulting in n/(2n + 1). That seems correct.I think that's solid. So, the final answer for part (1) is a_n = 2^n, and for part (2), the sum S_n is n/(2n + 1).**Final Answer**(1) The general term formula is boxed{2^n}.(2) The sum of the first ( n ) terms is boxed{dfrac{n}{2n + 1}}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)= frac{1}{{2}^{x}+1}, then f({log }_{3}2)+f({log }_{3} frac{1}{2}) __________.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this function f(x) = 1/(2^x + 1), and I need to find f(log‚ÇÉ2) + f(log‚ÇÉ(1/2)). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that logarithms have some properties that might help here. Specifically, log‚ÇÉ(1/2) can be rewritten using the logarithm of a reciprocal. I think it's something like log‚ÇÉ(1/2) = -log‚ÇÉ2. Let me verify that: yes, because log_b(1/a) = -log_b(a). So, log‚ÇÉ(1/2) is indeed -log‚ÇÉ2. That seems useful because now I can express both terms in terms of log‚ÇÉ2.Let me denote t = log‚ÇÉ2. Then, log‚ÇÉ(1/2) = -t. So, now the expression becomes f(t) + f(-t). That simplifies the problem a bit because I can now focus on evaluating f(t) + f(-t).Given f(x) = 1/(2^x + 1), let's compute f(t) and f(-t):f(t) = 1/(2^t + 1)f(-t) = 1/(2^{-t} + 1)Hmm, 2^{-t} is the same as 1/(2^t). So, f(-t) can be rewritten as 1/(1/(2^t) + 1). Let me simplify that:f(-t) = 1/(1/(2^t) + 1) = 1/((1 + 2^t)/2^t) = 2^t / (1 + 2^t)So now, f(t) = 1/(2^t + 1) and f(-t) = 2^t/(2^t + 1). If I add these two together:f(t) + f(-t) = [1/(2^t + 1)] + [2^t/(2^t + 1)] = (1 + 2^t)/(2^t + 1) = 1Oh, that's neat! The sum simplifies to 1. So, regardless of the value of t, f(t) + f(-t) is always 1. That means f(log‚ÇÉ2) + f(log‚ÇÉ(1/2)) = 1.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, starting from f(x) = 1/(2^x + 1), then f(-x) = 1/(2^{-x} + 1) = 2^x/(1 + 2^x). Adding them together:1/(2^x + 1) + 2^x/(2^x + 1) = (1 + 2^x)/(2^x + 1) = 1. Yep, that seems correct.So, substituting x with log‚ÇÉ2, we get the same result. Therefore, the sum is indeed 1.I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. The key was recognizing the relationship between log‚ÇÉ2 and log‚ÇÉ(1/2), expressing both terms in terms of t, and then using the properties of the function f(x) to find that their sum is 1.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(log_{3}2) + f(log_{3} frac{1}{2}) ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"In how many ways can 525 be written as the sum of an increasing sequence of two or more consecutive positive integers?textbf{(A)} 2qquadtextbf{(B)} 5qquadtextbf{(C)} 6qquadtextbf{(D)} 7qquadtextbf{(E)} 9","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem: \\"In how many ways can 525 be written as the sum of an increasing sequence of two or more consecutive positive integers?\\" The options are A) 2, B) 5, C) 6, D) 7, E) 9. Hmm, okay. I remember that expressing a number as a sum of consecutive integers has something to do with factors and divisors. Let me try to recall the formula or method for this.I think the formula for the sum of consecutive integers starting from 'n' and having 'k' terms is something like:[ text{Sum} = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + ldots + (n+k-1) ]Which simplifies to:[ text{Sum} = k cdot n + frac{k(k-1)}{2} ]So, in this case, the sum is 525. Therefore:[ k cdot n + frac{k(k-1)}{2} = 525 ]Let me rearrange this equation to solve for 'n':[ k cdot n = 525 - frac{k(k-1)}{2} ][ n = frac{525 - frac{k(k-1)}{2}}{k} ][ n = frac{525}{k} - frac{k-1}{2} ]Okay, so for 'n' to be a positive integer, both terms on the right must result in an integer. That means (frac{525}{k}) must be an integer, so 'k' must be a divisor of 525. Also, (frac{k-1}{2}) must be an integer, which implies that 'k' must be odd or 'k' must be 2 because if 'k' is even, then (frac{k-1}{2}) would not be an integer.Wait, let me think about that again. If 'k' is even, then (k-1) is odd, so (frac{k-1}{2}) would not be an integer. So, for (frac{k-1}{2}) to be an integer, 'k' must be odd because then (k-1) is even, making the division result in an integer. Alternatively, if 'k' is 2, then (frac{2-1}{2} = 0.5), which is not an integer. Hmm, so maybe 'k' must be odd? Because if 'k' is 2, then 'n' would be:[ n = frac{525}{2} - frac{1}{2} = 262.5 - 0.5 = 262 ]Wait, 262 is an integer. So, even though (frac{k-1}{2}) is 0.5, when subtracted from 262.5, it gives an integer. So, maybe 'k' can be 2 as well. Hmm, so perhaps 'k' can be either odd or 2? Let me check.If 'k' is 2, then:[ n = frac{525}{2} - frac{1}{2} = 262.5 - 0.5 = 262 ]Which is an integer, so that works. If 'k' is 3:[ n = frac{525}{3} - frac{2}{2} = 175 - 1 = 174 ]That's also an integer. Similarly, for 'k' = 5:[ n = frac{525}{5} - frac{4}{2} = 105 - 2 = 103 ]Also an integer. So, it seems that 'k' can be either odd or 2. So, I need to find all divisors of 525, both odd and 2, and check if they satisfy the condition that 'n' is positive.First, let's factorize 525 to find all its divisors. 525 divided by 5 is 105. 105 divided by 5 is 21. 21 is 3 times 7. So, the prime factors are 3, 5, 5, 7. So, the prime factorization is (3 times 5^2 times 7).The number of divisors is calculated by adding 1 to each exponent and multiplying: (1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 2*3*2 = 12. So, there are 12 divisors. Let's list them:1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 25, 35, 75, 105, 175, 525.Now, we need to consider 'k' as each of these divisors, but 'k' must be at least 2 because the problem says \\"two or more consecutive positive integers.\\" So, we exclude 1. Also, as we discussed earlier, 'k' must be either odd or 2. So, from the list, the possible 'k's are:2, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 25, 35, 75, 105, 175, 525.Wait, but 2 is even, but as we saw earlier, it still works because when 'k' is 2, 'n' is an integer. So, let's include 2 as a possible 'k'.Now, for each 'k', we need to compute 'n' and check if it's a positive integer. Let's go through each 'k':1. k = 2:[ n = frac{525}{2} - frac{1}{2} = 262.5 - 0.5 = 262 ]Which is positive and integer. So, this is valid.2. k = 3:[ n = frac{525}{3} - frac{2}{2} = 175 - 1 = 174 ]Positive integer. Valid.3. k = 5:[ n = frac{525}{5} - frac{4}{2} = 105 - 2 = 103 ]Positive integer. Valid.4. k = 7:[ n = frac{525}{7} - frac{6}{2} = 75 - 3 = 72 ]Positive integer. Valid.5. k = 15:[ n = frac{525}{15} - frac{14}{2} = 35 - 7 = 28 ]Positive integer. Valid.6. k = 21:[ n = frac{525}{21} - frac{20}{2} = 25 - 10 = 15 ]Positive integer. Valid.7. k = 25:[ n = frac{525}{25} - frac{24}{2} = 21 - 12 = 9 ]Positive integer. Valid.8. k = 35:[ n = frac{525}{35} - frac{34}{2} = 15 - 17 = -2 ]Negative. Not valid.9. k = 75:[ n = frac{525}{75} - frac{74}{2} = 7 - 37 = -30 ]Negative. Not valid.10. k = 105:[ n = frac{525}{105} - frac{104}{2} = 5 - 52 = -47 ]Negative. Not valid.11. k = 175:[ n = frac{525}{175} - frac{174}{2} = 3 - 87 = -84 ]Negative. Not valid.12. k = 525:[ n = frac{525}{525} - frac{524}{2} = 1 - 262 = -261 ]Negative. Not valid.So, from the above, the valid 'k's are 2, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 25. Wait, that's 7 values. But wait, when k=25, n=9, which is positive. So, that's valid. So, that's 7 ways. But let me check the options: A)2, B)5, C)6, D)7, E)9.So, D)7 is an option. But wait, in the initial problem, it's \\"two or more consecutive positive integers.\\" So, k=2 is allowed. But in the calculation above, k=25 gives n=9, which is positive. So, that's valid.But wait, let me double-check. When k=25, n=9, so the sequence is 9,10,...,33. Let's check the sum:Sum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term) = 25/2 * (9 + 33) = 25/2 * 42 = 25*21 = 525. Correct.Similarly, for k=35, n=-2, which is invalid because we need positive integers. So, only up to k=25 is valid.So, the valid k's are 2,3,5,7,15,21,25. That's 7 ways. So, the answer should be D)7.Wait, but in the initial thought process, I thought the answer was 5, but now I'm getting 7. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.Wait, let me recount:k=2: validk=3: validk=5: validk=7: validk=15: validk=21: validk=25: validThat's 7. So, why did I initially think 5? Maybe I missed some divisors.Wait, in the initial thought process, I considered k=3,5,7,15,21, but not k=2 and k=25. So, that's why I got 5, but actually, k=2 and k=25 are also valid. So, the correct number is 7.But wait, let me check the problem statement again: \\"two or more consecutive positive integers.\\" So, k=2 is allowed, and k=25 is allowed as well. So, 7 ways.But the options include D)7, so that should be the answer.Wait, but in the initial thought process, I thought k=2 was invalid because n would be 262.5 - 0.5 = 262, which is integer, so it's valid. So, k=2 is valid.Similarly, k=25 gives n=9, which is positive integer.So, total valid k's: 2,3,5,7,15,21,25. That's 7.Therefore, the answer is D)7.But wait, the initial thought process in the problem statement said the answer was B)5. So, maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let me check the calculation for k=25 again:n = 525/25 - (25-1)/2 = 21 - 12 = 9. Correct.Similarly, for k=35: n=15 -17=-2, invalid.So, 7 valid k's.But perhaps the problem is that when k=25, the sequence starts at 9 and ends at 9+24=33, which is fine.Similarly, k=2: starts at 262, ends at 263.So, 7 ways.But the options are A)2, B)5, C)6, D)7, E)9.So, D)7 is correct.Wait, but in the initial thought process, I thought the answer was 5, but now I'm getting 7.

That's 7.Therefore, the correct answer is D)7.So, the initial thought process was incorrect because it didn't consider k=2 and k=25 as valid, but they are.Therefore, the correct answer is D)7."},{"question":"Suppose that the roots of x^3+2x^2+5x-8=0 are a, b, and c, and that the roots of x^3+px^2+qx+u=0 are a+b, b+c, and c+a. Find u.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a cubic equation, and I need to find the value of 'u' in another cubic equation whose roots are related to the original one. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the original equation is ( x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x - 8 = 0 ), and its roots are ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). The new equation is ( x^3 + px^2 + qx + u = 0 ), and its roots are ( a+b ), ( b+c ), and ( c+a ). I need to find the value of ( u ).I remember from Vieta's formulas that for a cubic equation ( x^3 + mx^2 + nx + p = 0 ), the sum of the roots is ( -m ), the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is ( n ), and the product of the roots is ( -p ).So, applying Vieta's formulas to the original equation:1. ( a + b + c = -2 ) (since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is 2)2. ( ab + ac + bc = 5 ) (since the coefficient of ( x ) is 5)3. ( abc = 8 ) (since the constant term is -8)Now, for the new equation with roots ( a+b ), ( b+c ), and ( c+a ), I need to find ( u ), which is the negative of the product of the roots. So, ( u = - (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) ).Hmm, so I need to compute ( (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) ). Let me see how I can express this in terms of ( a + b + c ), ( ab + ac + bc ), and ( abc ), which I already know from the original equation.I recall that ( (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) ) can be expanded. Let me try expanding it step by step.First, let me consider ( (a+b)(b+c) ):( (a+b)(b+c) = ab + a c + b^2 + bc )Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it properly:( (a+b)(b+c) = a cdot b + a cdot c + b cdot b + b cdot c = ab + ac + b^2 + bc )But actually, that's not the standard expansion. Wait, no, actually, the standard expansion is:( (a + b)(b + c) = ab + a c + b^2 + bc ). Hmm, but that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.Alternatively, I remember that ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc ). Is that correct? Let me verify.Let me expand ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ):First, multiply ( (a + b)(b + c) ):( (a + b)(b + c) = ab + a c + b^2 + bc )Now, multiply this by ( (c + a) ):So, ( (ab + ac + b^2 + bc)(c + a) )Let me distribute each term:1. ( ab cdot c = abc )2. ( ab cdot a = a^2 b )3. ( ac cdot c = a c^2 )4. ( ac cdot a = a^2 c )5. ( b^2 cdot c = b^2 c )6. ( b^2 cdot a = a b^2 )7. ( bc cdot c = b c^2 )8. ( bc cdot a = a b c )So, combining all these terms:( abc + a^2 b + a c^2 + a^2 c + b^2 c + a b^2 + b c^2 + abc )Combine like terms:- ( abc + abc = 2abc )- ( a^2 b + a b^2 = ab(a + b) )- ( a^2 c + a c^2 = ac(a + c) )- ( b^2 c + b c^2 = bc(b + c) )Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.Wait, I remember that ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc ). Let me check if that's true.Let me compute the right-hand side:( (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca) )Which is:( a^2 b + a b c + a c a + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c a + a c b + b c^2 + c^2 a )Wait, that seems similar to the expansion above. Let me see:Wait, no, actually, ( (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) ) expands to:( a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca) )Which simplifies to:( a^2 b + a b c + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c a + a b c + b c^2 + c^2 a )Wait, that's:( a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + a c^2 + b c^2 + 3 a b c )But in our earlier expansion of ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ), we had:( 2abc + a^2 b + a b^2 + a^2 c + a c^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 )So, comparing both:( (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + a c^2 + b c^2 + 3 a b c )And ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + a c^2 + b c^2 + 2 a b c )Therefore, ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc )Yes, that's correct because:( (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc = (a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + a c^2 + b c^2 + 3 a b c) - abc = a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + a c^2 + b c^2 + 2 a b c ), which matches the expansion of ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ).So, that formula is correct.Therefore, ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc ).Great, so now I can plug in the known values from the original equation.From the original equation:- ( a + b + c = -2 )- ( ab + bc + ca = 5 )- ( abc = 8 )So, plugging these into the formula:( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (-2)(5) - 8 = -10 - 8 = -18 )Therefore, ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = -18 )But wait, in the new equation, ( u = - (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ), so:( u = - (-18) = 18 )So, the value of ( u ) is 18.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I used Vieta's formulas correctly for the original equation.2. I correctly identified the formula for ( (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ) in terms of ( a + b + c ), ( ab + bc + ca ), and ( abc ).3. Plugged in the values: (-2)(5) = -10, then -10 - 8 = -18.4. Then, since ( u = - (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ), which is -(-18) = 18.Everything seems to check out. So, I think 18 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( u ) is boxed{18}."},{"question":"Call a positive integer ( N geq 2 ) \\"special\\" if for every ( k ) such that ( 2 leq k leq N ), ( N ) can be expressed as a sum of ( k ) positive integers that are relatively prime to ( N ) (although not necessarily relatively prime to each other).

So, for example, if ( N = 5 ), I need to check if 5 can be expressed as the sum of 2, 3, 4, and 5 numbers, each relatively prime to 5.Let's try ( k = 2 ). Can 5 be expressed as the sum of two numbers relatively prime to 5? Well, 5 can be 1 + 4. Both 1 and 4 are relatively prime to 5. So that works.For ( k = 3 ), 5 can be 1 + 1 + 3. Again, 1 and 3 are relatively prime to 5. Similarly, for ( k = 4 ), it's 1 + 1 + 1 + 2. All these numbers are relatively prime to 5. And for ( k = 5 ), it's just five 1s. So, 5 is a special number.Alright, so 5 is special. Let's try another number, say 6.For ( k = 2 ), can 6 be expressed as the sum of two numbers relatively prime to 6? Let's see. 6 can be 1 + 5. Both 1 and 5 are relatively prime to 6. Good.For ( k = 3 ), 6 can be 1 + 1 + 4. 1 and 4 are relatively prime to 6. Wait, 4 and 6 have a common divisor of 2, so 4 is not relatively prime to 6. Oops, that doesn't work. Let me try another combination. How about 1 + 2 + 3? 2 and 3 are not relatively prime to 6 either. Hmm, 1 + 5 + 0? Wait, 0 isn't positive. Maybe 3 + 3 + 0? No, same issue. It seems challenging.Wait, maybe I need to use more 1s. Let's try 1 + 1 + 4 again. But 4 isn't relatively prime to 6. Maybe 1 + 5 + 0, but again, 0 isn't allowed. Is there a way to express 6 as the sum of three numbers, each relatively prime to 6? Let's think differently.What if I use 1 + 1 + 4? As before, 4 isn't coprime with 6. 1 + 2 + 3? 2 and 3 aren't coprime with 6. 5 + 1 + 0? No. Maybe 3 + 3 + 0? No. Hmm, is it possible? Maybe not. So, 6 might not be a special number.Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe using more 1s and another number. For example, 1 + 1 + 4, but 4 isn't coprime. 1 + 5 + 0, but 0 isn't allowed. Maybe 5 + 1 + 0? No. It seems like it's not possible. So, 6 might not be special.Okay, so 5 is special, 6 might not be. Let's try 7.For ( k = 2 ), 7 can be 1 + 6. Both 1 and 6 are relatively prime to 7. Good.For ( k = 3 ), 7 can be 1 + 1 + 5. 1 and 5 are relatively prime to 7. Similarly, for ( k = 4 ), it's 1 + 1 + 1 + 4. 1 and 4 are relatively prime to 7. For ( k = 5 ), 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3. All numbers are relatively prime to 7. For ( k = 6 ), 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2. All numbers are relatively prime to 7. And for ( k = 7 ), seven 1s. So, 7 is special.Interesting. So, 5 and 7 are special, but 6 might not be. Let's see if there's a pattern here.Looking back at the examples, it seems that odd numbers might have an advantage here because even numbers have more restrictions. For example, 6 is even, and when trying to express it as a sum of numbers relatively prime to it, we ran into issues because even numbers share a common factor with 6.Wait, let's think about this. If ( N ) is even, then any number relatively prime to ( N ) must be odd because even numbers would share a factor of 2 with ( N ). So, if ( N ) is even, all the summands must be odd.But here's the catch: the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, and the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even. So, if ( N ) is even, and we're trying to express it as a sum of ( k ) odd numbers, ( k ) must be even because ( N ) is even. But in our problem, ( k ) can be any number from 2 up to ( N ), including both even and odd ( k ).So, for example, if ( N = 6 ), and ( k = 3 ), we need to express 6 as the sum of 3 odd numbers. But 3 odd numbers add up to an odd number, and 6 is even. That's impossible. Therefore, 6 cannot be expressed as the sum of 3 numbers relatively prime to it because all such numbers would have to be odd, and their sum would be odd, which doesn't equal 6.Therefore, any even ( N ) greater than 2 cannot be special because for ( k = 3 ), it's impossible to express ( N ) as the sum of 3 numbers relatively prime to it. Wait, but what about ( N = 2 )? Let's check.For ( N = 2 ), ( k ) can only be 2. So, we need to express 2 as the sum of 2 numbers relatively prime to 2. The only positive integers that are relatively prime to 2 are odd numbers. So, 1 and 1. 1 + 1 = 2. Both 1s are relatively prime to 2. So, 2 is special.So, 2 is special, but any other even number greater than 2 is not special. That's an important observation.Now, let's focus on odd numbers. For an odd ( N ), numbers relatively prime to ( N ) can be both even and odd because ( N ) doesn't have 2 as a factor. So, we have more flexibility in choosing summands.Let me take ( N = 9 ) as an example.For ( k = 2 ), 9 can be 1 + 8. Both 1 and 8 are relatively prime to 9.For ( k = 3 ), 9 can be 1 + 1 + 7. All numbers are relatively prime to 9.For ( k = 4 ), 9 can be 1 + 1 + 1 + 6. 1 and 6 are relatively prime to 9.For ( k = 5 ), 9 can be 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5. All numbers are relatively prime to 9.For ( k = 6 ), 9 can be 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4. All numbers are relatively prime to 9.For ( k = 7 ), 9 can be 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3. All numbers are relatively prime to 9.For ( k = 8 ), 9 can be 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2. All numbers are relatively prime to 9.And for ( k = 9 ), nine 1s. So, 9 is special.This seems to work for odd numbers. Let me test another odd number, say 15.For ( k = 2 ), 15 = 1 + 14. Both are relatively prime to 15.For ( k = 3 ), 15 = 1 + 1 + 13. All are relatively prime to 15.For ( k = 4 ), 15 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 12. All are relatively prime to 15.Continuing this way, it seems that for any odd ( N ), we can always express it as a sum of ( k ) numbers relatively prime to ( N ) by using a bunch of 1s and adjusting the last number accordingly.Wait, but is there a case where this might not work? Let's think about ( N = 1 ). But ( N geq 2 ), so we're fine.What about ( N = 1 )? Not applicable here.Wait, another thought: if ( N ) is a prime number, then all numbers less than ( N ) are relatively prime to it. So, expressing ( N ) as a sum of ( k ) numbers relatively prime to ( N ) is even easier because we can use 1s and other numbers.But even if ( N ) is composite, as long as it's odd, we can still use 1s and adjust the last number to be relatively prime. For example, ( N = 15 ) is composite, but as shown earlier, it's still special.So, it seems that all odd numbers ( N geq 2 ) are special, and the only even number that is special is 2.Now, let's count how many special numbers there are less than 100.First, list all odd numbers from 3 up to 99. How many are there?From 3 to 99 inclusive, stepping by 2: (99 - 3)/2 + 1 = (96)/2 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 numbers.Plus the number 2, which is special.So, total special numbers less than 100 are 49 + 1 = 50.Wait, but let me double-check. Are all odd numbers indeed special? Is there any odd number that might not be special?Let me think about ( N = 1 ). But ( N geq 2 ), so we're okay.What about ( N = 9 )? We saw it's special.What about ( N = 15 )? Also special.What about ( N = 21 )? Let's check.For ( k = 2 ), 21 = 1 + 20. Both are relatively prime to 21.For ( k = 3 ), 21 = 1 + 1 + 19. All are relatively prime to 21.For ( k = 4 ), 21 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 18. All are relatively prime to 21.And so on, up to ( k = 21 ). It seems to work.What about ( N = 25 )?For ( k = 2 ), 25 = 1 + 24. Both are relatively prime to 25.For ( k = 3 ), 25 = 1 + 1 + 23. All are relatively prime to 25.And so on. It seems consistent.Therefore, my conclusion is that all odd numbers ( N geq 2 ) are special, and the only even number that is special is 2. Hence, the total number of special integers less than 100 is 50."},{"question":"two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 18 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post . if the length of each train be 120 m , in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction ?","answer":"First, I need to determine the speeds of both trains.

After passing point ( O ), each continues to move along their respective lines. The distances ( A O = 120 ) meters and ( B O = 80 ) meters, and the angle (angle A O B = 60^circ). The squirrels move at the same constant speed. What is the minimum distance between the squirrels during their movement?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two squirrels starting at points A and B, moving towards point O along lines AO and BO respectively. After passing O, they continue moving along those lines. The distances AO is 120 meters, BO is 80 meters, and the angle between AO and BO is 60 degrees. Both squirrels move at the same constant speed. I need to find the minimum distance between them during their movement.Hmm, let me try to visualize this. Points A and B are connected through point O with a 60-degree angle between them. The squirrels start moving towards O at the same time and same speed. After passing O, they keep going along their respective lines. So, their paths are straight lines passing through O.I think it might help to draw a diagram. Let me sketch points A, O, and B with AO = 120, BO = 80, and angle AOB = 60 degrees. The squirrels start at A and B, moving towards O. After passing O, they continue in the same direction.Since both squirrels move at the same speed, the distance each has traveled from their starting points at any time t will be the same. Let's denote this distance as d. So, at time t, the squirrel from A will be at a point E on AO such that AE = d, and the squirrel from B will be at a point F on BO such that BF = d.Wait, but after passing O, they continue moving. So, if d is greater than AO or BO, they would have passed O and are moving beyond it. So, maybe I need to consider two cases: before passing O and after passing O.But actually, since they start at the same time and move at the same speed, the distance from their starting points is the same at any time. So, when d is less than AO and BO, they are moving towards O. When d is greater than AO or BO, they have passed O and are moving beyond.But since AO is 120 and BO is 80, the squirrel starting at B will reach O faster. Specifically, the time it takes for the squirrel from B to reach O is t1 = BO / speed = 80 / v, and for the squirrel from A, it's t2 = AO / speed = 120 / v. So, the squirrel from B reaches O first.After that, the squirrel from B continues moving beyond O, while the squirrel from A is still moving towards O until it reaches O at t2. After t2, both squirrels are moving beyond O along their respective lines.So, the motion can be divided into three intervals:1. From t = 0 to t = t1: Both squirrels are moving towards O, with the squirrel from B getting closer to O faster.2. From t = t1 to t = t2: The squirrel from B has passed O and is moving beyond, while the squirrel from A is still moving towards O.3. After t = t2: Both squirrels have passed O and are moving beyond along their respective lines.I need to find the minimum distance between the two squirrels during all these intervals.Maybe I can model the positions of the squirrels as functions of time and then find the minimum distance.Let me denote the position of the squirrel from A as E(t) and from B as F(t). Since they move at the same speed, let's denote their speed as v. Then, the distance each has traveled from their starting points at time t is d(t) = v * t.So, the position of E(t) is along AO, and the position of F(t) is along BO.But since AO and BO are straight lines with an angle of 60 degrees between them, I can model this in a coordinate system.Let me place point O at the origin (0,0). Let me align AO along the x-axis. So, point A is at (120, 0). Point B is at a position making a 60-degree angle with AO. So, coordinates of B can be found using trigonometry.The coordinates of B would be (BO * cos(60¬∞), BO * sin(60¬∞)) = (80 * 0.5, 80 * (‚àö3)/2) = (40, 40‚àö3).So, point A is at (120, 0), point B is at (40, 40‚àö3), and point O is at (0,0).Now, the squirrel from A is moving towards O along AO, which is the x-axis. The squirrel from B is moving towards O along BO, which is the line from (40, 40‚àö3) to (0,0).After passing O, the squirrel from A continues along the negative x-axis, and the squirrel from B continues along the line beyond O in the direction opposite to BO.Let me parameterize their positions.For the squirrel from A:- Before reaching O (t < t2), its position is (120 - d(t), 0) = (120 - v t, 0).- After passing O (t >= t2), its position is ( - (d(t) - 120), 0) = ( - (v t - 120), 0).For the squirrel from B:- Before reaching O (t < t1), its position is (40 - (40 / 80) * d(t), 40‚àö3 - (40‚àö3 / 80) * d(t)).Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, since it's moving along BO towards O, which is a straight line from (40, 40‚àö3) to (0,0). So, the parametric equations for the squirrel from B can be written as:x(t) = 40 - (40 / 80) * d(t) = 40 - 0.5 * d(t)y(t) = 40‚àö3 - (40‚àö3 / 80) * d(t) = 40‚àö3 - 0.5‚àö3 * d(t)Similarly, after passing O, it continues beyond O along the same line. So, for t >= t1, the position would be:x(t) = -0.5 * (d(t) - 80)y(t) = -0.5‚àö3 * (d(t) - 80)Because beyond O, it's moving in the opposite direction, so subtracting from O.But since both squirrels move at the same speed, d(t) = v t. So, we can write their positions as functions of t.But maybe it's better to express their positions in terms of a parameter s, where s is the distance traveled from their starting points. So, s = v t, but since we're looking for the minimum distance, we can consider s as a variable and find the minimum distance as a function of s.So, let's define s as the distance each squirrel has traveled from their starting points. So, for the squirrel from A:- If s <= 120: position is (120 - s, 0)- If s > 120: position is ( - (s - 120), 0)For the squirrel from B:- If s <= 80: position is (40 - 0.5 s, 40‚àö3 - 0.5‚àö3 s)- If s > 80: position is ( -0.5 (s - 80), -0.5‚àö3 (s - 80))So, now, the distance between the two squirrels as a function of s can be written as:If s <= 80: both squirrels are approaching O.Distance D(s) = sqrt[( (120 - s) - (40 - 0.5 s) )^2 + (0 - (40‚àö3 - 0.5‚àö3 s))^2]Simplify the expressions inside the sqrt:x-coordinate difference: (120 - s) - (40 - 0.5 s) = 120 - s - 40 + 0.5 s = 80 - 0.5 sy-coordinate difference: 0 - (40‚àö3 - 0.5‚àö3 s) = -40‚àö3 + 0.5‚àö3 sSo, D(s) = sqrt[ (80 - 0.5 s)^2 + (-40‚àö3 + 0.5‚àö3 s)^2 ]Let me compute this:First, expand (80 - 0.5 s)^2:= 80^2 - 2 * 80 * 0.5 s + (0.5 s)^2= 6400 - 80 s + 0.25 s^2Next, expand (-40‚àö3 + 0.5‚àö3 s)^2:= ( -40‚àö3 )^2 + 2 * (-40‚àö3)(0.5‚àö3 s) + (0.5‚àö3 s)^2= 1600 * 3 + 2 * (-40‚àö3)(0.5‚àö3 s) + 0.25 * 3 s^2= 4800 - 2 * 40 * 0.5 * 3 s + 0.75 s^2= 4800 - 120 s + 0.75 s^2Now, add both expansions:6400 - 80 s + 0.25 s^2 + 4800 - 120 s + 0.75 s^2= (6400 + 4800) + (-80 s - 120 s) + (0.25 s^2 + 0.75 s^2)= 11200 - 200 s + s^2So, D(s) = sqrt(s^2 - 200 s + 11200) for s <= 80.To find the minimum distance, we can find the minimum of the function inside the sqrt, which is a quadratic function f(s) = s^2 - 200 s + 11200.The minimum of a quadratic function f(s) = a s^2 + b s + c occurs at s = -b/(2a). Here, a = 1, b = -200, so s = 200/(2*1) = 100.But wait, s = 100 is greater than 80, which is the upper limit for this interval. So, the minimum in the interval s <= 80 occurs at s = 80.So, let's compute D(80):f(80) = 80^2 - 200 * 80 + 11200 = 6400 - 16000 + 11200 = (6400 + 11200) - 16000 = 17600 - 16000 = 1600.So, D(80) = sqrt(1600) = 40 meters.But wait, is this the minimum? Because after s = 80, the squirrel from B has passed O and is moving beyond, while the squirrel from A is still moving towards O until s = 120.So, we need to consider the interval s between 80 and 120.In this interval, the squirrel from A is still moving towards O, while the squirrel from B has passed O and is moving beyond.So, let's define their positions:For the squirrel from A: position is (120 - s, 0)For the squirrel from B: position is ( -0.5 (s - 80), -0.5‚àö3 (s - 80) )So, let's compute the distance D(s) between these two points.x-coordinate difference: (120 - s) - ( -0.5 (s - 80) ) = 120 - s + 0.5 s - 40 = 80 - 0.5 sy-coordinate difference: 0 - ( -0.5‚àö3 (s - 80) ) = 0 + 0.5‚àö3 (s - 80) = 0.5‚àö3 (s - 80)So, D(s) = sqrt[ (80 - 0.5 s)^2 + (0.5‚àö3 (s - 80))^2 ]Let me compute this:First, expand (80 - 0.5 s)^2:= 6400 - 80 s + 0.25 s^2Next, expand (0.5‚àö3 (s - 80))^2:= (0.5‚àö3)^2 (s - 80)^2= 0.75 (s^2 - 160 s + 6400)= 0.75 s^2 - 120 s + 4800Now, add both expansions:6400 - 80 s + 0.25 s^2 + 0.75 s^2 - 120 s + 4800= (6400 + 4800) + (-80 s - 120 s) + (0.25 s^2 + 0.75 s^2)= 11200 - 200 s + s^2So, D(s) = sqrt(s^2 - 200 s + 11200) for 80 <= s <= 120.Wait, that's the same expression as before! So, the function inside the sqrt is the same quadratic function f(s) = s^2 - 200 s + 11200.So, the minimum occurs at s = 100, which is within the interval 80 <= s <= 120.Therefore, the minimum distance is at s = 100.Compute f(100):f(100) = 100^2 - 200 * 100 + 11200 = 10000 - 20000 + 11200 = (10000 + 11200) - 20000 = 21200 - 20000 = 1200.So, D(100) = sqrt(1200) = sqrt(400 * 3) = 20‚àö3 ‚âà 34.64 meters.So, this is less than the previous minimum at s = 80, which was 40 meters.Now, after s = 120, both squirrels have passed O and are moving beyond.So, for s > 120, the squirrel from A is at position ( - (s - 120), 0 ) and the squirrel from B is at position ( -0.5 (s - 80), -0.5‚àö3 (s - 80) ).Let's compute the distance D(s) in this interval.x-coordinate difference: ( - (s - 120) ) - ( -0.5 (s - 80) ) = -s + 120 + 0.5 s - 40 = (-0.5 s) + 80y-coordinate difference: 0 - ( -0.5‚àö3 (s - 80) ) = 0 + 0.5‚àö3 (s - 80) = 0.5‚àö3 (s - 80)So, D(s) = sqrt[ (-0.5 s + 80)^2 + (0.5‚àö3 (s - 80))^2 ]Let me compute this:First, expand (-0.5 s + 80)^2:= (0.5 s - 80)^2= 0.25 s^2 - 80 * 0.5 s + 6400= 0.25 s^2 - 40 s + 6400Next, expand (0.5‚àö3 (s - 80))^2:= 0.75 (s - 80)^2= 0.75 (s^2 - 160 s + 6400)= 0.75 s^2 - 120 s + 4800Now, add both expansions:0.25 s^2 - 40 s + 6400 + 0.75 s^2 - 120 s + 4800= (0.25 s^2 + 0.75 s^2) + (-40 s - 120 s) + (6400 + 4800)= s^2 - 160 s + 11200So, D(s) = sqrt(s^2 - 160 s + 11200) for s >= 120.Again, this is a quadratic function inside the sqrt. Let's find its minimum.The quadratic function is f(s) = s^2 - 160 s + 11200.The minimum occurs at s = -b/(2a) = 160/(2*1) = 80.But s = 80 is less than 120, so the minimum in the interval s >= 120 occurs at s = 120.Compute f(120):f(120) = 120^2 - 160 * 120 + 11200 = 14400 - 19200 + 11200 = (14400 + 11200) - 19200 = 25600 - 19200 = 6400.So, D(120) = sqrt(6400) = 80 meters.So, in the interval s >= 120, the minimum distance is 80 meters, which is greater than the previous minimum of 20‚àö3 meters.Therefore, the overall minimum distance occurs at s = 100, which is 20‚àö3 meters.Wait, but let me double-check if this is correct.At s = 100, the squirrel from A is at position (120 - 100, 0) = (20, 0), and the squirrel from B is at position ( -0.5 (100 - 80), -0.5‚àö3 (100 - 80) ) = ( -0.5 * 20, -0.5‚àö3 * 20 ) = (-10, -10‚àö3).So, the distance between (20, 0) and (-10, -10‚àö3) is sqrt[ (20 - (-10))^2 + (0 - (-10‚àö3))^2 ] = sqrt[ (30)^2 + (10‚àö3)^2 ] = sqrt[900 + 300] = sqrt[1200] = 20‚àö3. Yes, that's correct.So, the minimum distance is 20‚àö3 meters.I think this makes sense. The minimum distance occurs when the squirrels are on opposite sides of O, but not too far apart yet. The geometry of the problem, with the 60-degree angle, leads to this minimum distance.I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think this is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The minimum distance between the squirrels during their movement is boxed{20sqrt{3}} meters."},{"question":"Find the equation of the plane containing the points (1,0,2), (5,0,4), and (7,-2,3). Enter your answer in the form[ Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, ] where A, B, C, D are integers such that A > 0 and gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the equation of a plane that contains three given points: (1,0,2), (5,0,4), and (7,-2,3). Hmm, I remember that to find the equation of a plane, I need a point on the plane and a normal vector to the plane. Since I have three points, I can use two of them to create vectors that lie on the plane, and then take the cross product of those vectors to get the normal vector. That makes sense.Let me label the points for clarity. Let‚Äôs say point A is (1,0,2), point B is (5,0,4), and point C is (7,-2,3). So, vectors AB and AC will lie on the plane. To find vector AB, I subtract the coordinates of A from B. That would be (5-1, 0-0, 4-2) which is (4,0,2). Similarly, vector AC is (7-1, -2-0, 3-2) which is (6,-2,1). Okay, so vectors AB = (4,0,2) and AC = (6,-2,1).Now, the cross product of AB and AC will give me the normal vector to the plane. The cross product formula is a bit tricky, but I think it goes like this: if I have two vectors, say vector u = (u1, u2, u3) and vector v = (v1, v2, v3), then their cross product u √ó v is given by the determinant of a matrix with the standard unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of u in the second row, and the components of v in the third row. So, it's:i  j  ku1 u2 u3v1 v2 v3Calculating this determinant gives me the cross product vector. Let me write that out for AB and AC.So, for AB = (4,0,2) and AC = (6,-2,1), the cross product AB √ó AC is:|i ¬†¬†j ¬†¬†k||4 ¬†¬†0 ¬†¬†2||6 ¬†-2 ¬†¬†1|Calculating this determinant, I get:i*(0*1 - 2*(-2)) - j*(4*1 - 2*6) + k*(4*(-2) - 0*6)Let me compute each component step by step.First, the i component: 0*1 is 0, and 2*(-2) is -4. So, 0 - (-4) is 4. So, i*4.Next, the j component: 4*1 is 4, and 2*6 is 12. So, 4 - 12 is -8. But since it's subtracted, it becomes -(-8) which is +8j.Wait, hold on, let me make sure. The formula is:i*(u2v3 - u3v2) - j*(u1v3 - u3v1) + k*(u1v2 - u2v1)So, plugging in the values:i*(0*1 - 2*(-2)) = i*(0 + 4) = 4i-j*(4*1 - 2*6) = -j*(4 - 12) = -j*(-8) = 8jk*(4*(-2) - 0*6) = k*(-8 - 0) = -8kSo, putting it all together, the cross product AB √ó AC is (4, 8, -8). Hmm, that seems correct.But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check the cross product formula. The cross product of AB = (4,0,2) and AC = (6,-2,1) is:i*(0*1 - 2*(-2)) - j*(4*1 - 2*6) + k*(4*(-2) - 0*6)So, i*(0 + 4) = 4i-j*(4 - 12) = -j*(-8) = 8jk*(-8 - 0) = -8kYes, so the cross product is (4, 8, -8). Alternatively, I can factor out a 4 to make it simpler: 4*(1, 2, -2). But maybe I don't need to do that right now.So, the normal vector n is (4,8,-8). But I can simplify this by dividing by 4, which gives (1,2,-2). Wait, is that correct? Because 4 divided by 4 is 1, 8 divided by 4 is 2, and -8 divided by 4 is -2. So, yes, the normal vector can be simplified to (1,2,-2). That might make the equation of the plane simpler.But actually, in the cross product, the normal vector is (4,8,-8). I think both are correct, but using the simplified one might be better for the equation of the plane because the coefficients will be smaller.So, let's use the normal vector n = (1,2,-2). Now, the general equation of a plane is given by:A(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0Where (A,B,C) is the normal vector and (x0,y0,z0) is a point on the plane. I can use point A (1,0,2) for this.Plugging in, we get:1*(x - 1) + 2*(y - 0) + (-2)*(z - 2) = 0Let me expand this:1*x - 1*1 + 2*y - 2*0 -2*z + (-2)*(-2) = 0Simplify each term:x - 1 + 2y + 0 - 2z + 4 = 0Combine like terms:x + 2y - 2z + (-1 + 4) = 0Which simplifies to:x + 2y - 2z + 3 = 0Wait, is that correct? Let me check my steps again.Starting from the equation:1*(x - 1) + 2*(y - 0) - 2*(z - 2) = 0Expanding:x - 1 + 2y - 2z + 4 = 0Because -2*(z - 2) is -2z + 4.So, combining constants: -1 + 4 is 3.So, x + 2y - 2z + 3 = 0.Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify if this plane actually contains all three points.First, let's test point A (1,0,2):1 + 2*0 - 2*2 + 3 = 1 + 0 - 4 + 3 = 0. Yes, that works.Point B (5,0,4):5 + 2*0 - 2*4 + 3 = 5 + 0 - 8 + 3 = 0. That also works.Point C (7,-2,3):7 + 2*(-2) - 2*3 + 3 = 7 - 4 - 6 + 3 = 0. Yes, that works too.So, the equation x + 2y - 2z + 3 = 0 is correct.But wait, in the initial cross product, I had (4,8,-8). If I use that normal vector instead, what would the equation be?Using n = (4,8,-8) and point A (1,0,2):4*(x - 1) + 8*(y - 0) - 8*(z - 2) = 0Expanding:4x - 4 + 8y - 8z + 16 = 0Combine constants: -4 + 16 = 12So, 4x + 8y - 8z + 12 = 0We can factor out a 4:4(x + 2y - 2z + 3) = 0Which simplifies to x + 2y - 2z + 3 = 0, same as before.So, both normal vectors give the same plane equation, just scaled by a factor of 4. Since the problem asks for integers A, B, C, D with A > 0 and gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1, we need to make sure that the coefficients are in the simplest form.In our equation, x + 2y - 2z + 3 = 0, the coefficients are 1, 2, -2, 3. The gcd of 1, 2, 2, 3 is 1, so that's already in the simplest form.Wait, but let me check the gcd. The gcd of 1, 2, 2, 3. The greatest common divisor of these numbers is 1 because 1 is a divisor of all integers, and there's no larger integer that divides all of them. So, yes, this satisfies the condition.Therefore, the equation of the plane is x + 2y - 2z + 3 = 0.But just to make sure, let me go back through the steps again.1. Found vectors AB and AC correctly.2. Calculated the cross product correctly, got (4,8,-8).3. Simplified the normal vector to (1,2,-2).4. Plugged into the plane equation using point A.5. Expanded and simplified correctly.6. Verified with all three points.7. Checked the gcd condition.Everything seems to check out. So, I think I'm confident that the equation is correct.**Final Answer**The equation of the plane is boxed{x + 2y - 2z + 3 = 0}."},{"question":"There are 3 kinds of books in the library: physics, chemistry, and biology.

( 2^{-2004} )  B. (-1)  C. ( 1 )  D. None of the above","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about complex numbers. It says that non-zero complex numbers ( x ) and ( y ) satisfy the equation ( x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0 ). I need to find the value of the expression ( left( frac{x}{x + y} right)^{2005} + left( frac{y}{x + y} right)^{2005} ). The options are ( 2^{-2004} ), (-1), (1), or none of the above. Hmm, okay.First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving complex numbers, especially ones that look symmetric in ( x ) and ( y ), it's often useful to consider the ratio ( frac{x}{y} ) or ( frac{y}{x} ). Maybe I can set ( omega = frac{x}{y} ) to simplify things. Let me try that.If I let ( omega = frac{x}{y} ), then the equation ( x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0 ) can be rewritten in terms of ( omega ). Dividing both sides by ( y^2 ) (since ( y ) is non-zero), we get:[left( frac{x}{y} right)^2 + frac{x}{y} + 1 = 0]Which simplifies to:[omega^2 + omega + 1 = 0]Okay, so now I have a quadratic equation in ( omega ). I can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula tells me that for an equation ( aomega^2 + bomega + c = 0 ), the solutions are:[omega = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]In this case, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ), and ( c = 1 ). Plugging these values in:[omega = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{-3}}{2} = frac{-1 pm isqrt{3}}{2}]So, ( omega ) is a complex number, specifically one of the cube roots of unity, except for 1. The cube roots of unity satisfy ( omega^3 = 1 ), which means ( omega^3 = 1 ) and ( omega neq 1 ). That's useful because it tells me that ( omega ) has some cyclical properties when raised to powers.Now, looking back at the expression I need to evaluate:[left( frac{x}{x + y} right)^{2005} + left( frac{y}{x + y} right)^{2005}]Let me express this in terms of ( omega ). Since ( omega = frac{x}{y} ), then ( frac{x}{x + y} = frac{omega}{omega + 1} ) and ( frac{y}{x + y} = frac{1}{omega + 1} ). So, substituting these into the expression:[left( frac{omega}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} + left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005}]Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out ( frac{1}{omega + 1} ) from both terms. Let's see:[left( frac{omega}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} + left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} = left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} left( omega^{2005} + 1 right)]So, now I have:[left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} left( omega^{2005} + 1 right)]I need to simplify this expression. Let me first figure out what ( omega + 1 ) is. Since ( omega^2 + omega + 1 = 0 ), that means ( omega + 1 = -omega^2 ). So, ( omega + 1 = -omega^2 ). Therefore, ( frac{1}{omega + 1} = -frac{1}{omega^2} ).Substituting back into the expression:[left( -frac{1}{omega^2} right)^{2005} left( omega^{2005} + 1 right)]Simplify the exponent:[(-1)^{2005} left( frac{1}{omega^{4010}} right) left( omega^{2005} + 1 right)]Since ( (-1)^{2005} = -1 ), because 2005 is odd. So:[- left( frac{1}{omega^{4010}} right) left( omega^{2005} + 1 right)]Now, let's simplify the exponents. Remember that ( omega^3 = 1 ), so ( omega^k = omega^{k mod 3} ). Let's compute ( 4010 mod 3 ) and ( 2005 mod 3 ).First, ( 4010 div 3 ) is 1336 with a remainder of 2, because 3*1336 = 4008, so 4010 - 4008 = 2. So, ( 4010 mod 3 = 2 ).Similarly, ( 2005 div 3 ) is 668 with a remainder of 1, because 3*668 = 2004, so 2005 - 2004 = 1. So, ( 2005 mod 3 = 1 ).Therefore, ( omega^{4010} = omega^{2} ) and ( omega^{2005} = omega^{1} = omega ).Substituting back:[- left( frac{1}{omega^{2}} right) left( omega + 1 right)]But earlier, we found that ( omega + 1 = -omega^2 ). So, substitute that in:[- left( frac{1}{omega^{2}} right) left( -omega^2 right )]Simplify:[- left( frac{1}{omega^{2}} times -omega^2 right ) = - left( -1 right ) = 1]Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.Starting from:[left( frac{x}{x + y} right)^{2005} + left( frac{y}{x + y} right)^{2005}]Expressed in terms of ( omega ):[left( frac{omega}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} + left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005}]Factored:[left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} ( omega^{2005} + 1 )]Then, since ( omega + 1 = -omega^2 ):[left( -frac{1}{omega^2} right)^{2005} ( omega^{2005} + 1 )]Which is:[(-1)^{2005} times left( frac{1}{omega^{4010}} right ) times ( omega^{2005} + 1 )]Which simplifies to:[- times frac{1}{omega^{2}} times ( omega + 1 )]And since ( omega + 1 = -omega^2 ):[- times frac{1}{omega^{2}} times (-omega^2 ) = - times (-1) = 1]Okay, that seems consistent. So, the expression simplifies to 1. Therefore, the answer should be option C, which is 1.But wait, let me think again. The original equation was ( x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0 ). If I set ( omega = frac{x}{y} ), then ( omega^2 + omega + 1 = 0 ), which gives us the cube roots of unity. So, ( omega ) is a primitive cube root of unity, meaning ( omega^3 = 1 ) and ( omega neq 1 ). Therefore, ( omega^3 = 1 ), so ( omega^k = omega^{k mod 3} ).Given that, ( omega^{2005} = omega^{2005 mod 3} ). Let's compute ( 2005 div 3 ). 3*668=2004, so 2005=3*668 +1, so ( 2005 mod 3 =1 ). Therefore, ( omega^{2005} = omega ). Similarly, ( omega^{4010} = omega^{4010 mod 3} ). 4010 divided by 3: 3*1336=4008, so 4010=3*1336 +2, so ( 4010 mod 3=2 ). Therefore, ( omega^{4010} = omega^2 ).So, substituting back, we have:[- times frac{1}{omega^2} times ( omega + 1 )]But ( omega +1 = -omega^2 ), so:[- times frac{1}{omega^2} times (-omega^2 ) = - times (-1) =1]Yes, that seems correct. So, the expression evaluates to 1. Therefore, the answer is C, 1.But let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe without using the cube roots of unity. Perhaps by manipulating the original equation.Given ( x^2 + xy + y^2 =0 ), we can write this as ( x^2 = -xy - y^2 ). Maybe I can express ( x ) in terms of ( y ) or vice versa.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression ( frac{x}{x + y} ) and ( frac{y}{x + y} ). Let me denote ( a = frac{x}{x + y} ) and ( b = frac{y}{x + y} ). Then, ( a + b =1 ). So, the expression we need is ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} ).Given that ( a + b =1 ), maybe we can find a relationship between ( a ) and ( b ). Also, from the original equation ( x^2 + xy + y^2 =0 ), perhaps we can relate ( a ) and ( b ).Let me express ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ). Since ( a = frac{x}{x + y} ), then ( x = a(x + y) ), so ( x = a x + a y ), which gives ( x - a x = a y ), so ( x(1 - a) = a y ), so ( frac{x}{y} = frac{a}{1 - a} ). Similarly, ( frac{y}{x} = frac{1 - a}{a} ).Given that ( frac{x}{y} = omega ), so ( omega = frac{a}{1 - a} ). Therefore, ( a = frac{omega}{1 + omega} ). Similarly, ( b = frac{1}{1 + omega} ).So, ( a = frac{omega}{1 + omega} ) and ( b = frac{1}{1 + omega} ). Therefore, ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} = left( frac{omega}{1 + omega} right)^{2005} + left( frac{1}{1 + omega} right)^{2005} ).Which is the same expression as before. So, we come back to the same point. So, it seems that regardless of the approach, we end up with the same expression, which simplifies to 1.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ( omega^2 + omega +1 =0 ), so ( omega^2 = -omega -1 ). Maybe I can use this to simplify ( omega^{2005} ).Since ( omega^3 =1 ), ( omega^{2005} = omega^{3*668 +1} = (omega^3)^{668} * omega^1 =1^{668} * omega = omega ). Similarly, ( omega^{4010} = (omega^3)^{1336} * omega^2 =1^{1336} * omega^2 = omega^2 ).So, substituting back, the expression becomes:[- times frac{1}{omega^2} times (-omega^2 ) =1]Yes, that's consistent.Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is ( left( frac{x}{x + y} right)^{2005} + left( frac{y}{x + y} right)^{2005} ). So, if ( a = frac{x}{x + y} ) and ( b = frac{y}{x + y} ), then ( a + b =1 ). So, we're looking for ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} ).Given that ( a + b =1 ), and knowing that ( a ) and ( b ) are related through the original equation, which led us to ( omega ), perhaps there's a pattern or a property that can help us find ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} ).Alternatively, maybe I can consider that ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy some quadratic equation. Since ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab = frac{x y}{(x + y)^2} ). Let me compute ( ab ).Given ( a = frac{x}{x + y} ) and ( b = frac{y}{x + y} ), then ( ab = frac{x y}{(x + y)^2} ). From the original equation ( x^2 + xy + y^2 =0 ), we can write ( x^2 + y^2 = -xy ). Also, ( (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + 2xy = (-xy) + 2xy = xy ). Therefore, ( (x + y)^2 = xy ), so ( ab = frac{xy}{(x + y)^2} = frac{xy}{xy} =1 ).Wait, that's interesting. So, ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab =1 ). So, ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy the quadratic equation ( t^2 - t +1 =0 ). Let me check:If ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab =1 ), then the quadratic equation is ( t^2 - (a + b)t + ab = t^2 - t +1 =0 ). So, ( a ) and ( b ) are roots of ( t^2 - t +1 =0 ).But wait, the roots of ( t^2 - t +1 =0 ) are ( t = frac{1 pm sqrt{-3}}{2} ), which are the same as ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), the non-real cube roots of unity. So, ( a ) and ( b ) are actually ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ). Therefore, ( a = omega ) and ( b = omega^2 ), or vice versa.Therefore, ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} = omega^{2005} + (omega^2)^{2005} ).But since ( omega^3 =1 ), ( omega^{2005} = omega^{3*668 +1} = (omega^3)^{668} * omega =1^{668} * omega = omega ). Similarly, ( (omega^2)^{2005} = omega^{4010} = omega^{3*1336 +2} = (omega^3)^{1336} * omega^2 =1^{1336} * omega^2 = omega^2 ).Therefore, ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} = omega + omega^2 ).But from the original equation ( omega^2 + omega +1 =0 ), we have ( omega + omega^2 = -1 ). Therefore, ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} = -1 ).Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion where I got 1. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me see where I went wrong.Earlier, I expressed the expression as:[left( frac{omega}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} + left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005}]Then, I factored out ( left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} ) to get:[left( frac{1}{omega + 1} right)^{2005} ( omega^{2005} +1 )]Then, since ( omega +1 = -omega^2 ), I substituted:[left( -frac{1}{omega^2} right)^{2005} ( omega^{2005} +1 )]Which became:[(-1)^{2005} times frac{1}{omega^{4010}} times ( omega^{2005} +1 )]Since ( (-1)^{2005} = -1 ), and ( omega^{4010} = omega^2 ), and ( omega^{2005} = omega ), this became:[- times frac{1}{omega^2} times ( omega +1 ) = - times frac{1}{omega^2} times (-omega^2 ) =1]But in the second approach, considering ( a ) and ( b ) as ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), I got ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} = omega + omega^2 = -1 ).So, which one is correct? There seems to be a contradiction here. Let me figure out where the mistake is.In the first approach, I considered ( a = frac{omega}{omega +1} ) and ( b = frac{1}{omega +1} ), and then expressed the expression in terms of ( omega ). However, in the second approach, I considered ( a ) and ( b ) as roots of ( t^2 - t +1 =0 ), which are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ).Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the first approach when I assumed ( a = frac{omega}{omega +1} ) and ( b = frac{1}{omega +1} ). Let me verify that.Given ( a = frac{x}{x + y} ) and ( omega = frac{x}{y} ), then ( a = frac{omega y}{omega y + y} = frac{omega}{omega +1} ). Similarly, ( b = frac{y}{x + y} = frac{y}{omega y + y} = frac{1}{omega +1} ). So, that part is correct.But then, in the second approach, I considered ( a ) and ( b ) as roots of ( t^2 - t +1 =0 ), which are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ). However, in reality, ( a = frac{omega}{omega +1} ) and ( b = frac{1}{omega +1} ), which are different from ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ). So, perhaps the second approach was flawed because I incorrectly assumed ( a ) and ( b ) are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ).Wait, but earlier, I found that ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab =1 ), which would imply that ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy ( t^2 - t +1 =0 ), whose roots are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ). So, that suggests that ( a ) and ( b ) are indeed ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ). But in the first approach, I expressed ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of ( omega ) and got a different result.This is confusing. Let me try to reconcile these two approaches.In the first approach, I expressed ( a = frac{omega}{omega +1} ) and ( b = frac{1}{omega +1} ). Then, I tried to compute ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} ) and got 1.In the second approach, I considered ( a ) and ( b ) as roots of ( t^2 - t +1 =0 ), which are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), and thus ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} = omega + omega^2 = -1 ).So, which one is correct? It seems like there's a contradiction. Let me check the computations again.First, in the first approach, I had:[a = frac{omega}{omega +1}, quad b = frac{1}{omega +1}]Then, ( a + b = frac{omega}{omega +1} + frac{1}{omega +1} = frac{omega +1}{omega +1} =1 ), which is correct.Also, ( ab = frac{omega}{omega +1} times frac{1}{omega +1} = frac{omega}{(omega +1)^2} ). But earlier, I thought ( ab =1 ), but that might not be correct.Wait, let's compute ( ab ):From ( a = frac{x}{x + y} ) and ( b = frac{y}{x + y} ), then ( ab = frac{xy}{(x + y)^2} ). From the original equation ( x^2 + xy + y^2 =0 ), we can write ( (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + 2xy = (-xy) + 2xy = xy ). Therefore, ( (x + y)^2 = xy ), so ( ab = frac{xy}{(x + y)^2} = frac{xy}{xy} =1 ). So, ( ab =1 ).Therefore, ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab =1 ), which means they are roots of ( t^2 - t +1 =0 ), whose roots are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ). Therefore, ( a ) and ( b ) are indeed ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ).But in the first approach, I expressed ( a = frac{omega}{omega +1} ) and ( b = frac{1}{omega +1} ). So, perhaps ( frac{omega}{omega +1} = omega ) or ( omega^2 )?Let me check:If ( frac{omega}{omega +1} = omega ), then:[frac{omega}{omega +1} = omega implies omega = omega(omega +1) implies omega = omega^2 + omega implies 0 = omega^2]But ( omega^2 neq0 ), so that's not possible.Alternatively, if ( frac{omega}{omega +1} = omega^2 ), then:[frac{omega}{omega +1} = omega^2 implies omega = omega^2 (omega +1 ) implies omega = omega^3 + omega^2]But ( omega^3 =1 ), so:[omega =1 + omega^2]But from the original equation ( omega^2 + omega +1 =0 ), we have ( omega^2 = -omega -1 ). Substituting:[omega =1 + (-omega -1 ) = -omega]Which implies ( omega = -omega implies 2omega =0 implies omega =0 ), which contradicts ( omega neq0 ).Therefore, my initial assumption that ( a = frac{omega}{omega +1} ) and ( b = frac{1}{omega +1} ) being equal to ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ) is incorrect. So, the second approach was flawed because I incorrectly assumed that ( a ) and ( b ) are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), but in reality, they are different.Therefore, the correct approach is the first one, where I expressed the expression in terms of ( omega ) and simplified it to 1. So, the answer should be 1.But wait, earlier in the second approach, I thought ( a ) and ( b ) are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), but that led to a different result. So, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that ( a ) and ( b ) are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), but in reality, they are not. Therefore, the first approach is correct, and the answer is 1.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab =1 ), and then use the recurrence relation for ( a^n + b^n ).Given that ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab =1 ), we can use the identity:[a^n + b^n = (a + b)(a^{n-1} + b^{n-1}) - ab(a^{n-2} + b^{n-2})]So, let's define ( S_n = a^n + b^n ). Then,[S_n = (a + b) S_{n-1} - ab S_{n-2}]Given ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab =1 ), this becomes:[S_n = S_{n-1} - S_{n-2}]Now, let's compute the first few terms to find a pattern.We know that ( S_0 = a^0 + b^0 =1 +1 =2 ).( S_1 = a + b =1 ).( S_2 = a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab =1^2 - 2*1 =1 -2 =-1 ).( S_3 = S_2 - S_1 = (-1) -1 =-2 ).( S_4 = S_3 - S_2 = (-2) - (-1) =-1 ).( S_5 = S_4 - S_3 = (-1) - (-2) =1 ).( S_6 = S_5 - S_4 =1 - (-1)=2 ).( S_7 = S_6 - S_5 =2 -1=1 ).( S_8 = S_7 - S_6 =1 -2=-1 ).Hmm, interesting. The sequence of ( S_n ) is periodic with period 6: 2,1,-1,-2,-1,1,2,1,-1,...So, the sequence cycles every 6 terms. Therefore, ( S_n = S_{n mod 6} ).Given that, let's compute ( 2005 mod 6 ).Divide 2005 by 6:6*334 =2004, so 2005=6*334 +1, so ( 2005 mod6=1 ).Therefore, ( S_{2005} = S_1 =1 ).Therefore, the expression ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} =1 ).So, that confirms the result from the first approach. Therefore, the answer is 1.But wait, earlier in the second approach, I thought ( a ) and ( b ) are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), which led to ( a^{2005} + b^{2005} =-1 ). But this contradicts the first approach and the recurrence relation approach, which both give 1.So, where is the mistake? It seems that in the second approach, I incorrectly assumed that ( a ) and ( b ) are ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), but in reality, they are not. Instead, ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy ( a + b =1 ) and ( ab =1 ), which are different from the properties of ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ).Therefore, the correct answer is 1, which is option C.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of vectors or geometry, but that might complicate things further. Given that both the first approach and the recurrence relation approach lead to the same result, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 1.So, after carefully considering different approaches and verifying the results, I believe the correct answer is 1."},{"question":"Given frac{1+sin 2Œ∏}{cos^{2}Œ∏-sin^{2}Œ∏}=-3, find tan Œ∏=(   ).A: 2B: -1C: -1 or 2D: 1 or -2","answer":"Okay, so I've got this trigonometry problem here, and I need to find the value of tan Œ∏ given the equation:(1 + sin 2Œ∏) / (cos¬≤Œ∏ - sin¬≤Œ∏) = -3Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that might help simplify this expression. Let me jot them down.First, I recall that sin 2Œ∏ is equal to 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏. So, maybe I can rewrite the numerator using that identity. Let me try that:Numerator: 1 + sin 2Œ∏ = 1 + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏Now, looking at the denominator: cos¬≤Œ∏ - sin¬≤Œ∏. I think that's another identity. Isn't that equal to cos 2Œ∏? Let me confirm:cos 2Œ∏ = cos¬≤Œ∏ - sin¬≤Œ∏Yes, that's correct. So, the denominator simplifies to cos 2Œ∏. So, substituting back into the original equation, we have:(1 + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏) / cos 2Œ∏ = -3Hmm, okay. So, now the equation is:(1 + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏) / cos 2Œ∏ = -3I need to find tan Œ∏, so maybe I can express everything in terms of tan Œ∏. Let me recall that tan Œ∏ = sin Œ∏ / cos Œ∏. So, perhaps I can divide both the numerator and the denominator by cos¬≤Œ∏ to express everything in terms of tan Œ∏.Let me try that. Let's set t = tan Œ∏. Then, sin Œ∏ = t cos Œ∏, and since sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1, we have:(t cos Œ∏)¬≤ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1 => t¬≤ cos¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1 => cos¬≤Œ∏ (t¬≤ + 1) = 1 => cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1 / (t¬≤ + 1)So, cos Œ∏ = 1 / sqrt(t¬≤ + 1), but I might not need that right now. Let's go back to the equation:(1 + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏) / cos 2Œ∏ = -3Expressing sin Œ∏ and cos Œ∏ in terms of t:sin Œ∏ = t cos Œ∏So, 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = 2 t cos¬≤Œ∏And 1 = sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = t¬≤ cos¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = cos¬≤Œ∏ (t¬≤ + 1)So, substituting back into the numerator:1 + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = cos¬≤Œ∏ (t¬≤ + 1) + 2 t cos¬≤Œ∏ = cos¬≤Œ∏ (t¬≤ + 1 + 2t)Similarly, the denominator is cos 2Œ∏. I know that cos 2Œ∏ can be expressed in terms of tan Œ∏ as:cos 2Œ∏ = (1 - tan¬≤Œ∏) / (1 + tan¬≤Œ∏) = (1 - t¬≤) / (1 + t¬≤)So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:[cos¬≤Œ∏ (t¬≤ + 1 + 2t)] / [(1 - t¬≤) / (1 + t¬≤)] = -3Simplify the denominator:Dividing by (1 - t¬≤)/(1 + t¬≤) is the same as multiplying by (1 + t¬≤)/(1 - t¬≤). So:cos¬≤Œ∏ (t¬≤ + 1 + 2t) * (1 + t¬≤) / (1 - t¬≤) = -3But earlier, we found that cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1 / (1 + t¬≤). So, substituting that in:[1 / (1 + t¬≤)] * (t¬≤ + 1 + 2t) * (1 + t¬≤) / (1 - t¬≤) = -3Simplify this expression:The (1 + t¬≤) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:(t¬≤ + 1 + 2t) / (1 - t¬≤) = -3Notice that t¬≤ + 1 + 2t is equal to (t + 1)¬≤. So, we have:(t + 1)¬≤ / (1 - t¬≤) = -3Let me write that as:(t + 1)¬≤ / (1 - t)(1 + t) = -3Simplify the denominator:1 - t¬≤ = (1 - t)(1 + t)So, the equation becomes:(t + 1)¬≤ / [(1 - t)(1 + t)] = -3We can cancel one (1 + t) term from numerator and denominator, assuming that 1 + t ‚â† 0, which means t ‚â† -1. So, we have:(t + 1) / (1 - t) = -3Now, solve for t:(t + 1) / (1 - t) = -3Multiply both sides by (1 - t):t + 1 = -3(1 - t)Expand the right side:t + 1 = -3 + 3tBring all terms to one side:t + 1 + 3 - 3t = 0Combine like terms:(-2t) + 4 = 0-2t = -4Divide both sides by -2:t = 2So, tan Œ∏ = 2.But wait, earlier we assumed that 1 + t ‚â† 0, which is t ‚â† -1. So, we need to check if t = -1 is a possible solution or not.Let me go back to the original equation:(1 + sin 2Œ∏) / (cos¬≤Œ∏ - sin¬≤Œ∏) = -3If tan Œ∏ = -1, then sin Œ∏ = -cos Œ∏. Let's compute the numerator and denominator:Numerator: 1 + sin 2Œ∏ = 1 + 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏Since sin Œ∏ = -cos Œ∏, sin 2Œ∏ = 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = 2*(-cos Œ∏)*cos Œ∏ = -2 cos¬≤Œ∏So, numerator becomes: 1 - 2 cos¬≤Œ∏Denominator: cos¬≤Œ∏ - sin¬≤Œ∏ = cos¬≤Œ∏ - sin¬≤Œ∏ = cos¬≤Œ∏ - cos¬≤Œ∏ = 0Wait, the denominator becomes zero, which would make the expression undefined. So, tan Œ∏ = -1 is not a valid solution because it makes the denominator zero, which is undefined.Therefore, the only valid solution is tan Œ∏ = 2.So, the answer is A: 2.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"h(x) is a monic polynomial such that h(0) = 9 and h(2) = 25. If h(x) has degree 2, what is h(x)? Express your answer in the form ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a monic polynomial h(x) of degree 2. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So, the general form of a quadratic monic polynomial is h(x) = x¬≤ + bx + c, where b and c are constants that I need to find.The problem gives me two specific values: h(0) = 9 and h(2) = 25. I need to use these to figure out what b and c are. Let me start with h(0) because that seems straightforward.When x is 0, h(0) should be equal to 9. Plugging x = 0 into the polynomial, I get:h(0) = (0)¬≤ + b*(0) + c = 0 + 0 + c = c.So, h(0) = c = 9. That means c is 9. Okay, so now I know that the constant term is 9. So, the polynomial is now h(x) = x¬≤ + bx + 9.Next, I need to use the other piece of information: h(2) = 25. Let's plug x = 2 into the polynomial:h(2) = (2)¬≤ + b*(2) + 9 = 4 + 2b + 9.Simplify that: 4 + 9 is 13, so h(2) = 13 + 2b. But we know h(2) is 25, so:13 + 2b = 25.Now, I can solve for b. Subtract 13 from both sides:2b = 25 - 13 = 12.Then, divide both sides by 2:b = 12 / 2 = 6.So, b is 6. Now, plugging b back into the polynomial, we have:h(x) = x¬≤ + 6x + 9.Let me double-check to make sure this works. First, h(0) should be 9. Plugging in x = 0:h(0) = 0 + 0 + 9 = 9. That's correct.Next, h(2) should be 25. Plugging in x = 2:h(2) = (2)¬≤ + 6*(2) + 9 = 4 + 12 + 9 = 25. Perfect, that matches too.So, it looks like I've found the correct polynomial. It's monic, degree 2, and satisfies both given conditions.

Points C' and A' are on sides AB and BC respectively, and B' is the midpoint of AC. Part (a) asks me to prove that the area of triangle A'B'C' is not more than half of the area of triangle ABC. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.First, I know that in any triangle, the midpoint divides the side into two equal parts. So, since B' is the midpoint of AC, that means AB' = B'C. Now, C' is some point on AB, and A' is some point on BC. I need to figure out how the area of triangle A'B'C' relates to the area of ABC.Maybe I can use coordinate geometry to model this. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let's say point A is at (0, 0), point B is at (2b, 0), and point C is at (2c, 2d). I chose these coordinates because it might make calculations easier with midpoints and such.So, the midpoint B' of AC would be at ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d). Now, point C' is on AB. Let's parameterize C' as a point moving from A to B. Let me let C' be at (2t, 0) where t ranges from 0 to b. Similarly, point A' is on BC. Let me parameterize A' as moving from B to C. Let me let A' be at (2b + 2s(c - b), 2s d) where s ranges from 0 to 1. Hmm, that might be a bit complicated, but let's see.Wait, maybe it's simpler to use vectors or barycentric coordinates. But perhaps I can use area ratios instead. Since B' is the midpoint, maybe I can relate the areas using that property.I recall that if you have a triangle and you connect midpoints, you create smaller triangles with areas that are fractions of the original. But in this case, C' and A' are arbitrary, not necessarily midpoints. So, I need a different approach.Perhaps I can express the area of A'B'C' in terms of the areas of other triangles within ABC. Let me think about how A'B'C' is positioned inside ABC.Since C' is on AB and A' is on BC, and B' is the midpoint of AC, triangle A'B'C' is formed by connecting these three points. Maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles or area ratios based on the positions of C' and A'.Alternatively, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by coordinates. If I assign coordinates as I did before, I can compute the area of A'B'C' using the determinant formula.Let me try that. So, points:- A = (0, 0)- B = (2b, 0)- C = (2c, 2d)- B' = (c, d)- C' = (2t, 0) where 0 ‚â§ t ‚â§ b- A' = (2b + 2s(c - b), 2s d) where 0 ‚â§ s ‚â§ 1Now, the coordinates of A', B', and C' are:- A' = (2b + 2s(c - b), 2s d)- B' = (c, d)- C' = (2t, 0)The area of triangle A'B'C' can be calculated using the determinant formula:Area = (1/2) | (x_A' (y_B' - y_C') + x_B' (y_C' - y_A') + x_C' (y_A' - y_B')) |Plugging in the coordinates:= (1/2) | [ (2b + 2s(c - b))(d - 0) + c(0 - 2s d) + 2t(2s d - d) ] |Simplify each term:First term: (2b + 2s(c - b)) * d = 2b d + 2s(c - b) dSecond term: c * (-2s d) = -2s c dThird term: 2t * (2s d - d) = 2t (2s - 1) dSo, putting it all together:Area = (1/2) | 2b d + 2s(c - b) d - 2s c d + 2t (2s - 1) d |Simplify the expression inside the absolute value:= (1/2) | 2b d + 2s c d - 2s b d - 2s c d + 4s t d - 2t d |Notice that 2s c d cancels out:= (1/2) | 2b d - 2s b d + 4s t d - 2t d |Factor out 2d:= (1/2) | 2d (b - s b + 2s t - t) |= | d (b - s b + 2s t - t) |= | d (b(1 - s) + t(2s - 1)) |Now, the area of triangle ABC is:Area ABC = (1/2) | (0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0)) | = (1/2) | 4b d | = 2b dSo, the ratio of the areas is:Area A'B'C' / Area ABC = | d (b(1 - s) + t(2s - 1)) | / (2b d) = | (b(1 - s) + t(2s - 1)) | / (2b)We need to show that this ratio is ‚â§ 1/2.So, | (b(1 - s) + t(2s - 1)) | / (2b) ‚â§ 1/2Multiply both sides by 2b:| b(1 - s) + t(2s - 1) | ‚â§ bWhich simplifies to:| b(1 - s) + t(2s - 1) | ‚â§ bNow, since b > 0, we can divide both sides by b:| (1 - s) + (t/b)(2s - 1) | ‚â§ 1Let me denote t/b as another variable, say u, where 0 ‚â§ u ‚â§ 1 because t ranges from 0 to b.So, | (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) | ‚â§ 1We need to show that for 0 ‚â§ s ‚â§ 1 and 0 ‚â§ u ‚â§ 1, the expression inside the absolute value is between -1 and 1.Let me analyze the expression:E = (1 - s) + u(2s - 1)Let's consider the maximum and minimum values of E.First, consider E as a function of u:E(u) = (1 - s) + u(2s - 1)This is a linear function in u. Its maximum and minimum occur at the endpoints u=0 and u=1.At u=0: E = 1 - sAt u=1: E = (1 - s) + (2s - 1) = sSo, E ranges from 1 - s to s.Now, since 0 ‚â§ s ‚â§ 1, 1 - s ranges from 1 to 0, and s ranges from 0 to 1.Thus, E ranges from 0 to 1 when s is between 0 and 1.Wait, but if s is between 0 and 1, then 1 - s is between 0 and 1, and s is between 0 and 1. So, E ranges from 0 to 1.But we have the absolute value of E, so |E| ranges from 0 to 1.Therefore, |E| ‚â§ 1, which means that the ratio is ‚â§ 1/2.Hence, Area A'B'C' ‚â§ (1/2) Area ABC.Okay, that seems to work. So, part (a) is proved.Now, part (b) asks to prove that the area of triangle A'B'C' is equal to a quarter of the area of triangle ABC if and only if at least one of the points A' or C' coincides with the midpoint of the corresponding side.So, we need to show two things:1. If either A' is the midpoint of BC or C' is the midpoint of AB, then Area A'B'C' = (1/4) Area ABC.2. Conversely, if Area A'B'C' = (1/4) Area ABC, then at least one of A' or C' must be the midpoint of their respective sides.Let me tackle the first part.Assume that A' is the midpoint of BC. Then, A' would be at ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d). Similarly, if C' is the midpoint of AB, then C' would be at (b, 0).Let's first consider A' being the midpoint of BC.So, A' = (b + c, d)Then, the coordinates of A', B', and C' are:A' = (b + c, d)B' = (c, d)C' = (2t, 0)Wait, but if A' is the midpoint, then t is fixed? Or is t arbitrary? Wait, no, in this case, A' is fixed as the midpoint, but C' can still be any point on AB. Hmm, but in the problem statement, it's an \\"if and only if\\" condition, so we need to see when the area is exactly 1/4.Wait, maybe I need to set up the area expression again.From part (a), we have:Area A'B'C' / Area ABC = | (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) | / 2We need this to be equal to 1/4.So,| (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) | / 2 = 1/4Multiply both sides by 2:| (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) | = 1/2So,(1 - s) + u(2s - 1) = ¬±1/2But since all variables are between 0 and 1, let's see.Case 1: (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) = 1/2Case 2: (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) = -1/2But since (1 - s) and u(2s - 1) are real numbers, let's see if the second case is possible.Given that 0 ‚â§ s ‚â§ 1 and 0 ‚â§ u ‚â§ 1.If s = 0:Case 1: 1 + u(-1) = 1 - u = 1/2 ‚áí u = 1/2Case 2: 1 - u = -1/2 ‚áí u = 3/2, which is not possible since u ‚â§ 1.If s = 1:Case 1: 0 + u(1) = u = 1/2Case 2: 0 + u = -1/2 ‚áí u = -1/2, which is not possible.For 0 < s < 1:Let me solve for u in Case 1:(1 - s) + u(2s - 1) = 1/2u(2s - 1) = 1/2 - (1 - s) = s - 1/2So,u = (s - 1/2) / (2s - 1)Simplify denominator: 2s - 1 = 2(s - 1/2)So,u = (s - 1/2) / [2(s - 1/2)] = 1/2So, u = 1/2 regardless of s.Similarly, in Case 2:(1 - s) + u(2s - 1) = -1/2u(2s - 1) = -1/2 - (1 - s) = -3/2 + su = (-3/2 + s) / (2s - 1)But since 0 ‚â§ u ‚â§ 1, let's see if this is possible.Let me check for s = 1/2:u = (-3/2 + 1/2) / (1 - 1) = (-1)/0, undefined.For s > 1/2:Denominator 2s - 1 > 0Numerator -3/2 + s < 0 when s < 3/2, which is always true since s ‚â§ 1.So, u would be negative, which is not allowed.For s < 1/2:Denominator 2s - 1 < 0Numerator -3/2 + s < 0So, u = (negative)/(negative) = positiveBut let's see if u ‚â§ 1:u = (-3/2 + s) / (2s - 1)Let me set u = 1:(-3/2 + s) / (2s - 1) = 1-3/2 + s = 2s - 1-3/2 + 1 = ss = -1/2, which is not in [0,1]So, u cannot be 1 in this case.Therefore, the only solution is u = 1/2 in Case 1.So, regardless of s, u must be 1/2.Therefore, t/b = u = 1/2 ‚áí t = b/2So, C' must be at (2t, 0) = (b, 0), which is the midpoint of AB.Alternatively, if s = 1/2, then:From u = 1/2, which is always the case.Wait, but s can be anything, but u must be 1/2.So, regardless of where A' is on BC, as long as C' is the midpoint of AB, the area is 1/4.Similarly, if A' is the midpoint of BC, then s = 1/2.Wait, let's see.If A' is the midpoint of BC, then s = 1/2.So, plugging s = 1/2 into the area ratio:Area A'B'C' / Area ABC = | (1 - 1/2) + u(2*(1/2) - 1) | / 2 = | 1/2 + u(1 - 1) | / 2 = |1/2| / 2 = 1/4So, regardless of u, if A' is the midpoint, the area is 1/4.Wait, but earlier we saw that u must be 1/2 to get the area ratio 1/4. So, there seems to be a contradiction.Wait, no. If A' is the midpoint, then s = 1/2, and regardless of u, the area ratio is 1/4. But from the earlier analysis, to get the area ratio 1/4, u must be 1/2. So, if A' is the midpoint, then regardless of u, the area is 1/4, but if A' is not the midpoint, then u must be 1/2 to get the area ratio 1/4.Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me re-examine.From the area ratio expression:Area A'B'C' / Area ABC = | (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) | / 2We set this equal to 1/4, so:| (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) | = 1/2As we saw, this leads to u = 1/2 regardless of s, except when s = 1/2, in which case the expression becomes |1/2| = 1/2, which is always true, meaning that for s = 1/2, any u would satisfy the equation, but in reality, when s = 1/2, the area ratio is always 1/4 regardless of u.Wait, that can't be. Let me plug s = 1/2 into the area ratio:Area A'B'C' / Area ABC = | (1 - 1/2) + u(2*(1/2) - 1) | / 2 = |1/2 + u(1 - 1)| / 2 = |1/2| / 2 = 1/4So, indeed, when s = 1/2 (i.e., A' is the midpoint of BC), the area ratio is always 1/4, regardless of u (i.e., regardless of where C' is on AB). But wait, that contradicts the earlier conclusion that u must be 1/2.Wait, no, because when s = 1/2, the term involving u disappears, so the area ratio is fixed at 1/4 regardless of u. So, in this case, even if C' is not the midpoint, the area is still 1/4.But the problem statement says \\"if and only if at least one of the points A' or C' coincides with the midpoint of the corresponding side.\\"So, if A' is the midpoint, then regardless of C', the area is 1/4. Similarly, if C' is the midpoint, then regardless of A', the area is 1/4.Wait, let me check that.If C' is the midpoint of AB, then t = b, so u = t/b = 1.Plugging u = 1 into the area ratio:Area A'B'C' / Area ABC = | (1 - s) + 1*(2s - 1) | / 2 = |1 - s + 2s - 1| / 2 = |s| / 2But we need this to be 1/4, so |s| / 2 = 1/4 ‚áí |s| = 1/2Since s is between 0 and 1, s = 1/2.So, if C' is the midpoint, then to get the area ratio 1/4, A' must be the midpoint of BC.Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.Wait, let me clarify.If A' is the midpoint of BC, then s = 1/2, and the area ratio is 1/4 regardless of u (i.e., regardless of where C' is).If C' is the midpoint of AB, then u = 1/2, and the area ratio is 1/4 regardless of s (i.e., regardless of where A' is).Wait, no. From earlier, when C' is the midpoint, u = 1/2, and the area ratio is 1/4 regardless of s.But when A' is the midpoint, s = 1/2, and the area ratio is 1/4 regardless of u.So, in both cases, if either A' or C' is the midpoint, the area ratio is 1/4.Conversely, if the area ratio is 1/4, then either A' is the midpoint or C' is the midpoint.Because from the equation | (1 - s) + u(2s - 1) | = 1/2, the only solutions are when either s = 1/2 or u = 1/2.Thus, the area is 1/4 if and only if at least one of the points A' or C' is the midpoint of their respective sides.Therefore, part (b) is proved."},{"question":"If the sum and difference of two numbers are 5 and 10 respectively, what is the difference of their squares?","answer":"First, I identify the two numbers as ( x ) and ( y ) based on the given information.The sum of the numbers is 5, so I write the equation:[ x + y = 5 ]The difference of the numbers is 10, leading to the equation:[ x - y = 10 ]To find the difference of their squares, ( x^2 - y^2 ), I solve the system of equations. Adding the two equations eliminates ( y ):[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 10 ][ 2x = 15 ][ x = frac{15}{2} = 7.5 ]Next, I substitute ( x = 7.5 ) back into the first equation to find ( y ):[ 7.5 + y = 5 ][ y = 5 - 7.5 ][ y = -2.5 ]Finally, I calculate the difference of their squares:[ x^2 - y^2 = (7.5)^2 - (-2.5)^2 ][ x^2 - y^2 = 56.25 - 6.25 ][ x^2 - y^2 = 50 ]"},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = x - 1 + frac{a}{e^x}, where a in mathbb{R}.(I) If the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at the point (1, f(1)) is parallel to the x-axis, find the value of a.(II) Find the extreme values of the function f(x).(III) When a = 1, if the line l: y = kx - 1 does not intersect with the curve y = f(x), find the maximum value of k.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = x - 1 + a/e^x, and there are three parts to the problem. Let me try to tackle each part step by step.Starting with part (I): If the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at the point (1, f(1)) is parallel to the x-axis, find the value of a.Hmm, okay. I remember that if a tangent line is parallel to the x-axis, that means its slope is zero. So, I need to find the derivative of f(x) and set it equal to zero at x = 1. Let me compute the derivative.f(x) = x - 1 + a/e^x. The derivative f‚Äô(x) would be the derivative of x, which is 1, minus the derivative of 1, which is 0, plus the derivative of a/e^x. The derivative of a/e^x is a times the derivative of e^{-x}, which is -e^{-x}. So, f‚Äô(x) = 1 - a/e^x.So, f‚Äô(x) = 1 - a/e^x. Now, at x = 1, this derivative should be zero because the tangent is parallel to the x-axis.So, plugging x = 1 into f‚Äô(x):f‚Äô(1) = 1 - a/e^1 = 1 - a/e.Set this equal to zero:1 - a/e = 0.Solving for a:a/e = 1 => a = e.So, a is equal to e. That seems straightforward.Moving on to part (II): Find the extreme values of the function f(x).Extreme values occur where the derivative is zero or undefined. Since f(x) is defined for all real numbers, we just need to find where f‚Äô(x) = 0.From part (I), f‚Äô(x) = 1 - a/e^x. Setting this equal to zero:1 - a/e^x = 0 => a/e^x = 1 => e^x = a.So, x = ln(a). But wait, ln(a) is only defined if a > 0. So, if a is less than or equal to zero, then e^x = a has no solution because e^x is always positive. Therefore, if a <= 0, f‚Äô(x) is never zero, meaning f(x) has no critical points and thus no extreme values.But if a > 0, then x = ln(a) is a critical point. Now, we need to determine if this critical point is a minimum or maximum.Looking at the derivative f‚Äô(x) = 1 - a/e^x. Let's analyze the sign of f‚Äô(x):- For x < ln(a), e^x < a, so a/e^x > 1, which means f‚Äô(x) = 1 - a/e^x < 0. So, the function is decreasing on (-‚àû, ln(a)).- For x > ln(a), e^x > a, so a/e^x < 1, which means f‚Äô(x) = 1 - a/e^x > 0. So, the function is increasing on (ln(a), ‚àû).Therefore, at x = ln(a), the function changes from decreasing to increasing, which means it's a minimum point.So, the function f(x) has a minimum at x = ln(a) when a > 0, and no extreme values when a <= 0.Let me compute the value of f at x = ln(a):f(ln(a)) = ln(a) - 1 + a/e^{ln(a)}.But e^{ln(a)} = a, so this simplifies to:f(ln(a)) = ln(a) - 1 + a/a = ln(a) - 1 + 1 = ln(a).So, the minimum value is ln(a). There's no maximum value because as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity.Okay, that seems solid.Now, part (III): When a = 1, if the line l: y = kx - 1 does not intersect with the curve y = f(x), find the maximum value of k.Alright, so a = 1, so f(x) = x - 1 + 1/e^x. The line is y = kx - 1. We need to find the maximum k such that these two graphs do not intersect.So, setting f(x) equal to the line:x - 1 + 1/e^x = kx - 1.Let me rearrange this equation:x - 1 + 1/e^x - kx + 1 = 0.Simplify:(1 - k)x + 1/e^x = 0.So, (1 - k)x + e^{-x} = 0.Let me denote g(x) = (1 - k)x + e^{-x}. We need to find k such that g(x) = 0 has no real solutions.So, we need to find the maximum k where the equation g(x) = 0 has no solution.Alternatively, we can think of this as the line y = kx - 1 being above or below the curve y = f(x) for all x, depending on the value of k.But since f(x) = x - 1 + e^{-x}, and the line is y = kx - 1, the difference is f(x) - (kx - 1) = (1 - k)x + e^{-x}.So, if we want f(x) and the line not to intersect, then f(x) - (kx - 1) is always positive or always negative.But let's see. As x approaches infinity, f(x) behaves like x, and the line y = kx - 1 behaves like kx. So, if k > 1, then as x approaches infinity, kx - 1 grows faster than x, so the line would eventually be above f(x). Similarly, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) behaves like x, and the line y = kx - 1 behaves like kx. If k < 1, then as x approaches negative infinity, the line would be below f(x).Wait, maybe I need to analyze the function g(x) = (1 - k)x + e^{-x}.We need g(x) > 0 for all x, or g(x) < 0 for all x.But since e^{-x} is always positive, and (1 - k)x can be positive or negative depending on x and k.If k > 1, then (1 - k)x is negative for positive x, and positive for negative x.But e^{-x} is positive for all x.So, let's consider k > 1. Then, for x positive, (1 - k)x is negative, and e^{-x} is positive. So, g(x) could be positive or negative depending on the balance.Similarly, for x negative, (1 - k)x is positive because x is negative and (1 - k) is negative, so positive times negative is positive. And e^{-x} is also positive because x is negative, so e^{-x} is large.So, for x negative, g(x) is positive because both terms are positive.But for x positive, g(x) = (1 - k)x + e^{-x}. Since k > 1, (1 - k)x is negative, and e^{-x} is positive but decreasing.So, as x increases, (1 - k)x becomes more negative, while e^{-x} decreases towards zero. So, g(x) could cross zero somewhere.Similarly, for k < 1, (1 - k)x is positive for x positive, negative for x negative.So, for x positive, g(x) is positive because both terms are positive. For x negative, (1 - k)x is negative, and e^{-x} is positive. So, g(x) could be positive or negative.Wait, maybe I need to find when g(x) = 0 has no solution.So, if k = 1, then g(x) = 0 + e^{-x} = e^{-x}, which is always positive. So, g(x) = e^{-x} > 0 for all x. So, when k = 1, the equation g(x) = 0 has no solution.If k > 1, let's see. For example, take k = 2. Then g(x) = (1 - 2)x + e^{-x} = -x + e^{-x}. Let's see if this ever equals zero.At x = 0, g(0) = 0 + 1 = 1 > 0.As x approaches infinity, -x dominates, so g(x) approaches -infty.As x approaches negative infinity, -x becomes positive infinity, and e^{-x} also becomes positive infinity. So, g(x) approaches positive infinity.So, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, since g(x) goes from positive infinity to 1 at x = 0, and then to negative infinity as x approaches infinity, there must be some x where g(x) = 0. So, for k > 1, the equation g(x) = 0 has at least one solution.Similarly, if k < 1, say k = 0, then g(x) = x + e^{-x}. At x = -infty, x approaches -infty, e^{-x} approaches infty, but x dominates, so g(x) approaches -infty. At x = 0, g(0) = 0 + 1 = 1. So, again, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some x where g(x) = 0.Wait, so for k < 1, g(x) goes from -infty to positive values, so it must cross zero.But when k = 1, g(x) = e^{-x} > 0 for all x, so no solution.Therefore, the maximum value of k where the line does not intersect the curve is k = 1.Wait, but let me double-check. If k = 1, then the line is y = x - 1, and f(x) = x - 1 + e^{-x}. So, f(x) - (x - 1) = e^{-x} > 0 for all x. So, the curve is always above the line y = x - 1, so they never intersect.If k is slightly more than 1, say k = 1 + Œµ, then the line is steeper, and as x increases, the line will eventually overtake f(x), so they must intersect somewhere.Similarly, if k is less than 1, the line is less steep, but as x approaches negative infinity, the line y = kx -1 will go to negative infinity, while f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x} approaches negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity, but the e^{-x} term becomes large positive. Wait, no, as x approaches negative infinity, e^{-x} = e^{|x|} which goes to infinity. So, f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x} approaches infinity as x approaches negative infinity because e^{-x} dominates.Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me clarify.As x approaches negative infinity:f(x) = x - 1 + e^{-x} ‚âà e^{-x} because e^{-x} grows exponentially as x becomes more negative, while x -1 is linear.So, f(x) approaches positive infinity as x approaches negative infinity.Similarly, the line y = kx -1, as x approaches negative infinity, if k ‚â† 0, will approach negative infinity if k > 0, or positive infinity if k < 0.Wait, so if k > 0, as x approaches negative infinity, y = kx -1 approaches negative infinity, while f(x) approaches positive infinity. So, they must cross somewhere.If k < 0, then y = kx -1 approaches positive infinity as x approaches negative infinity, but f(x) also approaches positive infinity. So, depending on the slope, they might or might not intersect.But in our case, a = 1, so f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x}.Wait, maybe I need to consider the behavior more carefully.But in part (III), we are to find the maximum k such that the line y = kx -1 does not intersect f(x). From the earlier analysis, when k = 1, the line y = x -1 is always below f(x), as f(x) - (x -1) = e^{-x} > 0.If k > 1, then as x increases, the line y = kx -1 will eventually overtake f(x), so they must intersect.If k < 1, then as x approaches negative infinity, the line y = kx -1 will approach negative infinity if k > 0, while f(x) approaches positive infinity, so they must intersect somewhere.Wait, but if k is negative, say k = -1, then y = -x -1. As x approaches negative infinity, y approaches positive infinity, and f(x) also approaches positive infinity. So, maybe they don't intersect? Wait, no, because f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x}, and as x approaches negative infinity, e^{-x} dominates, so f(x) ~ e^{-x}, which is much larger than y = -x -1, which is linear. So, f(x) grows much faster than the line as x approaches negative infinity, so they might not intersect? Wait, but as x approaches positive infinity, f(x) ~ x, and y = -x -1 ~ -x, so f(x) is positive and y is negative, so they don't intersect there either. Hmm, but in the middle, maybe they cross?Wait, let me test k = -1.Set f(x) = -x -1:x -1 + e^{-x} = -x -12x + e^{-x} = 0So, 2x + e^{-x} = 0.At x = 0: 0 + 1 = 1 > 0.As x approaches negative infinity: 2x approaches -infty, e^{-x} approaches infty. So, 2x + e^{-x} approaches infty? Wait, no, because e^{-x} = e^{|x|}, which grows faster than linear. So, as x approaches negative infinity, 2x + e^{-x} approaches infty.Wait, but at x = 0, it's 1, and as x approaches negative infinity, it approaches infty. So, does it ever cross zero? Let's see.Take x = -1: 2*(-1) + e^{1} = -2 + e ‚âà -2 + 2.718 ‚âà 0.718 > 0.x = -2: 2*(-2) + e^{2} ‚âà -4 + 7.389 ‚âà 3.389 > 0.x = -0.5: 2*(-0.5) + e^{0.5} ‚âà -1 + 1.648 ‚âà 0.648 > 0.x = -0.1: 2*(-0.1) + e^{0.1} ‚âà -0.2 + 1.105 ‚âà 0.905 > 0.So, it seems that for k = -1, g(x) = 2x + e^{-x} is always positive. So, the equation g(x) = 0 has no solution.Wait, but earlier I thought that for k < 1, the line might intersect, but in this case, for k = -1, it doesn't intersect. So, maybe the maximum k is not 1, but higher?Wait, no, because when k = 1, the line is y = x -1, and f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x}, so f(x) is always above the line. For k > 1, the line is steeper, so it will eventually overtake f(x) as x increases, causing an intersection. For k < 1, depending on k, the line might or might not intersect.Wait, but in the case of k = -1, the line is y = -x -1, and f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x}. As x approaches positive infinity, f(x) ~ x, and y ~ -x, so f(x) is positive and y is negative, so no intersection there. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) ~ e^{-x} which is positive infinity, and y ~ -x which is positive infinity, but f(x) grows much faster. So, maybe for k < 1, depending on k, the line might not intersect f(x).But in the problem, we are to find the maximum value of k such that the line does not intersect f(x). So, the maximum k is 1, because for k > 1, the line intersects f(x), and for k <= 1, it doesn't.Wait, but earlier when I took k = -1, the line didn't intersect f(x). So, maybe the maximum k is 1, but the minimum k could be lower.But the question is asking for the maximum value of k such that the line does not intersect f(x). So, the maximum k is 1.Wait, but let me think again. If k = 1, the line is y = x -1, and f(x) is always above it. For k > 1, the line is steeper, so it will intersect f(x) somewhere. For k < 1, the line is less steep, but depending on k, it might or might not intersect.Wait, but in the case of k = 0, the line is y = -1, and f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x}. So, f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x} is always above y = -1 because e^{-x} > 0 for all x. So, f(x) - (-1) = x + e^{-x} > 0 for all x. So, the line y = -1 does not intersect f(x).Similarly, for k = 0.5, the line is y = 0.5x -1. Let's see if they intersect.Set f(x) = 0.5x -1:x -1 + e^{-x} = 0.5x -10.5x + e^{-x} = 0So, 0.5x + e^{-x} = 0.At x = 0: 0 + 1 = 1 > 0.As x approaches negative infinity: 0.5x approaches -infty, e^{-x} approaches infty. So, 0.5x + e^{-x} approaches infty.As x approaches positive infinity: 0.5x approaches infty, e^{-x} approaches 0, so 0.5x + e^{-x} approaches infty.Wait, but does it ever cross zero?Let me check x = -2: 0.5*(-2) + e^{2} ‚âà -1 + 7.389 ‚âà 6.389 > 0.x = -1: 0.5*(-1) + e^{1} ‚âà -0.5 + 2.718 ‚âà 2.218 > 0.x = -0.5: 0.5*(-0.5) + e^{0.5} ‚âà -0.25 + 1.648 ‚âà 1.398 > 0.x = -0.1: 0.5*(-0.1) + e^{0.1} ‚âà -0.05 + 1.105 ‚âà 1.055 > 0.x = 0: 0 + 1 = 1 > 0.x = 1: 0.5 + e^{-1} ‚âà 0.5 + 0.368 ‚âà 0.868 > 0.x = 2: 1 + e^{-2} ‚âà 1 + 0.135 ‚âà 1.135 > 0.So, it seems that for k = 0.5, the equation g(x) = 0.5x + e^{-x} = 0 has no solution. So, the line y = 0.5x -1 does not intersect f(x).Wait, but earlier I thought that for k < 1, the line might intersect, but in reality, for k = 0.5, it doesn't. So, maybe the maximum k is 1, but for k < 1, it might or might not intersect depending on k.Wait, but the problem is asking for the maximum value of k such that the line does not intersect f(x). So, the maximum k is 1, because for k > 1, the line intersects f(x), and for k <= 1, it doesn't.Wait, but when k = 1, the line is y = x -1, and f(x) = x -1 + e^{-x}, so f(x) is always above the line. For k > 1, the line is steeper, so it will eventually overtake f(x) as x increases, causing an intersection. For k < 1, the line is less steep, and depending on k, it might not intersect f(x).But in the case of k = 0.5, the line does not intersect f(x). So, the maximum k is 1, because beyond that, the line intersects f(x). So, the answer is k = 1.Wait, but let me think again. If k is greater than 1, the line intersects f(x). If k is less than or equal to 1, the line does not intersect f(x). So, the maximum value of k is 1.Yes, that makes sense."},{"question":"Quadratic trinomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) are such that ( f^{prime}(x) g^{prime}(x) geq |f(x)| + |g(x)| ) for all real ( x ).Prove that the product ( f(x) g(x) ) is equal to the square of some trinomial.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about quadratic trinomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ).

I need to prove that the product ( f(x)g(x) ) is equal to the square of some trinomial. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let me recall what a quadratic trinomial looks like. A general quadratic trinomial can be written as ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), where ( a neq 0 ). Similarly, ( g(x) = dx^2 + ex + f ), with ( d neq 0 ). Their derivatives would then be ( f'(x) = 2ax + b ) and ( g'(x) = 2dx + e ).The condition given is ( f'(x)g'(x) geq |f(x)| + |g(x)| ) for all real ( x ). That seems quite strong because it's saying that the product of the derivatives is always at least as large as the sum of the absolute values of the functions themselves. I wonder what kind of quadratics would satisfy this.Maybe it would help to consider specific forms of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ). Since they are quadratics, their graphs are parabolas. The derivatives ( f'(x) ) and ( g'(x) ) are linear functions, so their product is a quadratic function. The right-hand side, ( |f(x)| + |g(x)| ), is the sum of the absolute values of two quadratics, which can be more complicated, but perhaps there's a way to relate them.Let me think about the vertex form of a quadratic. If I write ( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k ) and ( g(x) = d(x - l)^2 + m ), then their derivatives are ( f'(x) = 2a(x - h) ) and ( g'(x) = 2d(x - l) ). The product ( f'(x)g'(x) ) would then be ( 4ad(x - h)(x - l) ). So the inequality becomes:[4ad(x - h)(x - l) geq |a(x - h)^2 + k| + |d(x - l)^2 + m|]for all real ( x ).This seems a bit messy, but maybe I can analyze specific points. For example, let's consider ( x = h ). Plugging that in, the left-hand side becomes ( 4ad(h - h)(h - l) = 0 ). The right-hand side becomes ( |a(0)^2 + k| + |d(h - l)^2 + m| = |k| + |d(h - l)^2 + m| ). So, ( 0 geq |k| + |d(h - l)^2 + m| ). Since absolute values are non-negative, this implies that both ( |k| = 0 ) and ( |d(h - l)^2 + m| = 0 ). Therefore, ( k = 0 ) and ( d(h - l)^2 + m = 0 ).Similarly, if I plug in ( x = l ), the left-hand side becomes ( 4ad(l - h)(l - l) = 0 ), and the right-hand side becomes ( |a(l - h)^2 + k| + |d(0)^2 + m| = |a(l - h)^2 + k| + |m| ). Again, since ( 0 geq |a(l - h)^2 + k| + |m| ), both terms must be zero. So, ( a(l - h)^2 + k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ).Wait a minute, from ( k = 0 ) and ( m = 0 ), we have ( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 ) and ( g(x) = d(x - l)^2 ). Also, from ( d(h - l)^2 + m = 0 ) and ( a(l - h)^2 + k = 0 ), since ( m = 0 ) and ( k = 0 ), we get ( d(h - l)^2 = 0 ) and ( a(l - h)^2 = 0 ). But ( (h - l)^2 ) is the same as ( (l - h)^2 ), so unless ( h = l ), ( d ) and ( a ) would have to be zero, which contradicts the fact that they are quadratic trinomials (so ( a ) and ( d ) can't be zero). Therefore, ( h = l ).So, both parabolas have the same vertex at ( x = h = l ). Therefore, ( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 ) and ( g(x) = d(x - h)^2 ). Now, the product ( f(x)g(x) = a d (x - h)^4 ). Hmm, but the problem says it should be the square of some trinomial. A trinomial is a polynomial with three terms, but ( (x - h)^4 ) is a monomial. Wait, but if I write ( (x - h)^4 ) as ( [(x - h)^2]^2 ), then it's the square of a quadratic trinomial if ( (x - h)^2 ) is considered a trinomial. But ( (x - h)^2 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2 ), which is indeed a trinomial.So, ( f(x)g(x) = ( sqrt{a d} (x - h)^2 )^2 ), which is the square of the trinomial ( sqrt{a d} (x - h)^2 ). But wait, ( sqrt{a d} ) must be real, so ( a d ) must be non-negative. From the original condition, since ( f'(x)g'(x) geq |f(x)| + |g(x)| ), and ( f'(x)g'(x) = 4 a d (x - h)^2 ), which is always non-negative because it's a square times ( 4 a d ). Therefore, ( a d ) must be positive, so ( sqrt{a d} ) is real.Therefore, ( f(x)g(x) ) is indeed the square of the trinomial ( sqrt{a d} (x - h)^2 ).Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \\"the square of some trinomial.\\" So, I need to make sure that ( sqrt{a d} (x - h)^2 ) is a trinomial. Well, ( (x - h)^2 ) is a trinomial when expanded, as I mentioned earlier: ( x^2 - 2hx + h^2 ). So, multiplying by ( sqrt{a d} ) just scales it, but it's still a trinomial. Therefore, ( f(x)g(x) ) is the square of this trinomial.So, putting it all together, by analyzing the given condition at specific points and deducing the forms of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ), I concluded that their product must be a perfect square of a quadratic trinomial. That seems to satisfy the problem's requirement.I think I covered all the necessary steps, but let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. Starting from the given inequality, I considered specific values of ( x ) to find constraints on the constants in the quadratic functions. This led me to conclude that both quadratics must have the same vertex and that their constants must be zero. Then, by expressing their product, I showed it's the square of another quadratic trinomial. Yeah, that seems solid.I guess the key insight was plugging in ( x = h ) and ( x = l ) to simplify the inequality and find that the constants had to be zero, forcing both quadratics to have the same vertex. From there, it was just a matter of expressing the product as a square.**Final Answer**boxed{(f(x)g(x)) = left( sqrt{ac}(x - u)^2 right)^2}"},{"question":"Let  a,b,c  be the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and  alpha, beta, gamma  respectively, the angles opposite these sides. Prove that if [ a+b=tan{frac{gamma}{2}}(atan{alpha}+btan{beta}) ] the triangle is isosceles.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a triangle with sides a, b, c opposite angles Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ respectively. The condition given is:[ a + b = tan{frac{gamma}{2}}(a tan{alpha} + b tan{beta}) ]And I need to prove that the triangle is isosceles. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in a triangle, if it's isosceles, two sides are equal, which means the angles opposite those sides are also equal. So, if I can show that either a = b, a = c, or b = c, then the triangle is isosceles. Since the equation involves a and b, maybe I can show that a = b.Let me recall some trigonometric identities related to triangles. The tangent of half an angle can be expressed in terms of the sides. I think the formula is:[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{(s - a)(s - b)}{s(s - c)} ]Where s is the semi-perimeter, ( s = frac{a + b + c}{2} ). But I'm not sure if that's the most useful here.Alternatively, I remember that in terms of the inradius (r) and the semi-perimeter (s), we have:[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{r}{s - c} ]But again, I'm not sure if that directly helps.Wait, maybe I should use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines relates the sides and angles of a triangle:[ frac{a}{sin{alpha}} = frac{b}{sin{beta}} = frac{c}{sin{gamma}} = 2R ]Where R is the circumradius. Maybe expressing a and b in terms of R and the sines of their opposite angles could help.Let me try that. So,[ a = 2R sin{alpha} ][ b = 2R sin{beta} ]So, substituting these into the given equation:[ 2R sin{alpha} + 2R sin{beta} = tan{frac{gamma}{2}} left( 2R sin{alpha} tan{alpha} + 2R sin{beta} tan{beta} right) ]Simplify both sides by dividing by 2R:[ sin{alpha} + sin{beta} = tan{frac{gamma}{2}} left( sin{alpha} tan{alpha} + sin{beta} tan{beta} right) ]Hmm, okay. Let me compute the right-hand side.First, note that ( sin{alpha} tan{alpha} = sin{alpha} cdot frac{sin{alpha}}{cos{alpha}} = frac{sin^2{alpha}}{cos{alpha}} ). Similarly for Œ≤.So, the right-hand side becomes:[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} left( frac{sin^2{alpha}}{cos{alpha}} + frac{sin^2{beta}}{cos{beta}} right) ]So, the equation is:[ sin{alpha} + sin{beta} = tan{frac{gamma}{2}} left( frac{sin^2{alpha}}{cos{alpha}} + frac{sin^2{beta}}{cos{beta}} right) ]Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should express everything in terms of half-angle formulas. Let me recall that:[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{sin{gamma}}{1 + cos{gamma}} ]But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Wait, another approach: maybe express tan(Œ≥/2) in terms of the sides. There's a formula for tan(Œ≥/2) in terms of the sides of the triangle.Yes, in terms of the semi-perimeter s, we have:[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{(s - a)(s - b)}{s(s - c)} ]But I'm not sure if that's helpful here because it introduces more variables.Alternatively, maybe I can express tan(Œ≥/2) in terms of tan(Œ±) and tan(Œ≤). Since in a triangle, Œ± + Œ≤ + Œ≥ = œÄ, so Œ≥ = œÄ - Œ± - Œ≤. Therefore, Œ≥/2 = œÄ/2 - (Œ± + Œ≤)/2.So,[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = tan{left( frac{pi}{2} - frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} = cot{left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} ]And,[ cot{left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} = frac{1}{tan{left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)}} ]But I don't know if that's helpful yet.Wait, maybe I can use the formula for tan(A + B). Since Œ± + Œ≤ = œÄ - Œ≥, so:[ tan{(alpha + beta)} = tan{(pi - gamma)} = -tan{gamma} ]But,[ tan{(alpha + beta)} = frac{tan{alpha} + tan{beta}}{1 - tan{alpha}tan{beta}} = -tan{gamma} ]So,[ frac{tan{alpha} + tan{beta}}{1 - tan{alpha}tan{beta}} = -tan{gamma} ]Which gives:[ tan{alpha} + tan{beta} = -tan{gamma}(1 - tan{alpha}tan{beta}) ]But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.Wait, going back to the equation we had earlier:[ sin{alpha} + sin{beta} = tan{frac{gamma}{2}} left( frac{sin^2{alpha}}{cos{alpha}} + frac{sin^2{beta}}{cos{beta}} right) ]Let me compute the right-hand side:First, compute ( frac{sin^2{alpha}}{cos{alpha}} + frac{sin^2{beta}}{cos{beta}} ). Let me write this as:[ sin{alpha} tan{alpha} + sin{beta} tan{beta} ]Which is what we had before.So, let me denote:[ S = sin{alpha} + sin{beta} ][ T = sin{alpha} tan{alpha} + sin{beta} tan{beta} ]So, the equation is:[ S = tan{frac{gamma}{2}} cdot T ]Hmm. Maybe I can express S and T in terms of other trigonometric functions.Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution variables. Let me set:Let ( x = tan{frac{alpha}{2}} ) and ( y = tan{frac{beta}{2}} ). Then, using the double-angle formulas, we have:[ tan{alpha} = frac{2x}{1 - x^2} ][ tan{beta} = frac{2y}{1 - y^2} ]Also, ( sin{alpha} = frac{2x}{1 + x^2} ) and ( sin{beta} = frac{2y}{1 + y^2} ).Similarly, ( tan{frac{gamma}{2}} ) can be expressed in terms of x and y. Since in a triangle, ( alpha + beta + gamma = pi ), so ( gamma = pi - alpha - beta ). Therefore,[ frac{gamma}{2} = frac{pi}{2} - frac{alpha + beta}{2} ]So,[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = cot{left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} ]Using the formula for cotangent of a sum:[ cot{left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right)} = frac{1 - tan{frac{alpha}{2}} tan{frac{beta}{2}}}{tan{frac{alpha}{2}} + tan{frac{beta}{2}}} = frac{1 - xy}{x + y} ]So, ( tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{1 - xy}{x + y} ).Okay, so now, let's express S and T in terms of x and y.First, ( S = sin{alpha} + sin{beta} = frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} ).Second, ( T = sin{alpha} tan{alpha} + sin{beta} tan{beta} = frac{2x}{1 + x^2} cdot frac{2x}{1 - x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} cdot frac{2y}{1 - y^2} ).Simplify T:[ T = frac{4x^2}{(1 + x^2)(1 - x^2)} + frac{4y^2}{(1 + y^2)(1 - y^2)} ]Note that ( (1 + x^2)(1 - x^2) = 1 - x^4 ), so:[ T = frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} ]So, now, going back to the equation:[ S = tan{frac{gamma}{2}} cdot T ]Substituting the expressions:[ frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} = frac{1 - xy}{x + y} left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe we can simplify it.First, let's factor the denominators on the right-hand side:Note that ( 1 - x^4 = (1 - x^2)(1 + x^2) ), so:[ frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} = frac{4x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} = frac{4x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} ]Similarly for y.So, the right-hand side becomes:[ frac{1 - xy}{x + y} left( frac{4x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{4y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Let me write this as:[ frac{1 - xy}{x + y} cdot left( frac{4x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{4y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Hmm, perhaps I can factor out the 4:[ frac{1 - xy}{x + y} cdot 4 left( frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]But I'm not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I can combine the fractions:Let me compute the sum inside the parentheses:[ frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} = frac{x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{y^2}{1 - y^4} ]Which is the same as:[ frac{x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{y^2}{1 - y^4} ]So, the right-hand side is:[ frac{1 - xy}{x + y} cdot 4 left( frac{x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Hmm, maybe I can write 1 - x^4 as (1 - x^2)(1 + x^2), but I don't see an immediate simplification.Alternatively, perhaps I can cross-multiply and see if I can find a relationship between x and y.Let me write the equation again:[ frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} = frac{1 - xy}{x + y} cdot left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Let me denote the left-hand side as L and the right-hand side as R.So,[ L = frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} ][ R = frac{1 - xy}{x + y} cdot left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Let me compute R step by step.First, compute ( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} ):[ frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} = 4 left( frac{x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Let me factor the denominators:[ 1 - x^4 = (1 - x^2)(1 + x^2) ][ 1 - y^4 = (1 - y^2)(1 + y^2) ]So,[ frac{x^2}{1 - x^4} = frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} = frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} ][ frac{y^2}{1 - y^4} = frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} ]So,[ frac{x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{y^2}{1 - y^4} = frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} ]Hmm, perhaps I can combine these two fractions over a common denominator, but that might get messy.Alternatively, maybe I can express them in terms of x and y:Wait, another idea: since x = tan(Œ±/2) and y = tan(Œ≤/2), and in a triangle, Œ± + Œ≤ + Œ≥ = œÄ, so Œ≥ = œÄ - Œ± - Œ≤. Maybe there's a relationship between x and y.Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the triangle is isosceles and see if the equation holds, but that might not be the right approach.Wait, actually, I need to prove that the triangle is isosceles given the equation. So, perhaps I can manipulate the equation to show that x = y, which would imply Œ± = Œ≤, hence a = b.So, let me try to manipulate the equation to see if x must equal y.So, starting from:[ frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} = frac{1 - xy}{x + y} cdot left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Let me multiply both sides by (x + y):[ (x + y) left( frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} right) = (1 - xy) left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Let me compute the left-hand side:[ (x + y) left( frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} right) = 2x(x + y) cdot frac{1}{1 + x^2} + 2y(x + y) cdot frac{1}{1 + y^2} ]Similarly, the right-hand side:[ (1 - xy) left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) = 4x^2(1 - xy) cdot frac{1}{1 - x^4} + 4y^2(1 - xy) cdot frac{1}{1 - y^4} ]This is getting quite involved. Maybe I can find a common term or factor.Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use substitution. Let me assume that x = y, which would imply Œ± = Œ≤, hence a = b, making the triangle isosceles. Let me see if the equation holds when x = y.If x = y, then:Left-hand side:[ frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = frac{4x}{1 + x^2} ]Right-hand side:[ frac{1 - x^2}{2x} cdot left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} right) = frac{1 - x^2}{2x} cdot frac{8x^2}{1 - x^4} ]Simplify:[ frac{1 - x^2}{2x} cdot frac{8x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} = frac{1 - x^2}{2x} cdot frac{8x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} ]Cancel out (1 - x^2):[ frac{8x^2}{2x(1 + x^2)} = frac{4x}{1 + x^2} ]Which equals the left-hand side. So, when x = y, the equation holds. So, at least in that case, it's valid.But I need to show that x must equal y for the equation to hold, not just that it holds when x = y.So, perhaps I can consider the difference between the two sides and show that it's zero only when x = y.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the equation as a function of x and y and show that the only solution is x = y.Alternatively, maybe I can use inequalities. Let me think.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can write the equation in terms of x and y and then manipulate it to find that x must equal y.Let me write the equation again:[ (x + y) left( frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} right) = (1 - xy) left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Let me denote A = x + y, B = 2x/(1 + x^2) + 2y/(1 + y^2), C = 1 - xy, D = 4x^2/(1 - x^4) + 4y^2/(1 - y^4). So, the equation is A*B = C*D.But this might not help directly.Alternatively, perhaps I can cross-multiply and bring everything to one side.Let me write:[ (x + y) left( frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} right) - (1 - xy) left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) = 0 ]This is a complicated expression, but maybe I can factor it or find a common term.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider specific substitutions or assume x ‚â† y and reach a contradiction.Wait, another idea: maybe I can express everything in terms of x and y and then see if the equation simplifies to something that implies x = y.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the sides are positive, and the angles are between 0 and œÄ, so x and y are positive real numbers.Wait, maybe I can consider the function f(t) = 2t/(1 + t^2) and g(t) = 4t^2/(1 - t^4). Then, the equation becomes:[ (x + y)(f(x) + f(y)) = (1 - xy)(g(x) + g(y)) ]But I'm not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of the two sides.Let me compute the ratio R/L:[ frac{R}{L} = frac{(1 - xy)(g(x) + g(y))}{(x + y)(f(x) + f(y))} ]But I don't know if that helps.Wait, perhaps I can consider the case where x ‚â† y and see if the equation can hold.Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz, but I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can express the equation in terms of x and y and then consider the difference when x ‚â† y.Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:[ (x + y)(2x/(1 + x^2) + 2y/(1 + y^2)) = (1 - xy)(4x^2/(1 - x^4) + 4y^2/(1 - y^4)) ]Let me compute both sides:Left-hand side:[ (x + y) left( frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} right) ]Right-hand side:[ (1 - xy) left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Let me compute the right-hand side first:Note that ( 1 - x^4 = (1 - x^2)(1 + x^2) ), so:[ frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} = frac{4x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} = frac{4x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} ]Similarly for y.So, the right-hand side becomes:[ (1 - xy) left( frac{4x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{4y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Let me factor out the 4:[ 4(1 - xy) left( frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Now, let me write the left-hand side:[ (x + y) left( frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} right) = 2(x + y) left( frac{x}{1 + x^2} + frac{y}{1 + y^2} right) ]Hmm, perhaps I can write both sides in terms of similar fractions.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can write the left-hand side as:[ 2(x + y) left( frac{x}{1 + x^2} + frac{y}{1 + y^2} right) = 2 left( frac{x(x + y)}{1 + x^2} + frac{y(x + y)}{1 + y^2} right) ]Similarly, the right-hand side is:[ 4(1 - xy) left( frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Hmm, maybe I can factor out terms.Wait, perhaps I can write the right-hand side as:[ 4(1 - xy) left( frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) = 4 left( frac{x^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Hmm, I'm not seeing a clear path here. Maybe I need to consider specific substitutions or look for symmetry.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can set x = y and see if the equation holds, which it does, as we saw earlier. Now, suppose x ‚â† y, can the equation still hold?Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the function f(x, y) = L - R and show that f(x, y) = 0 only when x = y.But this might be complicated.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the angles Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ are related, so x and y are not independent variables.Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the sum of angles is œÄ, so Œ≥ = œÄ - Œ± - Œ≤. Therefore, we can express Œ≥ in terms of Œ± and Œ≤.But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the sides are related by the Law of Cosines:[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos{gamma} ]But I don't know if that's helpful here.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can express everything in terms of the semi-perimeter and inradius, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the equation as a quadratic in x and y and see if the only solution is x = y.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation as symmetric in x and y, so the only solution is x = y.Wait, let me think about that. If the equation is symmetric in x and y, then any solution where x ‚â† y would imply another solution where y ‚â† x, but since the equation is symmetric, the only solution is x = y.But I'm not sure if that's rigorous.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation as a function and show that it's minimized or maximized when x = y.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or AM-GM inequality to show that the equation holds only when x = y.Wait, let me try to consider the equation:[ (x + y) left( frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} right) = (1 - xy) left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Let me denote:Let me compute the left-hand side:[ (x + y) left( frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} right) = 2x(x + y)/(1 + x^2) + 2y(x + y)/(1 + y^2) ]Similarly, the right-hand side:[ (1 - xy) left( frac{4x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) = 4x^2(1 - xy)/(1 - x^4) + 4y^2(1 - xy)/(1 - y^4) ]Hmm, perhaps I can factor out terms:Note that ( 1 - x^4 = (1 - x^2)(1 + x^2) ), so:[ frac{x^2(1 - xy)}{1 - x^4} = frac{x^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} ]Similarly for y.So, the right-hand side becomes:[ 4 left( frac{x^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Now, let me write both sides:Left-hand side:[ 2x(x + y)/(1 + x^2) + 2y(x + y)/(1 + y^2) ]Right-hand side:[ 4 left( frac{x^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Hmm, perhaps I can factor out terms:Let me factor out 2 from the left-hand side:[ 2 left( frac{x(x + y)}{1 + x^2} + frac{y(x + y)}{1 + y^2} right) ]Similarly, the right-hand side is 4 times something.Wait, maybe I can divide both sides by 2:[ frac{x(x + y)}{1 + x^2} + frac{y(x + y)}{1 + y^2} = 2 left( frac{x^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2(1 - xy)}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Hmm, perhaps I can write the right-hand side as:[ 2(1 - xy) left( frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} + frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} right) ]Now, let me consider the terms inside the parentheses:[ frac{x^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 + x^2)} = frac{x^2}{1 - x^4} ][ frac{y^2}{(1 - y^2)(1 + y^2)} = frac{y^2}{1 - y^4} ]So, the right-hand side is:[ 2(1 - xy) left( frac{x^2}{1 - x^4} + frac{y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Hmm, perhaps I can write the left-hand side in terms of similar denominators.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can express the left-hand side as:[ frac{x(x + y)}{1 + x^2} = frac{x^2 + xy}{1 + x^2} = x - frac{x(1 - y)}{1 + x^2} ]But I'm not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps I can write:[ frac{x(x + y)}{1 + x^2} = x cdot frac{x + y}{1 + x^2} ]Similarly for y.Hmm, perhaps I can write the left-hand side as:[ x cdot frac{x + y}{1 + x^2} + y cdot frac{x + y}{1 + y^2} ]But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can consider the function f(t) = t/(1 + t^2), which is increasing for t > 0 up to t = 1, then decreasing. But I'm not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the function f(t) = t^2/(1 - t^4), which is also positive for t > 0.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if x ‚â† y, then the terms on the left and right would not balance.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values. For example, suppose x = 1, then y would have to satisfy the equation. Let me try x = 1.If x = 1, then:Left-hand side:[ frac{2*1}{1 + 1} + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} = 1 + frac{2y}{1 + y^2} ]Right-hand side:[ frac{1 - y}{1 + y} cdot left( frac{4*1}{1 - 1} + frac{4y^2}{1 - y^4} right) ]Wait, but 1 - 1 = 0, so the first term in the right-hand side becomes undefined. So, x cannot be 1 because tan(Œ±/2) = 1 implies Œ± = œÄ/2, which would make Œ≥ = œÄ - Œ± - Œ≤ = œÄ/2 - Œ≤, but then tan(Œ≥/2) would be defined, but the right-hand side would involve division by zero. So, x = 1 is not allowed.Similarly, x cannot be such that 1 - x^4 = 0, so x ‚â† 1.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can consider the case where x ‚â† y and see if the equation can hold.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that if x ‚â† y, then the left-hand side is greater than or less than the right-hand side, leading to a contradiction.Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the sides and angles are related, so maybe I can express the equation in terms of the sides and use the Law of Sines or Cosines.Wait, going back to the original equation:[ a + b = tan{frac{gamma}{2}}(a tan{alpha} + b tan{beta}) ]Let me express tan(Œ≥/2) in terms of the sides. There's a formula:[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{(s - a)(s - b)}{s(s - c)} ]Where s is the semi-perimeter, ( s = frac{a + b + c}{2} ).Similarly, tan(Œ±) and tan(Œ≤) can be expressed in terms of the sides.But this might complicate things further.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for tan(Œ≥/2) in terms of the inradius (r) and semi-perimeter (s):[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{r}{s - c} ]Similarly, tan(Œ±) = r / (s - a), tan(Œ≤) = r / (s - b).Wait, that's a useful relation. Let me recall that in a triangle:[ tan{frac{alpha}{2}} = frac{r}{s - a} ][ tan{frac{beta}{2}} = frac{r}{s - b} ][ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{r}{s - c} ]So, tan(Œ±) = 2 tan(Œ±/2) / (1 - tan^2(Œ±/2)) = 2*(r/(s - a)) / (1 - (r/(s - a))^2 )Similarly for tan(Œ≤) and tan(Œ≥).But this might not directly help.Wait, but if I use the formula for tan(Œ≥/2) as r/(s - c), and tan(Œ±) = 2 tan(Œ±/2)/(1 - tan^2(Œ±/2)) = 2*(r/(s - a))/(1 - (r/(s - a))^2 )Similarly for tan(Œ≤).But this seems complicated.Wait, perhaps I can express tan(Œ±) and tan(Œ≤) in terms of r and s.Let me denote:[ tan{alpha} = frac{2 cdot frac{r}{s - a}}{1 - left( frac{r}{s - a} right)^2 } = frac{2r(s - a)}{(s - a)^2 - r^2} ]Similarly,[ tan{beta} = frac{2r(s - b)}{(s - b)^2 - r^2} ]And,[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} = frac{r}{s - c} ]So, substituting into the original equation:[ a + b = frac{r}{s - c} left( a cdot frac{2r(s - a)}{(s - a)^2 - r^2} + b cdot frac{2r(s - b)}{(s - b)^2 - r^2} right) ]This seems very complicated, but perhaps I can simplify.Let me write it as:[ a + b = frac{r}{s - c} cdot 2r left( frac{a(s - a)}{(s - a)^2 - r^2} + frac{b(s - b)}{(s - b)^2 - r^2} right) ]Simplify:[ a + b = frac{2r^2}{s - c} left( frac{a(s - a)}{(s - a)^2 - r^2} + frac{b(s - b)}{(s - b)^2 - r^2} right) ]Hmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe I need to find another approach.Wait, going back to the earlier substitution with x and y, perhaps I can consider that if x ‚â† y, then the equation would not hold, implying x = y.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the function f(x, y) = L - R and show that it's zero only when x = y.But this might require calculus, which might be beyond the scope.Wait, another idea: perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the angles are related, so if Œ± ‚â† Œ≤, then Œ≥ would have to adjust accordingly, but perhaps the given equation would not hold unless Œ± = Œ≤.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the given equation is symmetric in a and b, so if a ‚â† b, then the equation would not hold.Wait, actually, the equation is symmetric in a and b, so if a ‚â† b, then perhaps the equation would not hold unless some other condition is met, which might force a = b.Wait, let me think about that. The equation is:[ a + b = tan{frac{gamma}{2}}(a tan{alpha} + b tan{beta}) ]If a ‚â† b, then the right-hand side would have different coefficients for a and b, but the left-hand side is symmetric. So, perhaps the only way the equation holds is if a = b.Wait, but that's not necessarily rigorous. Let me see.Suppose a ‚â† b. Then, the right-hand side is a linear combination of a and b with coefficients involving tan(Œ±) and tan(Œ≤). The left-hand side is a + b. So, for the equation to hold, the coefficients of a and b on both sides must match.So, let me write the equation as:[ a + b = a tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{alpha} + b tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{beta} ]So, grouping terms:[ a(1 - tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{alpha}) + b(1 - tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{beta}) = 0 ]Since a and b are positive, the only way this equation holds is if both coefficients are zero, i.e.,[ 1 - tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{alpha} = 0 ][ 1 - tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{beta} = 0 ]Which implies:[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{alpha} = 1 ][ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{beta} = 1 ]So, from both equations, we have:[ tan{alpha} = tan{beta} ]Which implies Œ± = Œ≤, since angles in a triangle are between 0 and œÄ, and tan is injective in (0, œÄ/2).Therefore, Œ± = Œ≤, which implies a = b, so the triangle is isosceles.Wait, that seems to be the key. Let me write that more clearly.Given the equation:[ a + b = tan{frac{gamma}{2}}(a tan{alpha} + b tan{beta}) ]We can rearrange it as:[ a + b = a tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{alpha} + b tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{beta} ]Which can be rewritten as:[ a(1 - tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{alpha}) + b(1 - tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{beta}) = 0 ]Since a and b are positive lengths, the only way this equation holds is if both coefficients are zero:[ 1 - tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{alpha} = 0 ][ 1 - tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{beta} = 0 ]Thus,[ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{alpha} = 1 ][ tan{frac{gamma}{2}} tan{beta} = 1 ]Therefore,[ tan{alpha} = tan{beta} ]Since Œ± and Œ≤ are angles in a triangle, they are between 0 and œÄ, and tan is injective in (0, œÄ/2). Therefore, Œ± = Œ≤.Hence, the triangle has two equal angles, which implies the sides opposite those angles are equal, i.e., a = b.Therefore, the triangle is isosceles.That seems to be a more straightforward approach. I think this is the correct path."},{"question":"Given that F_1 and F_2 are the left and right foci of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0), and e is the eccentricity of the hyperbola. If there exists a point M on the right branch of the hyperbola such that |MF_2| = |F_1F_2| and e sin angle MF_1F_2 = 1, then the eccentricity e of the hyperbola is equal to:A: frac{5}{4}B: frac{5}{3}C: sqrt{5}D: frac{5}{2}","answer":"Okay, so I have this hyperbola problem here, and I need to find the eccentricity ( e ). Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to do step by step.First, the hyperbola is given by the equation ( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where ( a > 0 ) and ( b > 0 ). The foci of this hyperbola are ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ), which are on the x-axis since it's a horizontal hyperbola. The foci are located at ( (-c, 0) ) and ( (c, 0) ) respectively, where ( c ) is the distance from the center to each focus. I remember that for hyperbolas, ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ), and the eccentricity ( e ) is defined as ( e = frac{c}{a} ).Now, the problem states that there exists a point ( M ) on the right branch of the hyperbola such that ( |MF_2| = |F_1F_2| ) and ( e sin angle MF_1F_2 = 1 ). I need to find the value of ( e ).Let me break this down. First, ( |F_1F_2| ) is the distance between the two foci. Since ( F_1 ) is at ( (-c, 0) ) and ( F_2 ) is at ( (c, 0) ), the distance between them is ( 2c ). So, ( |MF_2| = 2c ).Point ( M ) is on the right branch, so its coordinates are ( (x, y) ) where ( x geq a ). The distance from ( M ) to ( F_2 ) is ( sqrt{(x - c)^2 + y^2} = 2c ). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:( (x - c)^2 + y^2 = (2c)^2 )( (x - c)^2 + y^2 = 4c^2 )Since ( M ) is on the hyperbola, it must satisfy the hyperbola equation:( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 )So, ( y^2 = b^2 left( frac{x^2}{a^2} - 1 right) )I can substitute this into the distance equation:( (x - c)^2 + b^2 left( frac{x^2}{a^2} - 1 right) = 4c^2 )Let me expand ( (x - c)^2 ):( x^2 - 2cx + c^2 + frac{b^2}{a^2}x^2 - b^2 = 4c^2 )Combine like terms:( left(1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}right)x^2 - 2cx + (c^2 - b^2) = 4c^2 )Bring all terms to one side:( left(1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}right)x^2 - 2cx + (c^2 - b^2 - 4c^2) = 0 )Simplify the constants:( left(1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}right)x^2 - 2cx - 3c^2 - b^2 = 0 )Hmm, this is a quadratic in ( x ). Maybe I can solve for ( x ), but before that, let me recall that ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ). So, ( c^2 - b^2 = a^2 ). Let me substitute that:( left(1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}right)x^2 - 2cx - 3c^2 - b^2 = 0 )But ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ), so ( 3c^2 = 3a^2 + 3b^2 ). Therefore:( left(1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}right)x^2 - 2cx - 3a^2 - 3b^2 - b^2 = 0 )Simplify:( left(1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}right)x^2 - 2cx - 3a^2 - 4b^2 = 0 )This seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think about the triangle ( MF_1F_2 ).We know ( |MF_2| = 2c ), and ( |F_1F_2| = 2c ). So, triangle ( MF_1F_2 ) has two sides equal to ( 2c ): ( MF_2 ) and ( F_1F_2 ). Therefore, it's an isosceles triangle with ( F_2 ) as the apex.Wait, but ( M ) is on the hyperbola, so maybe I can use the definition of a hyperbola. The difference of distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to ( 2a ). So, ( |MF_1| - |MF_2| = 2a ).But we know ( |MF_2| = 2c ), so ( |MF_1| = 2a + 2c ).So, in triangle ( MF_1F_2 ), we have sides ( |MF_1| = 2a + 2c ), ( |MF_2| = 2c ), and ( |F_1F_2| = 2c ). So, sides are ( 2a + 2c ), ( 2c ), ( 2c ). Hmm, so it's an isosceles triangle with two sides equal to ( 2c ) and the third side ( 2a + 2c ).Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, ( 2c + 2c > 2a + 2c ) implies ( 2c > 2a ), which is true since ( c > a ) for hyperbolas. Similarly, ( 2c + (2a + 2c) > 2c ) is obviously true, and ( 2c + (2a + 2c) > 2c ) as well.So, triangle inequality holds. Now, let me try to use the Law of Sines or Cosines on this triangle.Given that ( e sin angle MF_1F_2 = 1 ), so ( sin angle MF_1F_2 = frac{1}{e} ).Let me denote ( angle MF_1F_2 ) as ( theta ). So, ( sin theta = frac{1}{e} ).In triangle ( MF_1F_2 ), sides opposite to the angles:- ( |MF_2| = 2c ) opposite angle ( angle F_1 )- ( |F_1F_2| = 2c ) opposite angle ( angle M )- ( |MF_1| = 2a + 2c ) opposite angle ( angle F_2 )Wait, actually, in triangle notation, the angles are opposite the respective sides. So, angle ( theta = angle MF_1F_2 ) is at vertex ( F_1 ), so the side opposite to it is ( |MF_2| = 2c ).So, using the Law of Sines:( frac{|MF_2|}{sin angle F_1} = frac{|MF_1|}{sin angle F_2} = frac{|F_1F_2|}{sin angle M} )But we know ( |MF_2| = 2c ), ( |F_1F_2| = 2c ), ( |MF_1| = 2a + 2c ), and ( sin theta = frac{1}{e} ).So, focusing on angle ( theta = angle MF_1F_2 ), which is at ( F_1 ), and the side opposite to it is ( |MF_2| = 2c ). The Law of Sines gives:( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{2a + 2c}{sin angle F_2} )But I don't know ( angle F_2 ). Maybe I can find another relation.Alternatively, since the triangle is isosceles with two sides equal to ( 2c ), the base angles are equal. So, ( angle F_1 = angle M ). Wait, no, because the two equal sides are ( |MF_2| = 2c ) and ( |F_1F_2| = 2c ), so the angles opposite these sides are equal. Therefore, ( angle F_1 = angle M ).Wait, let me clarify:In triangle ( MF_1F_2 ), sides ( |MF_2| = 2c ) and ( |F_1F_2| = 2c ). Therefore, the angles opposite these sides are equal. So, ( angle F_1 = angle M ).But ( angle F_1 ) is ( theta ), so ( angle M = theta ). Then, the third angle ( angle F_2 ) can be found since the sum of angles in a triangle is ( 180^circ ):( theta + theta + angle F_2 = 180^circ )( 2theta + angle F_2 = 180^circ )( angle F_2 = 180^circ - 2theta )Now, using the Law of Sines:( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{2a + 2c}{sin (180^circ - 2theta)} )But ( sin (180^circ - 2theta) = sin 2theta ), so:( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{2a + 2c}{sin 2theta} )Simplify:( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{2(a + c)}{2 sin theta cos theta} ) (since ( sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta ))So,( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{2(a + c)}{2 sin theta cos theta} )Simplify both sides:Left side: ( frac{2c}{sin theta} )Right side: ( frac{2(a + c)}{2 sin theta cos theta} = frac{(a + c)}{sin theta cos theta} )So,( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{a + c}{sin theta cos theta} )Multiply both sides by ( sin theta ):( 2c = frac{a + c}{cos theta} )So,( 2c cos theta = a + c )Therefore,( cos theta = frac{a + c}{2c} )But we also know that ( sin theta = frac{1}{e} ). Since ( sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1 ), we can write:( left( frac{1}{e} right)^2 + left( frac{a + c}{2c} right)^2 = 1 )Let me write this equation:( frac{1}{e^2} + left( frac{a + c}{2c} right)^2 = 1 )But ( e = frac{c}{a} ), so ( c = a e ). Let me substitute ( c = a e ) into the equation:First, ( frac{1}{e^2} ) remains as is.Second, ( frac{a + c}{2c} = frac{a + a e}{2 a e} = frac{a(1 + e)}{2 a e} = frac{1 + e}{2 e} ). So, squared, it's ( left( frac{1 + e}{2 e} right)^2 ).So, the equation becomes:( frac{1}{e^2} + left( frac{1 + e}{2 e} right)^2 = 1 )Let me compute each term:First term: ( frac{1}{e^2} )Second term: ( frac{(1 + e)^2}{4 e^2} = frac{1 + 2e + e^2}{4 e^2} )So, adding them together:( frac{1}{e^2} + frac{1 + 2e + e^2}{4 e^2} = 1 )Combine the fractions:Multiply numerator and denominator appropriately:( frac{4}{4 e^2} + frac{1 + 2e + e^2}{4 e^2} = 1 )Combine numerators:( frac{4 + 1 + 2e + e^2}{4 e^2} = 1 )Simplify numerator:( 4 + 1 = 5, so 5 + 2e + e^2 )Thus:( frac{e^2 + 2e + 5}{4 e^2} = 1 )Multiply both sides by ( 4 e^2 ):( e^2 + 2e + 5 = 4 e^2 )Bring all terms to one side:( e^2 + 2e + 5 - 4 e^2 = 0 )Simplify:( -3 e^2 + 2e + 5 = 0 )Multiply both sides by -1:( 3 e^2 - 2e - 5 = 0 )Now, solve this quadratic equation for ( e ):( 3 e^2 - 2e - 5 = 0 )Using the quadratic formula:( e = frac{2 pm sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot (-5)}}{2 cdot 3} )Simplify inside the square root:( 4 + 60 = 64 )So,( e = frac{2 pm 8}{6} )This gives two solutions:1. ( e = frac{2 + 8}{6} = frac{10}{6} = frac{5}{3} )2. ( e = frac{2 - 8}{6} = frac{-6}{6} = -1 )Since eccentricity ( e ) is always positive for hyperbolas, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, ( e = frac{5}{3} ).Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the Law of Sines, I had:( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{2(a + c)}{sin 2theta} )Then, using ( sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta ), which is correct.So,( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{2(a + c)}{2 sin theta cos theta} )Simplify:( frac{2c}{sin theta} = frac{a + c}{sin theta cos theta} )Multiply both sides by ( sin theta ):( 2c = frac{a + c}{cos theta} )So,( cos theta = frac{a + c}{2c} )Then, using ( sin theta = frac{1}{e} ), and ( sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1 ), which is correct.Substituting ( c = a e ), which is correct since ( e = c/a ).So, substituting:( frac{1}{e^2} + left( frac{1 + e}{2 e} right)^2 = 1 )Expanding and simplifying led me to the quadratic equation, which gave ( e = 5/3 ). That seems consistent.Let me check if ( e = 5/3 ) makes sense. For a hyperbola, ( e > 1 ), which it does. Also, ( b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = a^2 e^2 - a^2 = a^2 (e^2 - 1) ). So, ( b = a sqrt{e^2 - 1} ). If ( e = 5/3 ), then ( b = a sqrt{(25/9) - 1} = a sqrt{16/9} = (4/3)a ). So, ( b = (4/3)a ), which is positive, as required.Therefore, I think my solution is correct, and the eccentricity ( e ) is ( frac{5}{3} ).**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"The cinema has enough seats for 312_5 people.

So, if I denote the first term as a_1, then the second term a_2 would be a_1 + 2, the third term a_3 would be a_1 + 4, and so on. In general, the nth term a_n can be written as a_1 + 2(n - 1). Now, the problem also mentions that a_3 + 1 is the geometric mean of a_1 + 1 and a_7 + 1. Hmm, geometric mean. I remember that the geometric mean of two numbers x and y is sqrt(xy). So, according to the problem, (a_3 + 1) should be equal to the square root of (a_1 + 1)(a_7 + 1). Let me write that down as an equation:(a_3 + 1)^2 = (a_1 + 1)(a_7 + 1)Since I know the general form of an arithmetic progression, I can express a_3 and a_7 in terms of a_1. a_3 is the third term, so that's a_1 + 2*(3 - 1) = a_1 + 4.Similarly, a_7 is the seventh term, which is a_1 + 2*(7 - 1) = a_1 + 12.So, substituting these into the equation:(a_1 + 4 + 1)^2 = (a_1 + 1)(a_1 + 12 + 1)Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:(a_1 + 5)^2 = (a_1 + 1)(a_1 + 13)Now, let's expand both sides.Left side: (a_1 + 5)^2 = a_1^2 + 10a_1 + 25Right side: (a_1 + 1)(a_1 + 13) = a_1^2 + 14a_1 + 13So, setting them equal:a_1^2 + 10a_1 + 25 = a_1^2 + 14a_1 + 13Hmm, let's subtract a_1^2 from both sides to simplify:10a_1 + 25 = 14a_1 + 13Now, let's bring all terms to one side:10a_1 + 25 - 14a_1 - 13 = 0Combine like terms:-4a_1 + 12 = 0So, -4a_1 = -12Divide both sides by -4:a_1 = 3Alright, so the first term a_1 is 3. Now, since the common difference is 2, the general term a_n is:a_n = a_1 + 2(n - 1) = 3 + 2n - 2 = 2n + 1So, a_n = 2n + 1. That should be the general term formula for the sequence.Moving on to the second part. I need to find the sum T_n of the first n terms of the sequence {1/(a_n * a_{n+1})}.First, let's understand what this sequence looks like. Each term is 1 divided by the product of consecutive terms of the arithmetic progression. So, the first term is 1/(a_1 * a_2), the second term is 1/(a_2 * a_3), and so on.Given that a_n = 2n + 1, let's write out a few terms to see the pattern.a_1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3a_2 = 2*2 + 1 = 5a_3 = 2*3 + 1 = 7a_4 = 2*4 + 1 = 9So, the sequence {1/(a_n * a_{n+1})} would be:1/(3*5), 1/(5*7), 1/(7*9), 1/(9*11), ...I notice that each term is of the form 1/((2n + 1)(2n + 3)). Maybe I can use partial fractions to simplify this expression.Let me try to express 1/((2n + 1)(2n + 3)) as A/(2n + 1) + B/(2n + 3). So, 1/((2n + 1)(2n + 3)) = A/(2n + 1) + B/(2n + 3)Multiplying both sides by (2n + 1)(2n + 3):1 = A(2n + 3) + B(2n + 1)Now, let's solve for A and B. Expanding the right side:1 = (2A + 2B)n + (3A + B)Since this must hold for all n, the coefficients of n and the constant term must be equal on both sides. Coefficient of n: 2A + 2B = 0Constant term: 3A + B = 1So, we have a system of equations:1) 2A + 2B = 02) 3A + B = 1Let me solve equation 1) for A:2A + 2B = 0 => A + B = 0 => A = -BSubstitute A = -B into equation 2):3*(-B) + B = 1 => -3B + B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2Then, A = -B = 1/2So, the partial fractions decomposition is:1/((2n + 1)(2n + 3)) = (1/2)/(2n + 1) - (1/2)/(2n + 3)Therefore, each term 1/(a_n * a_{n+1}) can be written as:(1/2)(1/(2n + 1) - 1/(2n + 3))Now, to find the sum T_n of the first n terms, let's write out the terms:T_n = sum_{k=1}^{n} [ (1/2)(1/(2k + 1) - 1/(2k + 3)) ]Factor out the 1/2:T_n = (1/2) * sum_{k=1}^{n} [1/(2k + 1) - 1/(2k + 3)]Let me write out the terms of the sum to see if there's a telescoping effect.For k = 1: 1/3 - 1/5For k = 2: 1/5 - 1/7For k = 3: 1/7 - 1/9...For k = n: 1/(2n + 1) - 1/(2n + 3)When we add these up, most of the intermediate terms cancel out:(1/3 - 1/5) + (1/5 - 1/7) + (1/7 - 1/9) + ... + (1/(2n + 1) - 1/(2n + 3))All the -1/5, +1/5; -1/7, +1/7; etc., cancel each other. So, we're left with:1/3 - 1/(2n + 3)Therefore, the sum T_n is:T_n = (1/2)(1/3 - 1/(2n + 3)) = (1/2)( (2n + 3 - 3)/(3(2n + 3)) ) = (1/2)( (2n)/(3(2n + 3)) ) = (1/2)(2n)/(3(2n + 3)) = n/(3(2n + 3))Simplify further:n/(6n + 9) = n/(3(2n + 3)) = n/(6n + 9)Alternatively, we can factor out a 3 from the denominator:n/(3(2n + 3)) = (n)/(3(2n + 3))I think that's as simplified as it gets. So, the sum T_n is n divided by (6n + 9), which can also be written as n/(3(2n + 3)).Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I found a_1 correctly by setting up the equation from the geometric mean condition. That seems solid.2. Then, I wrote the general term a_n as 2n + 1, which makes sense given a_1 = 3 and common difference 2.3. For the second part, I expressed 1/(a_n * a_{n+1}) as partial fractions, which is a standard technique for telescoping series. I think that was done correctly.4. Then, I expanded the sum and noticed the telescoping effect, which cancels out all the middle terms, leaving only the first and the last terms. That seems right.5. Finally, I simplified the expression and arrived at T_n = n/(6n + 9). Wait, let me check the partial fractions again. I had:1/((2n + 1)(2n + 3)) = (1/2)/(2n + 1) - (1/2)/(2n + 3)Yes, that's correct because when I plug in n = 1, it gives 1/(3*5) = 1/15, and (1/2)(1/3 - 1/5) = (1/2)(5/15 - 3/15) = (1/2)(2/15) = 1/15. So, that checks out.Then, when I summed up the terms, the telescoping worked as expected, leaving 1/3 - 1/(2n + 3). Multiplying by 1/2 gives (1/2)(1/3 - 1/(2n + 3)).Calculating that:(1/2)(1/3) = 1/6(1/2)(1/(2n + 3)) = 1/(2(2n + 3)) = 1/(4n + 6)So, T_n = 1/6 - 1/(4n + 6)To combine these terms, find a common denominator, which is 12n + 18.1/6 = (2n + 3)/(12n + 18)1/(4n + 6) = 3/(12n + 18)So, T_n = (2n + 3 - 3)/(12n + 18) = 2n/(12n + 18) = n/(6n + 9)Which is the same as before. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, I can factor numerator and denominator:n/(6n + 9) = n/(3(2n + 3)) = (n)/(3(2n + 3))Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first form is simpler.So, I think my final answer for T_n is n/(6n + 9).**Final Answer**1. The general term is boxed{2n + 1}.2. The sum ( T_n ) is boxed{dfrac{n}{6n + 9}}."},{"question":"Determine the value of ( k ) if the lines ( y = 7x + 6 ), ( y = -3x + 9 ), and ( y = 4x + k ) intersect at the same point.","answer":"First, I need to determine the point where the first two lines intersect. I'll set the equations ( y = 7x + 6 ) and ( y = -3x + 9 ) equal to each other to find the x-coordinate of the intersection point.By solving the equation ( 7x + 6 = -3x + 9 ), I can isolate ( x ) and find its value. Once I have the x-coordinate, I'll substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding y-coordinate.After finding the intersection point of the first two lines, I'll use this point to determine the value of ( k ) in the third line's equation ( y = 4x + k ). By plugging in the x and y values from the intersection point into this equation, I can solve for ( k ).This process ensures that all three lines intersect at the same point, allowing me to find the correct value of ( k )."},{"question":"At what value of b do the graphs of y=bx^2+2x+2 and y=-2x-2 intersect at exactly one point?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of ( b ) where the graphs of ( y = bx^2 + 2x + 2 ) and ( y = -2x - 2 ) intersect at exactly one point. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when two graphs intersect, their ( y )-values are equal at that point. So, I can set the two equations equal to each other to find the points of intersection. That means I'll set ( bx^2 + 2x + 2 ) equal to ( -2x - 2 ). Let me write that down:[ bx^2 + 2x + 2 = -2x - 2 ]Now, I need to solve this equation for ( x ). To do that, I should bring all the terms to one side so that I have a quadratic equation. Let me subtract ( -2x - 2 ) from both sides to get everything on the left:[ bx^2 + 2x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 0 ]Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check my subtraction. If I subtract ( -2x - 2 ) from both sides, it's the same as adding ( 2x + 2 ) to both sides. So, adding ( 2x + 2 ) to the left side:[ bx^2 + 2x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 0 ]Now, combine like terms. The ( 2x ) and ( 2x ) terms add up to ( 4x ), and the constants ( 2 ) and ( 2 ) add up to ( 4 ). So, the equation becomes:[ bx^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 ]Alright, so now I have a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ): ( bx^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 ). The problem states that the graphs intersect at exactly one point, which means this quadratic equation should have exactly one solution. I remember that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the discriminant ( D ) determines the number of solutions. The discriminant is given by:[ D = b^2 - 4ac ]If the discriminant is zero, the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution. So, in this case, I need to set the discriminant of ( bx^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 ) equal to zero and solve for ( b ).Let me identify the coefficients in my quadratic equation. Here, ( a = b ), ( b = 4 ), and ( c = 4 ). Plugging these into the discriminant formula:[ D = (4)^2 - 4(b)(4) ]Calculating each part:[ D = 16 - 16b ]Now, set the discriminant equal to zero for exactly one solution:[ 16 - 16b = 0 ]Solving for ( b ):[ 16 = 16b ][ b = frac{16}{16} ][ b = 1 ]So, the value of ( b ) that makes the two graphs intersect at exactly one point is 1. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I set the two equations equal to each other because that's where they intersect.2. I moved all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation.3. I combined like terms correctly to simplify the equation.4. I identified the coefficients correctly for the discriminant.5. I calculated the discriminant and set it to zero for one solution.6. Solved the resulting equation for ( b ) correctly.Everything seems to check out. So, I'm confident that ( b = 1 ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( b ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given the system of equations:p / q = 6 / 7p / r = 8 / 9q / r = x / yFind the value of x and y, and then calculate 2p + q.","answer":"First, I need to find the values of ( x ) and ( y ) from the given ratios. I'll start by expressing ( q ) and ( r ) in terms of ( p ) using the first two equations.From the first equation:[frac{p}{q} = frac{6}{7} implies q = frac{7}{6}p]From the second equation:[frac{p}{r} = frac{8}{9} implies r = frac{9}{8}p]Now, I'll find the ratio ( frac{q}{r} ):[frac{q}{r} = frac{frac{7}{6}p}{frac{9}{8}p} = frac{7}{6} times frac{8}{9} = frac{56}{54} = frac{28}{27}]So, ( x = 28 ) and ( y = 27 ).Next, I'll calculate ( 2p + q ). Using the expression for ( q ) from earlier:[q = frac{7}{6}p]Substitute ( q ) into the expression:[2p + q = 2p + frac{7}{6}p = frac{12}{6}p + frac{7}{6}p = frac{19}{6}p]Since there's no numerical value for ( p ), the final expression for ( 2p + q ) is ( frac{19}{6}p )."},{"question":"The average of marks obtained by 120 boys was 35.

I'll start by defining the variables: let ( P ) represent the number of passed boys and ( F ) represent the number of failed boys.Since the total number of boys is 120, I can write the equation:[P + F = 120]Next, I'll consider the total marks obtained by all the boys. The average marks for all boys is 35, so the total marks can be calculated as:[35 times 120 = 4200]The total marks can also be expressed as the sum of the marks obtained by the passed boys and the failed boys:[39P + 15F = 4200]Now, I'll substitute ( F ) from the first equation into the second equation:[39P + 15(120 - P) = 4200]Expanding and simplifying the equation:[39P + 1800 - 15P = 4200][24P + 1800 = 4200][24P = 2400][P = frac{2400}{24} = 100]Therefore, 100 boys passed the examination."},{"question":"(5 points) Two lines that are perpendicular to the same line must be ()A: ParallelB: IntersectC: SkewD: Any of the above","answer":"First, I need to understand the question: \\"Two lines that are perpendicular to the same line must be ()\\" with options A: Parallel, B: Intersect, C: Skew, D: Any of the above.I recall that in a two-dimensional plane, if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they must be parallel to each other because they never intersect and maintain a constant distance apart.However, in three-dimensional space, the situation is different. Two lines that are both perpendicular to the same line can either be parallel, intersect at a point, or be skew lines. Skew lines are lines that do not intersect and are not parallel, but they exist in different planes.Therefore, depending on whether we are considering lines in a plane or in space, the relationship between two lines perpendicular to the same line can vary. This means that the correct answer must account for all possible scenarios.Considering the options provided, option D: \\"Any of the above\\" is the most comprehensive and accurate because it acknowledges that the lines could be parallel, intersecting, or skew, depending on the context.Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is D: Any of the above."},{"question":"(cos^{2}left(x+40^{circ}right) + cos^{2}left(x-40^{circ}right) - sin 10^{circ} cos 2x = sin 2x)","answer":"Okay, so I've got this trigonometric equation to solve: [cos^{2}left(x+40^{circ}right) + cos^{2}left(x-40^{circ}right) - sin 10^{circ} cos 2x = sin 2x]Hmm, trigonometric equations can be tricky, but let's take it step by step. First, I remember that there are some identities that can help simplify expressions involving squares of cosines. Maybe I can use the power-reduction formula here. The power-reduction formula for cosine squared is:[cos^{2} A = frac{1 + cos 2A}{2}]So, if I apply this to both (cos^{2}(x + 40^{circ})) and (cos^{2}(x - 40^{circ})), I can rewrite those terms. Let's do that:[cos^{2}(x + 40^{circ}) = frac{1 + cos(2x + 80^{circ})}{2}][cos^{2}(x - 40^{circ}) = frac{1 + cos(2x - 80^{circ})}{2}]Now, substitute these back into the original equation:[frac{1 + cos(2x + 80^{circ})}{2} + frac{1 + cos(2x - 80^{circ})}{2} - sin 10^{circ} cos 2x = sin 2x]Let me simplify this. Combine the fractions:[frac{1}{2} + frac{cos(2x + 80^{circ})}{2} + frac{1}{2} + frac{cos(2x - 80^{circ})}{2} - sin 10^{circ} cos 2x = sin 2x]Combine the constants:[1 + frac{1}{2}(cos(2x + 80^{circ}) + cos(2x - 80^{circ})) - sin 10^{circ} cos 2x = sin 2x]Now, I remember another identity: the sum of cosines. The identity is:[cos A + cos B = 2 cosleft(frac{A + B}{2}right) cosleft(frac{A - B}{2}right)]Let me apply this to (cos(2x + 80^{circ}) + cos(2x - 80^{circ})). Here, (A = 2x + 80^{circ}) and (B = 2x - 80^{circ}). So,[cos(2x + 80^{circ}) + cos(2x - 80^{circ}) = 2 cosleft(frac{(2x + 80^{circ}) + (2x - 80^{circ})}{2}right) cosleft(frac{(2x + 80^{circ}) - (2x - 80^{circ})}{2}right)]Simplify the arguments:[= 2 cosleft(frac{4x}{2}right) cosleft(frac{160^{circ}}{2}right)][= 2 cos(2x) cos(80^{circ})]So, substituting back into the equation:[1 + frac{1}{2}(2 cos(2x) cos(80^{circ})) - sin 10^{circ} cos 2x = sin 2x]Simplify the terms:[1 + cos(2x) cos(80^{circ}) - sin 10^{circ} cos 2x = sin 2x]Wait a second, I notice that (cos(80^{circ})) is equal to (sin(10^{circ})) because (cos(90^{circ} - theta) = sin theta). So, (cos(80^{circ}) = sin(10^{circ})). That means:[1 + cos(2x) sin(10^{circ}) - sin(10^{circ}) cos(2x) = sin 2x]But look at that! The terms (cos(2x) sin(10^{circ})) and (-sin(10^{circ}) cos(2x)) cancel each other out. So, we're left with:[1 = sin 2x]Okay, so (sin 2x = 1). When does sine equal 1? Well, sine of 90 degrees is 1, and it repeats every 360 degrees. So, the general solution for (2x) is:[2x = 90^{circ} + 360^{circ}k quad text{where } k text{ is an integer}]Therefore, solving for (x):[x = 45^{circ} + 180^{circ}k]But since we're dealing with degrees, and trigonometric functions are periodic, we can express this in radians if needed. But the problem didn't specify, so degrees should be fine. However, sometimes solutions are preferred in radians. Let me convert 45 degrees to radians:[45^{circ} = frac{pi}{4} text{ radians}][180^{circ} = pi text{ radians}]So, in radians:[x = frac{pi}{4} + pi k quad text{where } k text{ is an integer}]Alternatively, factoring out (frac{pi}{4}):[x = frac{pi}{4}(1 + 4k) quad text{where } k text{ is an integer}]But both forms are correct. The key is that the solution repeats every (pi) radians or 180 degrees.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation, I used the power-reduction formula correctly. Then, I applied the sum-to-product identity accurately, which simplified the equation nicely. Recognizing that (cos(80^{circ}) = sin(10^{circ})) was crucial because it led to the cancellation of terms, leaving me with a simple equation to solve. The final step of solving (sin 2x = 1) is straightforward, giving the solution (x = 45^{circ} + 180^{circ}k). I think everything checks out. The key was to simplify the equation using appropriate trigonometric identities and then solve the resulting simpler equation. It's important to remember these identities because they can turn complicated expressions into manageable ones.**Final Answer**The solutions are given by (x = frac{pi}{4} + pi k) for any integer (k), which can be written as (boxed{x = frac{pi}{4} + pi k}) where (k in mathbb{Z})."},{"question":"Suppose g(x) is a rational function such that 4gleft(dfrac{1}{x}right)+dfrac{3g(x)}{x}=2x^3 for xneq 0. Find g(-1).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find ( g(-1) ) given that ( g(x) ) is a rational function satisfying the equation:[ 4gleft(dfrac{1}{x}right) + dfrac{3g(x)}{x} = 2x^3 quad text{for} quad x neq 0. ]Hmm, let me try to understand what this means. A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials, so ( g(x) ) can be written as ( dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)} ) where ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) are polynomials. But maybe I don't need to find the entire function ( g(x) ); perhaps I can find ( g(-1) ) directly by plugging in specific values of ( x ).The equation involves ( gleft(dfrac{1}{x}right) ) and ( g(x) ). That suggests that if I plug in ( x ) and then plug in ( dfrac{1}{x} ), I might get another equation that I can solve together with the first one. Let me try that.First, let me set ( x = -1 ). Then, the equation becomes:[ 4gleft(dfrac{1}{-1}right) + dfrac{3g(-1)}{-1} = 2(-1)^3. ]Simplifying each term:- ( dfrac{1}{-1} = -1 ), so ( gleft(dfrac{1}{-1}right) = g(-1) ).- ( dfrac{3g(-1)}{-1} = -3g(-1) ).- ( 2(-1)^3 = 2(-1) = -2 ).So substituting back into the equation:[ 4g(-1) - 3g(-1) = -2. ]Combine like terms:[ (4 - 3)g(-1) = -2 ][ 1 cdot g(-1) = -2 ][ g(-1) = -2. ]Wait, so does that mean I'm done? It seems too straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense.If I plug ( x = -1 ) into the original equation, I get an equation involving ( g(-1) ) and ( g(-1) ) again, which allows me to solve directly for ( g(-1) ). That seems correct.But just to be thorough, maybe I should test another value of ( x ) to see if the result is consistent. Let's try ( x = 1 ). Plugging ( x = 1 ) into the original equation:[ 4gleft(dfrac{1}{1}right) + dfrac{3g(1)}{1} = 2(1)^3 ][ 4g(1) + 3g(1) = 2 ][ 7g(1) = 2 ][ g(1) = dfrac{2}{7}. ]Okay, so ( g(1) ) is ( dfrac{2}{7} ). Let me see if I can find another equation involving ( g(-1) ) and ( g(1) ) to verify consistency.Wait, if I plug ( x = -1 ) into the original equation, I get an equation involving ( g(-1) ) as we saw. But if I plug ( x = -1 ) again, I don't get a new equation. Maybe I need to plug in ( x = -2 ) or some other value.Let me try ( x = -2 ). Plugging ( x = -2 ) into the original equation:[ 4gleft(dfrac{1}{-2}right) + dfrac{3g(-2)}{-2} = 2(-2)^3 ][ 4gleft(-dfrac{1}{2}right) - dfrac{3}{2}g(-2) = 2(-8) ][ 4gleft(-dfrac{1}{2}right) - dfrac{3}{2}g(-2) = -16. ]Hmm, now I have an equation involving ( gleft(-dfrac{1}{2}right) ) and ( g(-2) ). Maybe if I plug in ( x = -dfrac{1}{2} ), I can get another equation.Let me try ( x = -dfrac{1}{2} ):[ 4gleft(dfrac{1}{-1/2}right) + dfrac{3g(-1/2)}{-1/2} = 2left(-dfrac{1}{2}right)^3 ][ 4g(-2) + dfrac{3g(-1/2)}{-1/2} = 2left(-dfrac{1}{8}right) ][ 4g(-2) - 6g(-1/2) = -dfrac{1}{4}. ]So now I have two equations:1. ( 4gleft(-dfrac{1}{2}right) - dfrac{3}{2}g(-2) = -16 )2. ( 4g(-2) - 6g(-1/2) = -dfrac{1}{4} )Let me write these equations more clearly:Equation (1): ( 4g(-1/2) - (3/2)g(-2) = -16 )Equation (2): ( 4g(-2) - 6g(-1/2) = -1/4 )Hmm, so I have two equations with two variables: ( g(-1/2) ) and ( g(-2) ). Maybe I can solve this system.Let me denote ( a = g(-1/2) ) and ( b = g(-2) ). Then the equations become:1. ( 4a - (3/2)b = -16 )2. ( 4b - 6a = -1/4 )Let me rewrite the first equation to eliminate fractions. Multiply both sides by 2:1. ( 8a - 3b = -32 )2. ( -6a + 4b = -1/4 )Now, I can use the method of elimination. Let me multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of ( b ) opposites:1. ( 32a - 12b = -128 )2. ( -18a + 12b = -3/4 )Now, add the two equations:( (32a - 18a) + (-12b + 12b) = -128 - 3/4 )( 14a + 0 = -128.75 )( 14a = -128.75 )( a = -128.75 / 14 )Let me compute this:First, 128.75 divided by 14. 14*9 = 126, so 128.75 - 126 = 2.75So, 128.75 / 14 = 9 + 2.75/142.75 / 14 = 0.19642857...So, approximately, a = -9.19642857...But let me compute it exactly:128.75 is equal to 515/4.So, 515/4 divided by 14 is 515/(4*14) = 515/56.Simplify 515/56: 56*9 = 504, so 515 - 504 = 11. So, 515/56 = 9 + 11/56.Thus, a = -515/56.So, ( a = -515/56 ).Now, let's substitute back into one of the equations to find ( b ). Let's use equation (2):( 4b - 6a = -1/4 )Substitute ( a = -515/56 ):( 4b - 6*(-515/56) = -1/4 )( 4b + (3090/56) = -1/4 )Simplify 3090/56: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 1545/28.So, ( 4b + 1545/28 = -1/4 )Subtract 1545/28 from both sides:( 4b = -1/4 - 1545/28 )Convert -1/4 to 28 denominator: -7/28So, ( 4b = -7/28 - 1545/28 = (-7 - 1545)/28 = -1552/28 )Simplify -1552/28: divide numerator and denominator by 4: -388/7.Thus, ( 4b = -388/7 )( b = (-388/7) / 4 = -388/(7*4) = -97/7 )So, ( b = -97/7 ).Therefore, ( g(-1/2) = a = -515/56 ) and ( g(-2) = b = -97/7 ).Wait, but I was supposed to find ( g(-1) ). Earlier, I found ( g(-1) = -2 ). Let me check if this is consistent with the other equations.Wait, when I plugged in ( x = -1 ), I got ( g(-1) = -2 ). Then, when I plugged in ( x = -2 ) and ( x = -1/2 ), I found ( g(-2) = -97/7 ) and ( g(-1/2) = -515/56 ). Let me see if these satisfy the original equation.Let me verify equation (1):( 4g(-1/2) - (3/2)g(-2) = -16 )Substitute ( g(-1/2) = -515/56 ) and ( g(-2) = -97/7 ):Left side: 4*(-515/56) - (3/2)*(-97/7)Compute each term:4*(-515/56) = (-2060)/56 = (-515)/14 ‚âà -36.7857(3/2)*(-97/7) = (-291)/14 ‚âà -20.7857But since it's subtracting this term, it becomes:-515/14 - (-291/14) = (-515 + 291)/14 = (-224)/14 = -16Which matches the right side. So, equation (1) is satisfied.Similarly, equation (2):( 4g(-2) - 6g(-1/2) = -1/4 )Substitute ( g(-2) = -97/7 ) and ( g(-1/2) = -515/56 ):Left side: 4*(-97/7) - 6*(-515/56)Compute each term:4*(-97/7) = (-388)/7 ‚âà -55.42866*(-515/56) = (-3090)/56 = (-1545)/28 ‚âà -55.1786But since it's subtracting this term, it becomes:-388/7 - (-1545/28) = (-388/7) + (1545/28)Convert to common denominator 28:-388/7 = -1552/28So, (-1552/28) + (1545/28) = (-7)/28 = -1/4Which matches the right side. So, equation (2) is also satisfied.Therefore, my calculations seem consistent. So, ( g(-1) = -2 ) is correct.But just to be extra sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe I can express ( g(x) ) in terms of ( g(1/x) ) and then substitute ( x ) with ( 1/x ) to get another equation, and then solve for ( g(x) ).Let me try that.Given:[ 4gleft(dfrac{1}{x}right) + dfrac{3g(x)}{x} = 2x^3 quad text{(1)} ]Let me replace ( x ) with ( 1/x ) in equation (1):[ 4gleft(dfrac{1}{1/x}right) + dfrac{3g(1/x)}{1/x} = 2left(dfrac{1}{x}right)^3 ][ 4g(x) + 3x gleft(dfrac{1}{x}right) = dfrac{2}{x^3} quad text{(2)} ]Now, I have two equations:Equation (1): ( 4g(1/x) + (3/x)g(x) = 2x^3 )Equation (2): ( 4g(x) + 3x g(1/x) = 2/x^3 )Now, I can treat these as a system of equations in variables ( g(x) ) and ( g(1/x) ). Let me denote ( A = g(x) ) and ( B = g(1/x) ). Then, the equations become:1. ( 4B + (3/x)A = 2x^3 )2. ( 4A + 3x B = 2/x^3 )Now, I can solve this system for ( A ) and ( B ).Let me write the equations:Equation (1): ( 4B + (3/x)A = 2x^3 )Equation (2): ( 4A + 3x B = 2/x^3 )Let me solve for ( A ) and ( B ). Let's use the method of elimination.First, let me multiply equation (1) by 3x to eliminate ( B ):Multiply equation (1) by 3x:( 12x B + 9A = 6x^4 quad text{(3)} )Multiply equation (2) by 4:( 16A + 12x B = 8/x^3 quad text{(4)} )Now, subtract equation (3) from equation (4):( (16A + 12x B) - (12x B + 9A) = 8/x^3 - 6x^4 )( 16A - 9A + 12x B - 12x B = 8/x^3 - 6x^4 )( 7A = 8/x^3 - 6x^4 )( A = dfrac{8}{7x^3} - dfrac{6x^4}{7} )So, ( g(x) = A = dfrac{8}{7x^3} - dfrac{6x^4}{7} )Wait, let me check that again.Wait, when I subtract equation (3) from equation (4):Equation (4): 16A + 12xB = 8/x¬≥Equation (3): 12xB + 9A = 6x‚Å¥Subtract (3) from (4):(16A - 9A) + (12xB - 12xB) = 8/x¬≥ - 6x‚Å¥So, 7A = 8/x¬≥ - 6x‚Å¥Thus, A = (8/x¬≥ - 6x‚Å¥)/7So, ( g(x) = dfrac{8}{7x^3} - dfrac{6x^4}{7} )Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify it.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me double-check.Equation (1): 4B + (3/x)A = 2x¬≥Equation (2): 4A + 3x B = 2/x¬≥Let me solve equation (1) for B:4B = 2x¬≥ - (3/x)AB = (2x¬≥ - (3/x)A)/4Now, substitute this into equation (2):4A + 3x * [(2x¬≥ - (3/x)A)/4] = 2/x¬≥Simplify:4A + (3x/4)(2x¬≥ - (3/x)A) = 2/x¬≥Multiply through:4A + (3x/4)(2x¬≥) - (3x/4)(3/x)A = 2/x¬≥Simplify each term:(3x/4)(2x¬≥) = (6x‚Å¥)/4 = (3x‚Å¥)/2(3x/4)(3/x)A = (9/4)ASo, the equation becomes:4A + (3x‚Å¥)/2 - (9/4)A = 2/x¬≥Combine like terms:(4A - (9/4)A) + (3x‚Å¥)/2 = 2/x¬≥Convert 4A to 16/4 A:(16/4 A - 9/4 A) = (7/4)ASo, (7/4)A + (3x‚Å¥)/2 = 2/x¬≥Now, solve for A:(7/4)A = 2/x¬≥ - (3x‚Å¥)/2Multiply both sides by 4/7:A = (4/7)(2/x¬≥ - (3x‚Å¥)/2)Simplify:A = (8)/(7x¬≥) - (12x‚Å¥)/14Simplify further:A = (8)/(7x¬≥) - (6x‚Å¥)/7So, ( g(x) = dfrac{8}{7x^3} - dfrac{6x^4}{7} )Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check if this function satisfies the original equation.Let me compute ( 4g(1/x) + (3/x)g(x) ) and see if it equals ( 2x^3 ).First, compute ( g(1/x) ):( g(1/x) = dfrac{8}{7(1/x)^3} - dfrac{6(1/x)^4}{7} = dfrac{8x^3}{7} - dfrac{6}{7x^4} )Now, compute ( 4g(1/x) ):( 4g(1/x) = 4*(8x¬≥/7 - 6/(7x‚Å¥)) = 32x¬≥/7 - 24/(7x‚Å¥) )Next, compute ( (3/x)g(x) ):( (3/x)g(x) = (3/x)*(8/(7x¬≥) - 6x‚Å¥/7) = (24)/(7x‚Å¥) - (18x¬≥)/7 )Now, add ( 4g(1/x) + (3/x)g(x) ):( (32x¬≥/7 - 24/(7x‚Å¥)) + (24/(7x‚Å¥) - 18x¬≥/7) )Combine like terms:32x¬≥/7 - 18x¬≥/7 = (14x¬≥)/7 = 2x¬≥-24/(7x‚Å¥) + 24/(7x‚Å¥) = 0So, total is 2x¬≥, which matches the original equation. Great, so this function satisfies the equation.Therefore, ( g(x) = dfrac{8}{7x^3} - dfrac{6x^4}{7} )Now, to find ( g(-1) ):( g(-1) = dfrac{8}{7(-1)^3} - dfrac{6(-1)^4}{7} )Compute each term:( (-1)^3 = -1 ), so ( 8/(7*(-1)) = -8/7 )( (-1)^4 = 1 ), so ( 6*1/7 = 6/7 )Thus,( g(-1) = -8/7 - 6/7 = (-8 - 6)/7 = -14/7 = -2 )So, ( g(-1) = -2 ), which matches what I found earlier.Therefore, the answer is ( boxed{-2} )."},{"question":"Given that line l passes through point (-1,2) and is perpendicular to line 2x-3y=0, find the equation of line l.","answer":"First, I need to determine the slope of the given line (2x - 3y = 0). To do this, I'll rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b).Starting with (2x - 3y = 0), I'll subtract (2x) from both sides to get (-3y = -2x). Then, I'll divide both sides by (-3) to find (y = frac{2}{3}x). This shows that the slope (m) of the given line is (frac{2}{3}).Since line (l) is perpendicular to this line, its slope will be the negative reciprocal of (frac{2}{3}), which is (-frac{3}{2}).Now that I have the slope of line (l), I can use the point-slope form of a line equation to find the specific equation. The point-slope form is (y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)), where ((x_1, y_1)) is a point the line passes through.Substituting the slope (-frac{3}{2}) and the point ((-1, 2)) into the formula, I get:[y - 2 = -frac{3}{2}(x - (-1)) y - 2 = -frac{3}{2}(x + 1)]To simplify this, I'll distribute the (-frac{3}{2}) on the right side:[y - 2 = -frac{3}{2}x - frac{3}{2}]Next, I'll add 2 to both sides to solve for (y):[y = -frac{3}{2}x - frac{3}{2} + 2 y = -frac{3}{2}x + frac{1}{2}]Finally, to write the equation in standard form (Ax + By = C), I'll multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fractions:[2y = -3x + 1 3x + 2y = 1]So, the equation of line (l) is (3x + 2y = 1)."},{"question":"Given that the lines y=(a-a^{2})x-2 and y=(3a+1)x+1 are parallel, find the value of a (  ).A: 2B: 1C: 0D: -1","answer":"First, I recognize that for two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal.The given lines are:1. ( y = (a - a^2)x - 2 )2. ( y = (3a + 1)x + 1 )To find the value of ( a ), I set the slopes equal to each other:[a - a^2 = 3a + 1]Next, I rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:[a^2 + 2a + 1 = 0]This quadratic equation can be factored as:[(a + 1)^2 = 0]Solving for ( a ), I find:[a = -1]Therefore, the value of ( a ) is (-1)."},{"question":"Find the number of solutions to the equation[tan (3 pi cos theta) = cot (3 pi sin theta)]where theta in (0, 3pi).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: (tan (3 pi cos theta) = cot (3 pi sin theta)), and I need to find the number of solutions where (theta) is between 0 and (3pi). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that (cot x) is the reciprocal of (tan x), so (cot x = frac{1}{tan x}). That means I can rewrite the equation as:[tan (3 pi cos theta) = frac{1}{tan (3 pi sin theta)}]Which implies:[tan (3 pi cos theta) cdot tan (3 pi sin theta) = 1]Okay, so the product of these two tangent functions equals 1. I wonder if there's a trigonometric identity that relates the product of tangents to something else. Let me think... Oh, wait! There's an identity for the tangent of a sum:[tan(A + B) = frac{tan A + tan B}{1 - tan A tan B}]If I rearrange this, I can express the product (tan A tan B) in terms of (tan(A + B)). Let me try that. If I let (A = 3pi cos theta) and (B = 3pi sin theta), then:[tan(A + B) = frac{tan A + tan B}{1 - tan A tan B}]But since (tan A tan B = 1) from the equation, substituting that in:[tan(A + B) = frac{tan A + tan B}{1 - 1} = frac{tan A + tan B}{0}]Uh-oh, division by zero. That means (tan(A + B)) is undefined, which happens when the argument is an odd multiple of (frac{pi}{2}). So,[A + B = frac{pi}{2} + kpi quad text{for some integer } k]Substituting back (A) and (B):[3pi cos theta + 3pi sin theta = frac{pi}{2} + kpi]Let me factor out the (3pi):[3pi (cos theta + sin theta) = frac{pi}{2} + kpi]Divide both sides by (pi):[3 (cos theta + sin theta) = frac{1}{2} + k]So,[cos theta + sin theta = frac{1}{6} + frac{k}{3}]Hmm, okay. Now, I know that (cos theta + sin theta) can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Specifically, it can be expressed as (sqrt{2} sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right)). Let me verify that:[sqrt{2} sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) = sqrt{2} left( sin theta cos frac{pi}{4} + cos theta sin frac{pi}{4} right) = sqrt{2} left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin theta + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos theta right) = sin theta + cos theta]Yes, that works. So, substituting back into the equation:[sqrt{2} sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{1}{6} + frac{k}{3}]Let me simplify the right-hand side:[frac{1}{6} + frac{k}{3} = frac{1 + 2k}{6}]So,[sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{1 + 2k}{6sqrt{2}}]Now, since the sine function has a range of ([-1, 1]), the right-hand side must also lie within this interval. Therefore,[left| frac{1 + 2k}{6sqrt{2}} right| leq 1]Let me solve this inequality for (k):[left| 1 + 2k right| leq 6sqrt{2}]Calculating (6sqrt{2}):[6 times 1.4142 approx 8.485]So,[-8.485 leq 1 + 2k leq 8.485]Subtracting 1 from all parts:[-9.485 leq 2k leq 7.485]Dividing by 2:[-4.7425 leq k leq 3.7425]Since (k) is an integer, the possible values of (k) are (-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3). That's 8 values in total.For each value of (k), the equation:[sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{1 + 2k}{6sqrt{2}}]will have solutions for (theta). The number of solutions depends on the value of the right-hand side. Since (theta) is in ((0, 3pi)), the argument (theta + frac{pi}{4}) will range from (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is a span of (3pi).In general, the equation (sin x = c) has two solutions in each (2pi) interval if (|c| < 1). Since our interval is (3pi), which is one and a half times (2pi), we can expect up to three solutions for each (k), but actually, depending on the value of (c), it might have two solutions.Wait, let me think again. The interval from (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}) is (3pi), which is (3pi) long. The sine function has a period of (2pi), so in (3pi), there are one and a half periods. In each period, (sin x = c) has two solutions, so in one and a half periods, it might have three solutions if the value of (c) is such that it crosses the sine curve three times.But wait, actually, no. Because the interval is from (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is more than (2pi) but less than (4pi). Hmm, actually, it's (3pi), which is (1.5 times 2pi). So, in each full period, there are two solutions, so in one and a half periods, there would be three solutions if the value of (c) is such that it's within the range of sine.But actually, let me recall that in an interval of length (2pi), (sin x = c) has two solutions if (|c| < 1). In an interval longer than (2pi), say (2pi + alpha), it can have two or three solutions depending on (alpha) and the value of (c). But in our case, the interval is (3pi), which is (2pi + pi). So, potentially, it can have three solutions if the value of (c) is such that the sine curve crosses the line (y = c) three times in that interval.However, I think in our case, since the interval is (3pi), which is more than (2pi), but the exact number of solutions depends on the specific value of (c). But since we're dealing with multiple values of (k), each giving a different (c), we need to check for each (k) how many solutions exist.But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For each (k), the equation (sin x = c) will have two solutions in each (2pi) interval. Since our interval is (3pi), which is (1.5 times 2pi), we can expect either two or three solutions depending on where the interval starts and ends relative to the sine wave.But actually, since the interval is from (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is a span of (3pi), it's equivalent to shifting the standard interval by (frac{pi}{4}). So, in this shifted interval, the number of solutions would still be two per (2pi), but since we have an extra (pi), it might add an extra solution if the sine curve crosses (c) within that extra (pi).But perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each (k), the equation (sin x = c) will have two solutions in the interval ((frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4})) if (c) is within ((-1, 1)). But actually, since the interval is longer than (2pi), it's possible to have three solutions for some (c).Wait, maybe I should consider the general solution for (sin x = c). The solutions are:[x = arcsin c + 2pi n quad text{and} quad x = pi - arcsin c + 2pi n quad text{for integer } n]So, for each (k), we can find all (x) in the interval (left(frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4}right)) that satisfy the equation. Then, the number of solutions (theta) would correspond to the number of such (x) values.But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to note that in the interval ((0, 3pi)), the function (sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right)) will complete one and a half periods. So, for each (k), if the value (frac{1 + 2k}{6sqrt{2}}) is within ([-1, 1]), the equation will have two solutions in each period, so in one and a half periods, potentially three solutions.But wait, actually, in one full period, there are two solutions, so in one and a half periods, it's possible to have three solutions if the value of (c) is such that it's crossed three times. But I think in reality, for each (k), the equation will have two solutions in the interval ((0, 3pi)). Let me check with an example.Suppose (k = 0), then:[sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{1}{6sqrt{2}} approx 0.117]So, in the interval (theta + frac{pi}{4} in left(frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4}right)), which is (3pi) long, how many solutions are there? The sine function will cross (0.117) twice in each (2pi) interval, so in (3pi), it's one and a half periods, so potentially three solutions? Wait, but actually, no. Because the interval is (3pi), which is (1.5 times 2pi), so it's possible to have three solutions if the value is within the range.But actually, let me think about the graph. The sine function starts at (frac{pi}{4}), which is about 0.785, goes up to 1 at (frac{pi}{2}), then back down to 0 at (pi), down to -1 at (frac{3pi}{2}), back to 0 at (2pi), up to 1 at (frac{5pi}{2}), and back down to 0 at (3pi).So, in the interval from (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is (3pi), the sine function will cross the value (0.117) twice in the first (2pi) and once in the remaining (pi). So, total three solutions.Wait, but actually, no. Because in the first (2pi), it crosses twice, and in the next (pi), it might cross once or not, depending on the value. For (c = 0.117), which is positive, in the interval from (2pi) to (3pi), the sine function goes from 0 down to -1 and back to 0. So, it doesn't cross (0.117) again in that interval. Therefore, in the interval (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is (3pi), the sine function will cross (0.117) twice: once on the rising part and once on the falling part in the first (2pi), and then in the next (pi), it doesn't cross again because it's going negative. So, actually, only two solutions.Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me visualize it.From (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is (3pi), the sine function starts at (sin(frac{pi}{4}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} approx 0.707), goes up to 1 at (frac{pi}{2}), comes back down to 0 at (pi), goes down to -1 at (frac{3pi}{2}), comes back to 0 at (2pi), goes up to 1 at (frac{5pi}{2}), and comes back down to 0 at (3pi).So, for (c = 0.117), which is less than (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), the sine function will cross (c) once on the way up from (frac{pi}{4}) to (frac{pi}{2}), once on the way down from (frac{pi}{2}) to (pi), and then again on the way up from (2pi) to (frac{5pi}{2}). Wait, but in the interval from (2pi) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), the sine function goes from 0 up to 1 at (frac{5pi}{2}) and back down to 0 at (3pi). So, it will cross (c = 0.117) once on the way up and once on the way down in the first (2pi), and then once more on the way up in the next (pi). So, actually, three solutions.Wait, but that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The interval is from (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is (3pi) long. The sine function completes one and a half periods in this interval.In the first period ((frac{pi}{4}) to (2pi + frac{pi}{4})), it crosses (c) twice. In the next half period ((2pi + frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4})), it goes from 0 up to 1 and back down to 0. So, it crosses (c) once on the way up and once on the way down? Wait, no, because it's only a half period. From (2pi + frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), the sine function goes from 0 up to 1 at (frac{5pi}{2}) and back down to 0 at (3pi + frac{pi}{4}). So, it crosses (c) once on the way up and once on the way down, but wait, that's two crossings in a half period? That can't be right because a half period is (pi), and the sine function is symmetric.Wait, no. In a half period, the sine function goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0. So, it crosses each positive value (c) once on the way up and once on the way down. But in a half period, it's only going up and then down, so it crosses (c) twice: once on the way up and once on the way down. But wait, that would mean in the half period, it crosses twice, but that's not possible because the half period is only (pi), and the sine function is symmetric. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something.Wait, actually, in a full period, the sine function crosses each horizontal line (c) (where (|c| < 1)) twice: once on the rising part and once on the falling part. In a half period, it only crosses once if the half period is from peak to trough or trough to peak. But in our case, the half period is from 0 to (pi), which is the rising part from 0 to 1 and then the falling part back to 0. So, in this half period, it crosses each (c) twice: once on the way up and once on the way down. So, in the interval from (2pi + frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is a half period, the sine function crosses (c) twice. Therefore, in the entire interval of (3pi), it crosses (c) twice in the first (2pi) and twice in the next (pi), totaling four solutions? That can't be right because the interval is (3pi), which is one and a half periods, and in each full period, it's two solutions, so one and a half periods would be three solutions.Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use a different approach. Let's consider the general solution for (sin x = c):[x = arcsin c + 2pi n quad text{and} quad x = pi - arcsin c + 2pi n quad text{for integer } n]So, for each (k), we can find all (x) in the interval (left(frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4}right)) that satisfy the equation. Let's denote (c = frac{1 + 2k}{6sqrt{2}}).We need to find all integers (n) such that:1. (x = arcsin c + 2pi n) is in (left(frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4}right))2. (x = pi - arcsin c + 2pi n) is in (left(frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4}right))For each (k), we can find the number of such (n) that satisfy these conditions.Let's take (k = 0) as an example:(c = frac{1}{6sqrt{2}} approx 0.117)So, (arcsin c approx 0.117) radians.Now, let's find (n) such that:1. (0.117 + 2pi n) is in (left(frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4}right))2. (pi - 0.117 + 2pi n) is in (left(frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4}right))Let's solve for (n) in the first case:[frac{pi}{4} < 0.117 + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Subtract 0.117:[frac{pi}{4} - 0.117 < 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4} - 0.117]Divide by (2pi):[frac{1}{8} - frac{0.117}{2pi} < n < frac{3}{2} + frac{1}{8} - frac{0.117}{2pi}]Calculating the numerical values:[0.125 - 0.0186 approx 0.1064 < n < 1.5 + 0.125 - 0.0186 approx 1.6064]So, (n) can be 1.Similarly, for the second case:[frac{pi}{4} < pi - 0.117 + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Subtract (pi - 0.117):[frac{pi}{4} - (pi - 0.117) < 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4} - (pi - 0.117)]Simplify:[-frac{3pi}{4} + 0.117 < 2pi n < 2pi + frac{pi}{4} + 0.117]Divide by (2pi):[-frac{3}{8} + frac{0.117}{2pi} < n < 1 + frac{1}{8} + frac{0.117}{2pi}]Numerically:[-0.375 + 0.0186 approx -0.3564 < n < 1.125 + 0.0186 approx 1.1436]So, (n) can be 0 or 1.Therefore, for (k = 0), we have solutions at (n = 1) for the first case and (n = 0, 1) for the second case. But wait, we need to check if these actually fall within the interval.For (n = 1) in the first case:(x = 0.117 + 2pi(1) approx 0.117 + 6.283 approx 6.400), which is less than (3pi + frac{pi}{4} approx 10.21), so it's valid.For (n = 0) in the second case:(x = pi - 0.117 + 2pi(0) approx 3.0 - 0.117 approx 2.883), which is greater than (frac{pi}{4} approx 0.785), so valid.For (n = 1) in the second case:(x = pi - 0.117 + 2pi(1) approx 3.0 - 0.117 + 6.283 approx 9.166), which is less than (10.21), so valid.Therefore, for (k = 0), we have three solutions: one from the first case ((n = 1)) and two from the second case ((n = 0, 1)). Wait, but that's three solutions. But earlier, I thought it might be two or three. So, in this case, it's three solutions.But wait, let me check if (x = 2.883) is within (frac{pi}{4} approx 0.785) and (3pi + frac{pi}{4} approx 10.21). Yes, it is. Similarly, (x = 9.166) is also within the interval.So, for (k = 0), we have three solutions.Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that it might be two solutions. So, perhaps for some (k), there are three solutions, and for others, two.But let's check another (k). Let's take (k = 1):(c = frac{1 + 2(1)}{6sqrt{2}} = frac{3}{6sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} approx 0.3535)So, (arcsin c approx 0.3614) radians.Now, let's find (n) for the first case:[frac{pi}{4} < 0.3614 + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Subtract 0.3614:[frac{pi}{4} - 0.3614 < 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4} - 0.3614]Divide by (2pi):[frac{1}{8} - frac{0.3614}{2pi} < n < frac{3}{2} + frac{1}{8} - frac{0.3614}{2pi}]Numerically:[0.125 - 0.0575 approx 0.0675 < n < 1.5 + 0.125 - 0.0575 approx 1.5675]So, (n) can be 1.For the second case:[frac{pi}{4} < pi - 0.3614 + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Subtract (pi - 0.3614):[frac{pi}{4} - (pi - 0.3614) < 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4} - (pi - 0.3614)]Simplify:[-frac{3pi}{4} + 0.3614 < 2pi n < 2pi + frac{pi}{4} + 0.3614]Divide by (2pi):[-frac{3}{8} + frac{0.3614}{2pi} < n < 1 + frac{1}{8} + frac{0.3614}{2pi}]Numerically:[-0.375 + 0.0575 approx -0.3175 < n < 1.125 + 0.0575 approx 1.1825]So, (n) can be 0 or 1.Checking the solutions:For (n = 1) in the first case:(x = 0.3614 + 2pi(1) approx 0.3614 + 6.283 approx 6.644), which is valid.For (n = 0) in the second case:(x = pi - 0.3614 approx 3.0 - 0.3614 approx 2.6386), which is valid.For (n = 1) in the second case:(x = pi - 0.3614 + 2pi(1) approx 2.6386 + 6.283 approx 8.9216), which is valid.So, again, three solutions for (k = 1).Wait, so perhaps for each (k), we have three solutions? But that can't be right because when (k) is such that (c) is near 1 or -1, the number of solutions might decrease.Let me check (k = 3):(c = frac{1 + 2(3)}{6sqrt{2}} = frac{7}{6sqrt{2}} approx frac{7}{8.485} approx 0.825)So, (arcsin c approx arcsin(0.825) approx 0.977) radians.Now, let's find (n) for the first case:[frac{pi}{4} < 0.977 + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Subtract 0.977:[frac{pi}{4} - 0.977 < 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4} - 0.977]Divide by (2pi):[frac{1}{8} - frac{0.977}{2pi} < n < frac{3}{2} + frac{1}{8} - frac{0.977}{2pi}]Numerically:[0.125 - 0.155 approx -0.03 < n < 1.5 + 0.125 - 0.155 approx 1.47]So, (n) can be 0 or 1.For the second case:[frac{pi}{4} < pi - 0.977 + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Subtract (pi - 0.977):[frac{pi}{4} - (pi - 0.977) < 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4} - (pi - 0.977)]Simplify:[-frac{3pi}{4} + 0.977 < 2pi n < 2pi + frac{pi}{4} + 0.977]Divide by (2pi):[-frac{3}{8} + frac{0.977}{2pi} < n < 1 + frac{1}{8} + frac{0.977}{2pi}]Numerically:[-0.375 + 0.155 approx -0.22 < n < 1.125 + 0.155 approx 1.28]So, (n) can be 0 or 1.Checking the solutions:For (n = 0) in the first case:(x = 0.977 + 2pi(0) approx 0.977), which is greater than (frac{pi}{4} approx 0.785), so valid.For (n = 1) in the first case:(x = 0.977 + 2pi(1) approx 0.977 + 6.283 approx 7.26), which is valid.For (n = 0) in the second case:(x = pi - 0.977 approx 3.0 - 0.977 approx 2.023), which is valid.For (n = 1) in the second case:(x = pi - 0.977 + 2pi(1) approx 2.023 + 6.283 approx 8.306), which is valid.So, for (k = 3), we have four solutions? Wait, that can't be right because the interval is (3pi), which is one and a half periods. How can we have four solutions?Wait, no. Let me recount. For (k = 3), (c approx 0.825). The equation (sin x = 0.825) will have two solutions in each (2pi) interval. In the interval (frac{pi}{4}) to (3pi + frac{pi}{4}), which is (3pi), we have one and a half periods. So, in the first (2pi), two solutions, and in the next (pi), one solution. So, total three solutions.But according to the calculations above, we have four solutions. That must be a mistake. Let me check the values:For (n = 0) in the first case: (x = 0.977), which is within (frac{pi}{4} approx 0.785) and (3pi + frac{pi}{4} approx 10.21). So, valid.For (n = 1) in the first case: (x = 7.26), which is within the interval.For (n = 0) in the second case: (x = 2.023), valid.For (n = 1) in the second case: (x = 8.306), valid.So, four solutions. But that contradicts the expectation of three solutions. Hmm, perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong. Maybe in some cases, there are four solutions?Wait, let me think about the graph again. If (c) is close to 1, the sine function will cross (c) once on the rising part and once on the falling part in the first (2pi), and then in the next (pi), it will cross once on the rising part again. So, total three solutions. But according to the calculations, we have four solutions. That suggests that my method is overcounting.Wait, perhaps because when (c) is close to 1, the solutions in the second case for (n = 1) might actually fall outside the interval. Let me check the exact values.For (k = 3), (c approx 0.825), (arcsin c approx 0.977).First case:1. (n = 0): (x = 0.977), which is valid.2. (n = 1): (x = 0.977 + 6.283 approx 7.26), valid.Second case:1. (n = 0): (x = pi - 0.977 approx 2.023), valid.2. (n = 1): (x = 2.023 + 6.283 approx 8.306), valid.So, all four solutions are within the interval. But that would mean four solutions for (k = 3), which contradicts the earlier expectation. So, perhaps my initial assumption about the number of solutions was incorrect.Wait, maybe it's because when (c) is positive, the solutions in the second case for (n = 1) fall within the interval, leading to four solutions. But that seems contradictory to the periodicity.Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that when (c) is positive, the solutions in the second case for (n = 1) are actually in the next period, but still within the interval of (3pi). So, in this case, it's possible to have four solutions.But that seems inconsistent with the periodicity. Let me check with (k = 4), but wait, earlier we found that (k) can only go up to 3 because (6sqrt{2} approx 8.485), so (1 + 2k leq 8.485), so (k leq 3.7425), so (k = 3) is the maximum.Similarly, for (k = -4):(c = frac{1 + 2(-4)}{6sqrt{2}} = frac{-7}{6sqrt{2}} approx -0.825)So, (arcsin c approx -0.977) radians.Now, let's find (n) for the first case:[frac{pi}{4} < -0.977 + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Add 0.977:[frac{pi}{4} + 0.977 < 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4} + 0.977]Divide by (2pi):[frac{1}{8} + frac{0.977}{2pi} < n < frac{3}{2} + frac{1}{8} + frac{0.977}{2pi}]Numerically:[0.125 + 0.155 approx 0.28 < n < 1.5 + 0.125 + 0.155 approx 1.78]So, (n) can be 1.For the second case:[frac{pi}{4} < pi - (-0.977) + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Simplify:[frac{pi}{4} < pi + 0.977 + 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4}]Subtract (pi + 0.977):[frac{pi}{4} - pi - 0.977 < 2pi n < 3pi + frac{pi}{4} - pi - 0.977]Simplify:[-frac{3pi}{4} - 0.977 < 2pi n < 2pi + frac{pi}{4} - 0.977]Divide by (2pi):[-frac{3}{8} - frac{0.977}{2pi} < n < 1 + frac{1}{8} - frac{0.977}{2pi}]Numerically:[-0.375 - 0.155 approx -0.53 < n < 1.125 - 0.155 approx 0.97]So, (n) can be 0.Checking the solutions:For (n = 1) in the first case:(x = -0.977 + 2pi(1) approx -0.977 + 6.283 approx 5.306), which is valid.For (n = 0) in the second case:(x = pi - (-0.977) approx 3.0 + 0.977 approx 3.977), which is valid.So, for (k = -4), we have two solutions.Wait, so for (k = -4), we have two solutions, while for (k = 0, 1, 3), we have three or four solutions. This inconsistency suggests that the number of solutions varies depending on (k).But this complicates the counting. Maybe a better approach is to consider that for each (k), the equation (sin x = c) will have two solutions in each (2pi) interval, and in the interval of (3pi), which is one and a half periods, it will have three solutions if (c) is such that it crosses three times, or two solutions if it only crosses twice.But how can we determine for each (k) whether it's two or three solutions?Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the number of solutions is actually two per (k), leading to a total of 16 solutions (8 values of (k), two solutions each). But that contradicts the earlier example where (k = 0) had three solutions.Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that for each (k), the equation (sin x = c) will have two solutions in the interval ((frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4})) if (c) is within ((-1, 1)), which it is for all (k) from (-4) to (3). Therefore, each (k) gives two solutions, leading to a total of (8 times 2 = 16) solutions.But earlier, for (k = 0), I found three solutions, which suggests that this approach is incorrect.Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because when (c) is such that the solutions fall exactly at the boundaries of the interval, but in reality, the interval is open at 0 and (3pi), so we have to be careful.Alternatively, perhaps the correct number of solutions is indeed 16, as each (k) gives two solutions, and there are 8 values of (k). But I need to verify this.Wait, let me think about the general case. For each (k), the equation (sin x = c) will have two solutions in each (2pi) interval. Since our interval is (3pi), which is one and a half (2pi) intervals, it's possible to have three solutions if the value of (c) is such that it's crossed three times. However, in reality, for each (k), the equation will have two solutions in the interval ((frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4})), because the sine function is symmetric and periodic, and the interval is more than (2pi), but less than (4pi). Therefore, it's possible to have two solutions per (k), leading to a total of 16 solutions.But wait, in the example with (k = 0), I found three solutions, which contradicts this. So, perhaps the correct answer is 16 solutions, but I need to reconcile this with the earlier example.Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the number of solutions is indeed 16, with each (k) contributing two solutions. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 16.But I'm still confused because for some (k), I found three solutions. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that for each (k), the equation (sin x = c) will have two solutions in the interval ((frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4})), regardless of the value of (c), as long as (|c| < 1). Therefore, with 8 values of (k), each giving two solutions, the total number of solutions is 16.But in the example with (k = 0), I found three solutions, which suggests that this approach is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the correct number of solutions is 16, but I need to verify this.Alternatively, perhaps the correct number of solutions is 16, as each (k) gives two solutions, and there are 8 values of (k). Therefore, the total number of solutions is 16.But I'm still unsure because of the earlier example. Maybe I should consider that for each (k), the equation (sin x = c) will have two solutions in the interval ((frac{pi}{4}, 3pi + frac{pi}{4})), leading to 16 solutions in total.Therefore, the final answer is (boxed{16})."},{"question":"a train 90 m long running at 56 kmph crosses a platform in 18 sec . what is the length of the platform ?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total distance the train travels while crossing the platform.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the given equation:[ x + 2y - xy = 0 ]I can rearrange this equation to make it a bit simpler. Let's move the ( xy ) term to the other side:[ x + 2y = xy ]So, ( x + 2y ) is equal to ( xy ). Interesting. Now, the problem is asking for the minimum value of ( x + 2y ). Since ( x + 2y = xy ), I can say that we need to find the minimum value of ( xy ) given that ( x ) and ( y ) are positive real numbers.Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the minimum of ( x + 2y ), which is equal to ( xy ). So, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and then find the minimum.Let me try to solve for one variable. Let's solve for ( x ) in terms of ( y ). From the equation ( x + 2y = xy ), I can write:[ x = frac{2y}{y - 1} ]Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. Starting from ( x + 2y = xy ), if I move all terms to one side:[ xy - x - 2y = 0 ]Factor out ( x ) from the first two terms:[ x(y - 1) - 2y = 0 ]Then, moving ( 2y ) to the other side:[ x(y - 1) = 2y ]So, solving for ( x ):[ x = frac{2y}{y - 1} ]Hmm, that seems correct. But since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive real numbers, the denominator ( y - 1 ) must be positive because ( x ) is positive. So, ( y - 1 > 0 ) implies ( y > 1 ). That's important.So, ( y > 1 ), and ( x = frac{2y}{y - 1} ). Now, since ( x + 2y = xy ), and we need to find the minimum of ( x + 2y ), which is equal to ( xy ). So, perhaps I can express ( xy ) in terms of ( y ) only and then find its minimum.Let me compute ( xy ):[ xy = x cdot y = left( frac{2y}{y - 1} right) cdot y = frac{2y^2}{y - 1} ]So, ( xy = frac{2y^2}{y - 1} ). Now, I need to find the minimum value of this expression for ( y > 1 ).To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of ( xy ) with respect to ( y ) and set it equal to zero. Let's denote ( f(y) = frac{2y^2}{y - 1} ). Then, the derivative ( f'(y) ) is:Using the quotient rule: ( f'(y) = frac{(4y)(y - 1) - 2y^2(1)}{(y - 1)^2} )Let me compute the numerator:[ 4y(y - 1) - 2y^2 = 4y^2 - 4y - 2y^2 = 2y^2 - 4y ]So, the derivative is:[ f'(y) = frac{2y^2 - 4y}{(y - 1)^2} ]To find critical points, set ( f'(y) = 0 ):[ 2y^2 - 4y = 0 ][ 2y(y - 2) = 0 ]So, ( y = 0 ) or ( y = 2 ). But since ( y > 1 ), we discard ( y = 0 ) and take ( y = 2 ).Now, let's check if this is a minimum. We can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign of the first derivative around ( y = 2 ).Let me compute the second derivative ( f''(y) ). But before that, maybe it's easier to analyze the sign of ( f'(y) ) around ( y = 2 ).For ( y ) slightly less than 2, say ( y = 1.5 ):Numerator: ( 2*(1.5)^2 - 4*(1.5) = 2*2.25 - 6 = 4.5 - 6 = -1.5 ) which is negative.For ( y ) slightly more than 2, say ( y = 2.5 ):Numerator: ( 2*(2.5)^2 - 4*(2.5) = 2*6.25 - 10 = 12.5 - 10 = 2.5 ) which is positive.So, the derivative changes from negative to positive at ( y = 2 ), indicating a minimum at ( y = 2 ).Therefore, the minimum occurs at ( y = 2 ). Now, let's find the corresponding ( x ):[ x = frac{2y}{y - 1} = frac{2*2}{2 - 1} = frac{4}{1} = 4 ]So, ( x = 4 ) and ( y = 2 ). Now, let's compute ( x + 2y ):[ x + 2y = 4 + 2*2 = 4 + 4 = 8 ]So, the minimum value of ( x + 2y ) is 8.Wait, let me just double-check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using inequalities like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz, which might be more straightforward.Looking back at the equation ( x + 2y = xy ), perhaps I can manipulate it to apply AM-GM.Let me rewrite the equation:[ xy - x - 2y = 0 ]Adding 2 to both sides:[ xy - x - 2y + 2 = 2 ]Factor the left side:[ (x - 2)(y - 1) = 2 ]Hmm, that's interesting. So, ( (x - 2)(y - 1) = 2 ). Now, since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive, ( x - 2 ) and ( y - 1 ) must also be positive because their product is positive (2). So, ( x > 2 ) and ( y > 1 ), which aligns with our earlier conclusion.Now, let me denote ( a = x - 2 ) and ( b = y - 1 ). Then, ( a > 0 ) and ( b > 0 ), and the equation becomes:[ ab = 2 ]We need to find the minimum of ( x + 2y ). Let's express ( x + 2y ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ):[ x = a + 2 ][ y = b + 1 ][ x + 2y = (a + 2) + 2(b + 1) = a + 2 + 2b + 2 = a + 2b + 4 ]So, ( x + 2y = a + 2b + 4 ). Now, since ( ab = 2 ), we can express ( a = frac{2}{b} ). Substituting into the expression:[ x + 2y = frac{2}{b} + 2b + 4 ]Now, we need to find the minimum of ( frac{2}{b} + 2b + 4 ) for ( b > 0 ). Let's denote ( g(b) = frac{2}{b} + 2b + 4 ).To find the minimum, take the derivative of ( g(b) ) with respect to ( b ):[ g'(b) = -frac{2}{b^2} + 2 ]Set ( g'(b) = 0 ):[ -frac{2}{b^2} + 2 = 0 ][ 2 = frac{2}{b^2} ][ 2b^2 = 2 ][ b^2 = 1 ][ b = 1 ] (since ( b > 0 ))So, ( b = 1 ). Then, ( a = frac{2}{b} = 2 ). Therefore, ( x = a + 2 = 4 ) and ( y = b + 1 = 2 ), which is the same result as before. Thus, ( x + 2y = 8 ).Alternatively, using AM-GM inequality on ( frac{2}{b} ) and ( 2b ):We have two positive terms ( frac{2}{b} ) and ( 2b ). The AM-GM inequality states that:[ frac{frac{2}{b} + 2b}{2} geq sqrt{frac{2}{b} cdot 2b} ][ frac{frac{2}{b} + 2b}{2} geq sqrt{4} ][ frac{frac{2}{b} + 2b}{2} geq 2 ][ frac{2}{b} + 2b geq 4 ]Equality holds when ( frac{2}{b} = 2b ), which implies ( b = 1 ). Therefore, the minimum of ( frac{2}{b} + 2b ) is 4, and adding 4 gives the minimum of ( x + 2y ) as 8.So, whether I use calculus or the AM-GM inequality, I arrive at the same conclusion that the minimum value of ( x + 2y ) is 8, achieved when ( x = 4 ) and ( y = 2 ).I think this makes sense. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't miss anything.1. Start with the equation ( x + 2y - xy = 0 ).2. Rearranged to ( x + 2y = xy ).3. Expressed ( x ) in terms of ( y ) and found that ( y > 1 ).4. Expressed ( xy ) in terms of ( y ) and found the minimum using calculus.5. Alternatively, transformed the equation into ( (x - 2)(y - 1) = 2 ) and used substitution to express ( x + 2y ) in terms of a single variable, then applied AM-GM inequality to find the minimum.Both methods led to the same result, so I'm confident that 8 is the correct minimum value.**Final Answer**The minimum value of ( x + 2y ) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"if the price of petrol increases by 25 , by how much must a user cut down his consumption so that his expenditure on petrol remains constant ?","answer":"First, I need to understand the problem.

The total expenditure initially is ( P times C ).After a 25% increase, the new price becomes ( P + 0.25P = 1.25P ) per unit.To maintain the same expenditure, the new consumption ( C_{text{new}} ) must satisfy:[1.25P times C_{text{new}} = P times C]Solving for ( C_{text{new}} ):[C_{text{new}} = frac{P times C}{1.25P} = frac{C}{1.25} = 0.8C]This means the user must reduce their consumption by 20% to keep the expenditure constant."},{"question":"Wyatt's mother gave him 74 to go to the store.

Hmm, prime factors... right, those are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number, which is 120 in this case. And \\"distinct\\" means I should count each prime number only once, even if it appears multiple times in the factorization.Alright, let's start by recalling what prime numbers are. They are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the prime numbers less than 120 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. But since we're dealing with 120, I probably won't need to go too far down the list.First, I remember that 120 is an even number, which means it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 120 by 2:120 √∑ 2 = 60Okay, so 2 is a prime factor. Now, 60 is still even, so I can divide by 2 again:60 √∑ 2 = 30Still even, so another division by 2:30 √∑ 2 = 15Now, 15 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2 anymore. Let's move to the next prime number, which is 3.15 √∑ 3 = 5Great, 3 is another prime factor. Now, 5 is a prime number itself, so I can divide by 5:5 √∑ 5 = 1Alright, so now I've broken down 120 into prime factors: 2, 2, 2, 3, and 5. But since we're looking for distinct prime factors, I just need to count each unique prime number in this list.Looking at the factors: 2, 3, and 5. Each of these appears at least once in the factorization, and there are no other prime numbers involved. So, the distinct prime factors of 120 are 2, 3, and 5.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Starting from the beginning: 120 divided by 2 three times gives me 15, which then breaks down into 3 and 5. There are no other primes involved in this process. So, yes, I think that's all of them.Just to be thorough, I'll list out the factors again:- 2 (three times)- 3 (once)- 5 (once)And that's it. No other primes are needed to reach 120 when multiplied together. So, the distinct prime factors are indeed 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, there are three distinct prime factors of 120.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step logically follows, and I've accounted for all possible prime factors. It's always good to go through the process step by step to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with prime factorization. This method helps prevent missing any factors or counting duplicates unnecessarily.So, to recap:1. Start with 120.2. Divide by 2 until it's no longer even: 120 √∑ 2 = 60, 60 √∑ 2 = 30, 30 √∑ 2 = 15.3. Move to the next prime number, 3: 15 √∑ 3 = 5.4. Finally, divide by 5: 5 √∑ 5 = 1.5. Collect the unique primes: 2, 3, 5.Yep, that's three distinct prime factors. I'm confident with this answer now."},{"question":"Given A={x|x^2-2x-3<0}, B={x|x^2-5x+6<0}.(1) Find A cap B;(2) If the solution set of the inequality x^2+ax+b<0 is A cap B, find the solution set of x^2+ax-b<0.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two parts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says:Given ( A = {x | x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0} ) and ( B = {x | x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0} ).Part (1) asks me to find ( A cap B ).Alright, so I need to find the intersection of sets A and B. To do that, I should first determine what each set A and B is.Starting with set A: ( x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0 ).I remember that to solve quadratic inequalities, I can factor the quadratic if possible, find the roots, and then determine the intervals where the quadratic is less than zero.Let me try to factor ( x^2 - 2x - 3 ).Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to -2. Hmm, that would be -3 and +1 because (-3) * 1 = -3 and (-3) + 1 = -2.So, the quadratic factors as ( (x - 3)(x + 1) ).Therefore, the inequality becomes ( (x - 3)(x + 1) < 0 ).To find where this product is less than zero, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are at x = -1 and x = 3.So, the intervals to test are:1. ( x < -1 )2. ( -1 < x < 3 )3. ( x > 3 )Testing each interval:1. If x is less than -1, say x = -2: ( (-2 - 3)(-2 + 1) = (-5)(-1) = 5 ), which is positive.2. If x is between -1 and 3, say x = 0: ( (0 - 3)(0 + 1) = (-3)(1) = -3 ), which is negative.3. If x is greater than 3, say x = 4: ( (4 - 3)(4 + 1) = (1)(5) = 5 ), which is positive.Since we're looking for where the product is less than zero, the solution is the interval where the product is negative: ( -1 < x < 3 ).So, set A is ( (-1, 3) ).Now, moving on to set B: ( x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0 ).Again, I'll try to factor the quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. That would be -2 and -3.So, the quadratic factors as ( (x - 2)(x - 3) ).The inequality becomes ( (x - 2)(x - 3) < 0 ).Again, using a sign chart, the critical points are x = 2 and x = 3.Intervals to test:1. ( x < 2 )2. ( 2 < x < 3 )3. ( x > 3 )Testing each interval:1. If x is less than 2, say x = 1: ( (1 - 2)(1 - 3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 ), which is positive.2. If x is between 2 and 3, say x = 2.5: ( (2.5 - 2)(2.5 - 3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 ), which is negative.3. If x is greater than 3, say x = 4: ( (4 - 2)(4 - 3) = (2)(1) = 2 ), which is positive.We're looking for where the product is less than zero, so the solution is the interval where it's negative: ( 2 < x < 3 ).Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.Wait, the quadratic is ( x^2 - 5x + 6 ), which factors to ( (x - 2)(x - 3) ). So, when x is less than 2, both factors are negative, so the product is positive. Between 2 and 3, one factor is positive and the other is negative, so the product is negative. Greater than 3, both factors are positive, so the product is positive. So, the solution is indeed ( 2 < x < 3 ). So set B is ( (2, 3) ).Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the user wrote that B is ( {x | x < 2 text{ or } x > 3} ). Hmm, that seems contradictory to what I just found. Did I make a mistake?Wait, no, let me check again. The inequality is ( x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0 ). The quadratic opens upwards, so it's negative between its roots. So, the solution should be between 2 and 3, not outside. So, the user might have made a mistake in their initial problem statement? Or perhaps I misread it.Wait, let me check the original problem again.The user wrote: \\"Given ( A = {x | x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0} ), ( B = {x | x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0} ).\\"So, set A is ( (-1, 3) ), and set B is ( (2, 3) ). Therefore, the intersection ( A cap B ) would be ( (2, 3) ).But in the initial solution provided by the user, they wrote that set B is ( {x | x < 2 text{ or } x > 3} ), which would mean that set B is the union of ( (-infty, 2) ) and ( (3, infty) ). But that would be the case if the inequality was ( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 ), not less than zero.So, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial problem statement, or perhaps I misread it. Wait, let me check the original problem again.Wait, the user wrote: \\"Given ( A = {x | x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0} ), ( B = {x | x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0} ).\\"So, both inequalities are less than zero. Therefore, both A and B are intervals between their roots.Thus, A is ( (-1, 3) ), and B is ( (2, 3) ). Therefore, their intersection would be ( (2, 3) ).But in the initial solution provided, the user wrote that ( A cap B = (-1, 2) ), which suggests that they considered set B as ( (-infty, 2) cup (3, infty) ), which would be the case if the inequality was ( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 ).So, perhaps there was a typo in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it.Wait, let me check the original problem again.The user wrote: \\"Given ( A = {x | x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0} ), ( B = {x | x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0} ).\\"So, both inequalities are less than zero.

Maybe I should double-check my work.Wait, let me solve set B again.Set B: ( x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0 ).Factor: ( (x - 2)(x - 3) < 0 ).Critical points at x = 2 and x = 3.Test intervals:1. x < 2: pick x = 1: (1 - 2)(1 - 3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 02. 2 < x < 3: pick x = 2.5: (2.5 - 2)(2.5 - 3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 03. x > 3: pick x = 4: (4 - 2)(4 - 3) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0So, the solution is where the product is negative: 2 < x < 3.Therefore, set B is ( (2, 3) ).Thus, ( A = (-1, 3) ), ( B = (2, 3) ), so ( A cap B = (2, 3) ).But the initial solution provided by the user says ( A cap B = (-1, 2) ), which is incorrect based on this.Alternatively, perhaps the user intended set B to be ( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 ), which would make B ( (-infty, 2) cup (3, infty) ), and then ( A cap B ) would be ( (-1, 2) ).Given that, perhaps the user made a typo in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it.Wait, let me check the original problem again.The user wrote: \\"Given ( A = {x | x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0} ), ( B = {x | x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0} ).\\"So, both inequalities are less than zero. Therefore, both A and B are intervals between their roots.Thus, A is ( (-1, 3) ), and B is ( (2, 3) ). Therefore, their intersection would be ( (2, 3) ).But in the initial solution provided, the user wrote that ( A cap B = (-1, 2) ), which suggests that they considered set B as ( (-infty, 2) cup (3, infty) ), which would be the case if the inequality was ( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 ).So, perhaps there was a typo in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it.Alternatively, perhaps the user intended set B to be ( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 ), which would make B ( (-infty, 2) cup (3, infty) ), and then ( A cap B ) would be ( (-1, 2) ).Given that, perhaps I should proceed assuming that set B is ( (-infty, 2) cup (3, infty) ), as per the initial solution.But that would mean that the inequality for set B is ( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 ), not less than zero.Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the initial solution provided by the user, assuming that set B is ( (-infty, 2) cup (3, infty) ), even though that contradicts the given inequality.Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial solution.Given that, perhaps I should proceed with the correct solution based on the given inequalities.Thus, set A is ( (-1, 3) ), set B is ( (2, 3) ), so their intersection is ( (2, 3) ).But in the initial solution, the user wrote ( A cap B = (-1, 2) ), which is incorrect.Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial solution.Given that, perhaps I should proceed with the correct solution.So, for part (1), ( A cap B = (2, 3) ).Now, moving on to part (2):\\"If the solution set of the inequality ( x^2 + ax + b < 0 ) is ( A cap B ), find the solution set of ( x^2 + ax - b < 0 ).\\"Wait, in the initial solution, the user wrote that the solution set of ( x^2 + ax + b < 0 ) is ( A cap B ), which they incorrectly found as ( (-1, 2) ), and then they proceeded to find a and b accordingly.But based on my correct solution, ( A cap B = (2, 3) ).Therefore, the quadratic inequality ( x^2 + ax + b < 0 ) has solution set ( (2, 3) ).Thus, the quadratic must have roots at x = 2 and x = 3, and since the solution is between the roots, the quadratic must open upwards.Therefore, the quadratic can be written as ( (x - 2)(x - 3) = x^2 - 5x + 6 ).Therefore, comparing to ( x^2 + ax + b ), we have:( x^2 + ax + b = x^2 - 5x + 6 ).Thus, ( a = -5 ) and ( b = 6 ).Wait, but in the initial solution, the user wrote that the roots are -1 and 2, leading to a = -1 and b = -2, which is incorrect.Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial solution.Given that, perhaps I should proceed with the correct values of a and b.So, given that ( A cap B = (2, 3) ), the quadratic inequality ( x^2 + ax + b < 0 ) has solution set ( (2, 3) ).Therefore, the quadratic must have roots at 2 and 3, and since the solution is between the roots, the quadratic opens upwards.Thus, the quadratic is ( (x - 2)(x - 3) = x^2 - 5x + 6 ).Therefore, ( x^2 + ax + b = x^2 - 5x + 6 ), so ( a = -5 ) and ( b = 6 ).Now, we need to find the solution set of ( x^2 + ax - b < 0 ).Substituting a and b, we get:( x^2 + (-5)x - 6 < 0 ), which simplifies to ( x^2 - 5x - 6 < 0 ).Now, let's solve this inequality.First, factor the quadratic if possible.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to -5.Those numbers are -6 and +1.So, the quadratic factors as ( (x - 6)(x + 1) ).Thus, the inequality becomes ( (x - 6)(x + 1) < 0 ).Now, find the critical points: x = -1 and x = 6.Test the intervals:1. ( x < -1 ): pick x = -2: ( (-2 - 6)(-2 + 1) = (-8)(-1) = 8 > 0 )2. ( -1 < x < 6 ): pick x = 0: ( (0 - 6)(0 + 1) = (-6)(1) = -6 < 0 )3. ( x > 6 ): pick x = 7: ( (7 - 6)(7 + 1) = (1)(8) = 8 > 0 )We're looking for where the product is less than zero, so the solution is ( -1 < x < 6 ).Therefore, the solution set of ( x^2 + ax - b < 0 ) is ( (-1, 6) ).But in the initial solution, the user wrote that the solution set is ( (-infty, -1) cup (2, infty) ), which is incorrect based on this.Therefore, the correct solution set is ( (-1, 6) ).Wait, but let me double-check my work.Given that ( A cap B = (2, 3) ), the quadratic ( x^2 + ax + b < 0 ) has roots at 2 and 3, so ( a = -5 ), ( b = 6 ).Then, ( x^2 + ax - b < 0 ) becomes ( x^2 - 5x - 6 < 0 ), which factors to ( (x - 6)(x + 1) < 0 ).The critical points are x = -1 and x = 6.Testing intervals:1. x < -1: positive2. -1 < x < 6: negative3. x > 6: positiveThus, the solution is ( -1 < x < 6 ).Therefore, the solution set is ( (-1, 6) ).But in the initial solution, the user wrote that the solution set is ( (-infty, -1) cup (2, infty) ), which is incorrect.Therefore, the correct answer for part (2) is ( (-1, 6) ).Wait, but in the initial solution, the user wrote that the solution set is ( (-infty, -1) cup (2, infty) ), which is the solution set for ( x^2 - x - 2 < 0 ), which factors to ( (x - 2)(x + 1) < 0 ), giving solution ( x < -1 ) or ( x > 2 ).But that would be the case if a = -1 and b = -2, which is incorrect.Therefore, the initial solution provided by the user is incorrect.Given that, perhaps I should proceed with the correct solution.Thus, for part (1), ( A cap B = (2, 3) ).For part (2), the solution set of ( x^2 + ax - b < 0 ) is ( (-1, 6) ).But wait, let me double-check the quadratic.Given ( x^2 + ax + b < 0 ) has solution ( (2, 3) ), so the quadratic is ( (x - 2)(x - 3) = x^2 - 5x + 6 ), so ( a = -5 ), ( b = 6 ).Then, ( x^2 + ax - b = x^2 - 5x - 6 ), which factors to ( (x - 6)(x + 1) ).Thus, the inequality ( (x - 6)(x + 1) < 0 ) has solution ( -1 < x < 6 ).Therefore, the solution set is ( (-1, 6) ).Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the final answers are:(1) ( A cap B = boxed{(-1, 2)} ) ‚Äì Wait, no, based on my correct solution, it's ( (2, 3) ). But in the initial solution, the user wrote ( (-1, 2) ), which is incorrect.Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile this.Given the confusion, perhaps the user intended set B to be ( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 ), making B ( (-infty, 2) cup (3, infty) ), and then ( A cap B = (-1, 2) ).In that case, the quadratic ( x^2 + ax + b < 0 ) would have solution ( (-1, 2) ), so the quadratic would be ( (x + 1)(x - 2) = x^2 - x - 2 ), giving ( a = -1 ), ( b = -2 ).Then, ( x^2 + ax - b = x^2 - x + 2 ), which would be ( x^2 - x + 2 < 0 ).But wait, the discriminant of ( x^2 - x + 2 ) is ( (-1)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 1 - 8 = -7 ), which is negative, meaning the quadratic is always positive. Therefore, the inequality ( x^2 - x + 2 < 0 ) has no solution.But in the initial solution, the user wrote that the solution set is ( (-infty, -1) cup (2, infty) ), which is incorrect because the quadratic ( x^2 - x - 2 < 0 ) has solution ( (-1, 2) ), but that's a different quadratic.Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial solution.Given that, perhaps I should proceed with the correct solution based on the given inequalities.Thus, for part (1), ( A cap B = (2, 3) ).For part (2), the solution set of ( x^2 + ax - b < 0 ) is ( (-1, 6) ).Therefore, the final answers are:(1) ( A cap B = boxed{(2, 3)} )(2) The solution set of ( x^2 + ax - b < 0 ) is ( boxed{(-1, 6)} )But wait, in the initial solution, the user wrote:(1) ( A cap B = boxed{{x | -1 < x < 2}} )(2) The solution set of ( x^2 + ax - b < 0 ) is ( boxed{{x | x < -1 text{ or } x > 2}} )Which is incorrect based on the correct solution.Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial solution, and I should provide the correct answers."},{"question":"The statement \\"The equation of line l is x-y-5=0\\" is a („ÄÄ„ÄÄ) condition for \\"Line l bisects the circumference of the circle (x-2)^2+(y+3)^2=1\\".A: Sufficient but not necessaryB: Necessary but not sufficientC: Necessary and sufficientD: Neither sufficient nor necessary","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a line and a circle. It says: \\"The equation of line ( l ) is ( x - y - 5 = 0 )\\" is a („ÄÄ„ÄÄ) condition for \\"Line ( l ) bisects the circumference of the circle ( (x - 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 1 ).\\" The options are A: Sufficient but not necessary, B: Necessary but not sufficient, C: Necessary and sufficient, D: Neither sufficient nor necessary.Hmm, okay. I need to figure out whether the given equation of the line is a sufficient condition, necessary condition, both, or neither for the line to bisect the circumference of the given circle.First, let me recall what it means for a line to bisect the circumference of a circle. If a line bisects the circumference, it means that the line passes through the center of the circle. Because if it passes through the center, it will divide the circle into two equal arcs, hence bisecting the circumference. So, the key here is that the line must pass through the center of the circle.Given the circle equation ( (x - 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 1 ), I can determine its center. The standard form of a circle is ( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 ), where ( (h, k) ) is the center and ( r ) is the radius. So, comparing, the center of this circle is at ( (2, -3) ) and the radius is 1.Now, the line given is ( x - y - 5 = 0 ). Let me check if this line passes through the center of the circle. To do that, I can substitute the coordinates of the center into the line equation and see if it satisfies it.Substituting ( x = 2 ) and ( y = -3 ) into the line equation:( 2 - (-3) - 5 = 0 )Simplify:( 2 + 3 - 5 = 0 )( 5 - 5 = 0 )( 0 = 0 )Okay, so the center ( (2, -3) ) lies on the line ( x - y - 5 = 0 ). That means this line does pass through the center of the circle, so it should bisect the circumference. So, if the line is ( x - y - 5 = 0 ), then it definitely bisects the circumference. So, the condition is sufficient.But is it necessary? That is, is every line that bisects the circumference of this circle necessarily the line ( x - y - 5 = 0 )? I don't think so. Because any line that passes through the center ( (2, -3) ) will bisect the circumference. There are infinitely many lines that can pass through a single point. For example, another line could be ( y = x - 5 ), but wait, that's actually the same line as ( x - y - 5 = 0 ). Hmm, maybe another example: ( y = -x + c ) where ( c ) is chosen so that it passes through ( (2, -3) ). Let me see.Wait, no, ( x - y - 5 = 0 ) is a specific line. There are infinitely many lines passing through the center, each with different slopes. So, for instance, a vertical line ( x = 2 ) would also pass through the center and bisect the circumference. Similarly, a horizontal line ( y = -3 ) would do the same. Therefore, there are multiple lines that can bisect the circumference, not just ( x - y - 5 = 0 ). So, the condition of the line being ( x - y - 5 = 0 ) is sufficient because it guarantees that the line bisects the circumference, but it's not necessary because there are other lines that can also do the same.Therefore, the statement \\"The equation of line ( l ) is ( x - y - 5 = 0 )\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"Line ( l ) bisects the circumference of the circle ( (x - 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 1 ).\\"So, the correct answer should be option A: Sufficient but not necessary.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recap:1. A line bisecting the circumference of a circle must pass through the center.2. The given line passes through the center, so it bisects the circumference. Hence, it's sufficient.3. However, there are other lines that also pass through the center, so it's not necessary for the line to be ( x - y - 5 = 0 ) to bisect the circumference.Yes, that seems correct.

So, his estimated values are (a - d) and (b + d).Now, I need to compare the true value (a^2 - b^2) with Mahesh's estimate, which would be ((a - d)^2 - (b + d)^2). To do this, I should probably expand both expressions and see how they compare.Let me start by expanding the true value:[a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)]That's the difference of squares formula, which I remember from algebra. It factors into the product of the sum and difference of (a) and (b).Now, let's expand Mahesh's estimate:[(a - d)^2 - (b + d)^2]Again, using the difference of squares formula, this can be written as:[[(a - d) - (b + d)][(a - d) + (b + d)]]Simplifying inside the brackets:First bracket:[(a - d) - (b + d) = a - d - b - d = (a - b) - 2d]Second bracket:[(a - d) + (b + d) = a - d + b + d = a + b]So, Mahesh's estimate becomes:[[(a - b) - 2d][a + b]]Which is:[(a - b)(a + b) - 2d(a + b)]Wait, that looks familiar. The first term is exactly the true value (a^2 - b^2), and the second term is subtracting (2d(a + b)). So, Mahesh's estimate is:[a^2 - b^2 - 2d(a + b)]Since (a) and (b) are positive integers and (d) is a positive integer as well, the term (2d(a + b)) is definitely positive. Therefore, subtracting this positive term from the true value means that Mahesh's estimate is less than the actual value of (a^2 - b^2).Let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug in some numbers, say (a = 5), (b = 3), and (d = 1), then the true value is:[5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16]Mahesh's estimate would be:[(5 - 1)^2 - (3 + 1)^2 = 4^2 - 4^2 = 16 - 16 = 0]Wait, that's zero, which is definitely less than 16. Hmm, but in this case, (d = 1) is not that small relative to (a) and (b). Maybe I should try with a smaller (d), like (d = 0.5), but since (d) has to be an integer, let's try (d = 1) again but with larger numbers.Let me take (a = 10), (b = 6), and (d = 1). The true value is:[10^2 - 6^2 = 100 - 36 = 64]Mahesh's estimate is:[(10 - 1)^2 - (6 + 1)^2 = 9^2 - 7^2 = 81 - 49 = 32]32 is less than 64, so again, the estimate is lower. What if (d = 2)?True value remains 64.Estimate:[(10 - 2)^2 - (6 + 2)^2 = 8^2 - 8^2 = 64 - 64 = 0]Still less. It seems consistent that Mahesh's estimate is less than the true value. Maybe I should try a different set where (d) is smaller relative to (a) and (b).Let's say (a = 100), (b = 90), and (d = 1). True value:[100^2 - 90^2 = 10000 - 8100 = 1900]Estimate:[(100 - 1)^2 - (90 + 1)^2 = 99^2 - 91^2]Calculating:[99^2 = 9801][91^2 = 8281][9801 - 8281 = 1520]1520 is less than 1900. So, again, the estimate is lower.Wait, but in the first example with (a = 5), (b = 3), and (d = 1), the estimate was zero, which is a big difference. Maybe the effect is more pronounced when (d) is a larger proportion of (a) and (b). But regardless, in all these cases, the estimate is less than the true value.Let me think about why this is happening. When Mahesh rounds (a) down, he's decreasing the value of (a), which makes (a^2) smaller. At the same time, he's rounding (b) up, which makes (b^2) larger. So, both changes contribute to making the difference (a^2 - b^2) smaller. That makes sense.Mathematically, we saw that the estimate is:[a^2 - b^2 - 2d(a + b)]Since (2d(a + b)) is positive, subtracting it from (a^2 - b^2) makes the estimate smaller. Therefore, Mahesh's estimate is less than the true value.I think I'm confident with this conclusion now. It consistently shows that the estimate is less than the actual value, regardless of the specific values of (a), (b), and (d), as long as (a > b) and (d) is a positive integer."},{"question":"In a single-elimination tournament, each match is contested between two players, and only the winner advances to the next round.

(1) Find the value of sin xcos x;  (2) Find the value of sin x-cos x.","answer":"Okay, so I have this trigonometric equation: sin(x + œÄ) + cos(x - œÄ) = 1/2, and x is between 0 and œÄ. I need to find sin x cos x and sin x - cos x. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that trigonometric functions have certain identities when you add or subtract œÄ. For sine, sin(x + œÄ) is equal to -sin x because adding œÄ flips the sine value. Similarly, for cosine, cos(x - œÄ) is equal to -cos x because subtracting œÄ also flips the cosine value. So, substituting these into the equation, I get:sin(x + œÄ) + cos(x - œÄ) = -sin x - cos x = 1/2.So, that simplifies to -sin x - cos x = 1/2. If I multiply both sides by -1, I get sin x + cos x = -1/2. Okay, so sin x plus cos x equals -1/2. That seems manageable.Now, part (1) asks for sin x cos x. I remember that (sin x + cos x)^2 equals sin^2 x + 2 sin x cos x + cos^2 x. Since sin^2 x + cos^2 x is 1, this simplifies to 1 + 2 sin x cos x. So, if I square both sides of sin x + cos x = -1/2, I can find sin x cos x.Let me write that out:(sin x + cos x)^2 = (-1/2)^21 + 2 sin x cos x = 1/4Subtracting 1 from both sides:2 sin x cos x = 1/4 - 12 sin x cos x = -3/4Dividing both sides by 2:sin x cos x = -3/8Okay, so that's part (1). I think that's correct. Let me double-check. If sin x + cos x is -1/2, then squaring it gives 1/4, and subtracting 1 gives -3/4, so half of that is -3/8. Yep, that seems right.Now, part (2) asks for sin x - cos x. Hmm, I need to find the value of sin x - cos x. I remember that (sin x - cos x)^2 is equal to sin^2 x - 2 sin x cos x + cos^2 x, which simplifies to 1 - 2 sin x cos x. Since I already know sin x cos x is -3/8, I can plug that in.Let me compute that:(sin x - cos x)^2 = 1 - 2*(-3/8) = 1 + 6/8 = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4So, (sin x - cos x)^2 is 7/4. Taking the square root of both sides gives sin x - cos x = sqrt(7)/2 or -sqrt(7)/2. But I need to figure out the sign.Given that x is between 0 and œÄ, let's think about the values of sin x and cos x. In the interval (0, œÄ), sin x is always positive because it's above the x-axis. Cos x, on the other hand, is positive in (0, œÄ/2) and negative in (œÄ/2, œÄ). But from part (1), we have sin x + cos x = -1/2, which is negative. Since sin x is positive, cos x must be negative enough to make the sum negative. So, cos x is negative, which means x is in (œÄ/2, œÄ).Therefore, sin x is positive and cos x is negative. So, sin x - cos x is sin x minus a negative number, which is sin x + |cos x|. Both sin x and |cos x| are positive, so sin x - cos x is positive. Therefore, we take the positive square root.So, sin x - cos x = sqrt(7)/2.Let me recap:1. Starting with sin(x + œÄ) + cos(x - œÄ) = 1/2, I used the identities to simplify it to sin x + cos x = -1/2.2. Squared both sides to find sin x cos x, which turned out to be -3/8.3. For sin x - cos x, I used the identity involving (sin x - cos x)^2, substituted sin x cos x, and found it to be sqrt(7)/2.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident in these answers.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{-dfrac{3}{8}}  (2) boxed{dfrac{sqrt{7}}{2}}"},{"question":"Given a=log_{0.5}3, b=2^{0.5}, and c=0.5^{0.3}, determine the relationship among a, b, and c.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out the relationship between three values: a, b, and c. They're defined as follows:- ( a = log_{0.5}3 )- ( b = 2^{0.5} )- ( c = 0.5^{0.3} )I need to determine whether a is less than c, which is less than b, or some other order. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let's tackle ( a = log_{0.5}3 ). I remember that logarithms with bases less than 1 are decreasing functions. So, as the input increases, the output decreases. Since 3 is greater than 1, and the base is 0.5, this logarithm should be negative. That makes sense because ( 0.5^x = 3 ) would require x to be negative since 0.5 raised to a negative power is the same as 2 raised to a positive power, which would give a number greater than 1. So, ( a ) is negative.Next, ( b = 2^{0.5} ). That's the square root of 2, right? So, ( sqrt{2} ) is approximately 1.414. That's definitely greater than 1.Now, ( c = 0.5^{0.3} ). Hmm, 0.5 is the same as ( frac{1}{2} ), so ( left(frac{1}{2}right)^{0.3} ). Since the exponent is positive but less than 1, this should be a number between 0 and 1. Specifically, it's the 10th root of ( left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 ), which is ( left(frac{1}{8}right)^{0.1} ). But maybe it's easier to think of it as ( 2^{-0.3} ), which is approximately... let's see, ( 2^{-0.3} ) is about ( 1 / 2^{0.3} ). I know ( 2^{0.3} ) is less than 2, so ( 1 / 2^{0.3} ) is greater than 0.5. So, ( c ) is between 0.5 and 1.Putting it all together:- ( a ) is negative.- ( c ) is between 0.5 and 1.- ( b ) is approximately 1.414.So, the order from smallest to largest should be ( a < c < b ).Wait, let me double-check. For ( a = log_{0.5}3 ), I can convert this logarithm to a natural logarithm to get a better sense of its value. Using the change of base formula:( a = frac{ln 3}{ln 0.5} )Since ( ln 0.5 ) is negative, and ( ln 3 ) is positive, ( a ) is indeed negative. Specifically, ( ln 3 ) is about 1.0986, and ( ln 0.5 ) is about -0.6931. So,( a approx frac{1.0986}{-0.6931} approx -1.58496 )So, ( a ) is approximately -1.585.For ( c = 0.5^{0.3} ), let's calculate it more precisely. ( 0.5^{0.3} = e^{0.3 ln 0.5} ). ( ln 0.5 ) is approximately -0.6931, so:( 0.3 times (-0.6931) approx -0.2079 )Then, ( e^{-0.2079} approx 0.812 ). So, ( c ) is approximately 0.812.And ( b = 2^{0.5} approx 1.414 ).So, the order is definitely ( a < c < b ).I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was recognizing the properties of logarithms and exponents with bases less than 1, and then using approximate values to confirm the order."},{"question":"On the asymptotes of the hyperbola (C: frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0)), take one point each, (P) and (Q).

Let me try to understand the problem step by step.First, the hyperbola is given by the equation ( C: frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where ( a > 0 ) and ( b > 0 ). I know that for hyperbolas, the asymptotes are lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches. The equations of the asymptotes for this hyperbola should be ( y = pm frac{b}{a}x ). So, these are straight lines passing through the origin with slopes ( frac{b}{a} ) and ( -frac{b}{a} ).Now, the problem says that on each asymptote, we take one point each, named ( P ) and ( Q ). So, point ( P ) is on one asymptote, say ( y = frac{b}{a}x ), and point ( Q ) is on the other asymptote, ( y = -frac{b}{a}x ). Next, it mentions that the circle with diameter ( PQ ) always passes through the origin. Hmm, that's interesting. So, regardless of where we choose points ( P ) and ( Q ) on the asymptotes, the circle formed by taking ( PQ ) as the diameter will always pass through the origin. I need to figure out what this implies about the hyperbola's parameters ( a ) and ( b ), and then find the eccentricity.Let me recall that the eccentricity ( e ) of a hyperbola is given by ( e = frac{c}{a} ), where ( c ) is the distance from the center to each focus, and ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ). So, if I can find a relationship between ( a ) and ( b ), I can compute ( e ).Given that the circle with diameter ( PQ ) passes through the origin, I can use the property that if a circle has diameter ( PQ ), then for any point ( R ) on the circle, the angle ( angle PRQ ) is a right angle. In this case, the origin ( O ) is on the circle, so ( angle POQ ) should be a right angle.Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me think again. If the origin is on the circle with diameter ( PQ ), then the origin must satisfy the condition that ( OP ) is perpendicular to ( OQ ). Because in a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle. So, if ( O ) is on the circle, then ( OP ) and ( OQ ) must be perpendicular.So, the vectors ( OP ) and ( OQ ) must be perpendicular. That means their dot product is zero. Let me write that down.Let me denote point ( P ) as ( (x_1, y_1) ) on the asymptote ( y = frac{b}{a}x ), so ( y_1 = frac{b}{a}x_1 ). Similarly, point ( Q ) is on the asymptote ( y = -frac{b}{a}x ), so ( y_2 = -frac{b}{a}x_2 ).So, the coordinates are:- ( P = (x_1, frac{b}{a}x_1) )- ( Q = (x_2, -frac{b}{a}x_2) )Since the origin ( O ) is on the circle with diameter ( PQ ), the vectors ( OP ) and ( OQ ) must be perpendicular. Therefore, their dot product should be zero.Calculating the dot product:( OP cdot OQ = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = x_1x_2 + left( frac{b}{a}x_1 right)left( -frac{b}{a}x_2 right) )Simplify this:( x_1x_2 - frac{b^2}{a^2}x_1x_2 = 0 )Factor out ( x_1x_2 ):( x_1x_2 left( 1 - frac{b^2}{a^2} right) = 0 )Now, since ( P ) and ( Q ) are arbitrary points on the asymptotes, ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) can be any real numbers (except zero, because then the points would coincide with the origin, which might not be allowed). Therefore, the term ( x_1x_2 ) is not necessarily zero. So, the other factor must be zero:( 1 - frac{b^2}{a^2} = 0 )Solving this:( frac{b^2}{a^2} = 1 )( b^2 = a^2 )( b = a ) (since ( a > 0 ) and ( b > 0 ))So, ( b = a ). That's an important relationship. Now, let's recall that for a hyperbola, ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ). Since ( b = a ), substituting:( c^2 = a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2 )( c = sqrt{2a^2} = asqrt{2} )Therefore, the eccentricity ( e ) is:( e = frac{c}{a} = frac{asqrt{2}}{a} = sqrt{2} )So, the eccentricity is ( sqrt{2} ), which corresponds to option D.Wait, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I considered the asymptotes correctly: ( y = pm frac{b}{a}x ).2. I correctly identified points ( P ) and ( Q ) on each asymptote.3. I used the property that if the origin is on the circle with diameter ( PQ ), then ( OP ) is perpendicular to ( OQ ). That seems correct because the angle subtended by the diameter is a right angle.4. The dot product calculation led me to ( x_1x_2(1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}) = 0 ). Since ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) can be arbitrary, the factor ( 1 - frac{b^2}{a^2} ) must be zero, leading to ( b = a ).5. Then, using ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ), I found ( c = asqrt{2} ), so ( e = sqrt{2} ).Everything seems to check out.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.First, I notice that the expression is an alternating sum of binomial coefficients up to the 10th term. It starts with 1, subtracts (binom{90}{1}), adds (binom{90}{2}), and so on, alternating signs until the 10th term. So, it's like a partial expansion of a binomial theorem expression.Wait, the binomial theorem says that ((a + b)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k). If I set (a = 1) and (b = -1), then ((1 - 1)^{90} = sum_{k=0}^{90} binom{90}{k} (-1)^k). That would give me the alternating sum of all binomial coefficients from 0 to 90. But in my problem, the sum only goes up to 10. So, it's like a partial sum of that expansion.But I need to find the remainder when this partial sum is divided by 88. Hmm, maybe I can relate this partial sum to the full expansion somehow. Let me think.If I consider the full expansion ((1 - 1)^{90}), that's equal to 0, right? Because (1 - 1 = 0), and any power of 0 is 0. But that's the sum from (k=0) to (k=90). My sum only goes up to (k=10), so maybe I can express my partial sum as the full sum minus the sum from (k=11) to (k=90). But that might not be helpful because the full sum is 0, so my partial sum would be equal to the negative of the sum from (k=11) to (k=90). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can think of the partial sum as the expansion of ((1 - 1)^{10}) but with coefficients from 90 instead of 10. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the binomial coefficients depend on the upper index. So, (binom{90}{k}) is different from (binom{10}{k}).Wait, another thought: perhaps I can write the partial sum as part of the expansion of ((1 - 1)^{90}), but only taking the first 11 terms (from (k=0) to (k=10)). Since the full expansion is 0, maybe the partial sum is related to the remaining terms. But I'm not sure how that helps with modulo 88.Let me try another approach. Maybe I can compute each term modulo 88 and then add them up. That is, compute each (binom{90}{k}) modulo 88, multiply by ((-1)^k), and then sum them up. But computing binomial coefficients modulo 88 might be tricky, especially for large k.Wait, 88 is equal to 8 * 11, which are both prime powers. Maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. If I can find the remainder modulo 8 and modulo 11 separately, then I can combine them to get the remainder modulo 88. That might be a good strategy.So, let's try that. I'll compute the partial sum modulo 8 and modulo 11, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the combined remainder modulo 88.First, let's compute the partial sum modulo 8.Computing modulo 8:We have the expression (S = 1 - binom{90}{1} + binom{90}{2} - binom{90}{3} + ldots + (-1)^{10} binom{90}{10}).I need to compute each (binom{90}{k}) modulo 8, then multiply by ((-1)^k), and sum them up.But computing (binom{90}{k}) modulo 8 for k up to 10 might be manageable.First, let's note that 90 modulo 8 is 90 - 11*8 = 90 - 88 = 2. So, 90 ‚â° 2 mod 8.Similarly, 90 ‚â° 2 mod 8, so when computing binomial coefficients modulo 8, Lucas' theorem might be helpful. Lucas' theorem states that to compute (binom{n}{k}) modulo a prime power, we can express n and k in base p and multiply the binomial coefficients of their digits.But 8 is 2^3, so Lucas' theorem applies here. Let me recall Lucas' theorem.Lucas' theorem: For non-negative integers m and n and a prime p, if m and n are expressed in base p as (m = m_0 + m_1 p + m_2 p^2 + ldots + m_t p^t) and (n = n_0 + n_1 p + n_2 p^2 + ldots + n_t p^t), then[binom{m}{n} equiv prod_{i=0}^{t} binom{m_i}{n_i} mod p]But since we're working modulo 8, which is 2^3, we can extend Lucas' theorem to prime powers. However, Lucas' theorem in its basic form applies to primes, not prime powers. There are generalizations, but they are more complicated.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute (binom{90}{k}) modulo 8 directly for k up to 10.Let me compute each term:First, compute (binom{90}{0}): that's 1.(binom{90}{1}): 90.(binom{90}{2}): 90*89/2 = 4005.(binom{90}{3}): 90*89*88/(2*3) = 90*89*88/6.Wait, but computing these directly might not be efficient. Maybe I can compute each modulo 8.Since 90 ‚â° 2 mod 8, let's see:Compute (binom{90}{k} mod 8).But 90 is 2 mod 8, so let's think about how binomial coefficients behave modulo 8.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that (binom{n}{k} mod 2^m) can be computed using the binary representations.Wait, 8 is 2^3, so let's write 90 in binary.90 in binary: 64 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 64 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 90. So, 90 is 1011010 in binary.Similarly, k from 0 to 10 in binary:k=0: 0000k=1: 0001k=2: 0010k=3: 0011k=4: 0100k=5: 0101k=6: 0110k=7: 0111k=8: 1000k=9: 1001k=10: 1010Now, Lucas' theorem for prime powers is more complicated, but for 2^3, maybe we can use the following approach:Each binomial coefficient (binom{n}{k}) modulo 8 can be computed by considering the binary digits of n and k, and using the rule that if any bit of k is greater than the corresponding bit of n, the binomial coefficient is 0 modulo 2^3.Wait, no, that's Lucas' theorem for prime 2, but extended to higher powers.Wait, actually, Lucas' theorem for prime 2 says that (binom{n}{k} equiv prod binom{n_i}{k_i} mod 2), where n_i and k_i are the bits of n and k.But for modulo 8, which is 2^3, we can use a generalization. There's a theorem by Davis and Webb that gives the binomial coefficients modulo 2^m.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute each (binom{90}{k}) modulo 8 directly.Let me try that.Compute (binom{90}{k} mod 8) for k=0 to 10.First, note that 90 ‚â° 2 mod 8.Compute (binom{90}{0} = 1). 1 mod 8 is 1.(binom{90}{1} = 90). 90 mod 8 is 2.(binom{90}{2} = (90*89)/2 = (90/2)*89 = 45*89.Compute 45 mod 8: 45 - 5*8=45-40=5.89 mod 8: 89 - 11*8=89-88=1.So, 45*89 mod 8 is 5*1=5.So, (binom{90}{2} mod 8 =5).(binom{90}{3} = (90*89*88)/(2*3) = (90*89*88)/6.Compute numerator: 90*89*88.But let's compute modulo 8.90 ‚â° 2 mod 8, 89 ‚â° 1 mod 8, 88 ‚â° 0 mod 8.So, 2*1*0=0 mod 8.Thus, numerator is 0 mod 8, denominator is 6.But 0 divided by 6 is 0 mod 8.Wait, but division in modular arithmetic is multiplication by the inverse. Since 6 and 8 are not coprime, 6 doesn't have an inverse modulo 8. Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't working.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (binom{90}{3}) modulo 8 by another method.Wait, (binom{90}{3} = frac{90*89*88}{6}).Compute 90 mod 8=2, 89 mod 8=1, 88 mod 8=0.So, 2*1*0=0. Then, 0 divided by 6 is 0 mod 8.So, (binom{90}{3} mod 8 =0).Similarly, (binom{90}{4}):(binom{90}{4} = frac{90*89*88*87}{24}).Again, compute numerator modulo 8:90 ‚â°2, 89‚â°1, 88‚â°0, 87‚â°7.So, 2*1*0*7=0.Thus, numerator is 0 mod 8, denominator is 24.But 24 is 0 mod 8, so again, division isn't straightforward. However, since the numerator is 0, the entire expression is 0 mod 8.Wait, but actually, (binom{90}{4}) is an integer, so if the numerator is divisible by 24, then (binom{90}{4}) is an integer, but modulo 8, it's 0.Wait, but let me check with actual computation.Compute (binom{90}{4}):90*89*88*87 / (4*3*2*1) = (90*89*88*87)/24.But 88 is divisible by 8, so the entire numerator is divisible by 8, and denominator is 24, which is 3*8. So, the fraction is (something divisible by 8)/24 = something divisible by 8 divided by 8*3, which is something divisible by 1/3. Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe I should compute (binom{90}{4}) modulo 8 directly.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (binom{n}{k} mod 2^m) can be determined by the carries in the binary addition of k and n -k.But I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to compute each term modulo 8 step by step.Wait, let me try to compute (binom{90}{k}) modulo 8 for k=0 to 10.k=0: 1 mod 8=1k=1: 90 mod8=2k=2: (binom{90}{2}=4005). 4005 divided by 8: 4005 /8=500*8=4000, remainder 5. So, 4005 mod8=5.k=3: (binom{90}{3}=117480). 117480 /8=14685, remainder 0. So, 117480 mod8=0.k=4: (binom{90}{4}=2555190). 2555190 /8=319398*8=2555184, remainder 6. So, 2555190 mod8=6.Wait, but 2555190 divided by 8: 2555190 - 2555184=6. So, 6 mod8=6.k=5: (binom{90}{5}=43949130). 43949130 /8=5493641*8=43949128, remainder 2. So, 43949130 mod8=2.k=6: (binom{90}{6}=635745390). 635745390 /8=79468173*8=635745384, remainder 6. So, 635745390 mod8=6.k=7: (binom{90}{7}=8031810120). 8031810120 /8=1003976265*8=8031810120, remainder 0. So, 8031810120 mod8=0.k=8: (binom{90}{8}=875295600). Wait, actually, (binom{90}{8}= (binom{90}{8}). Let me compute it.Wait, (binom{90}{8}= frac{90!}{8!82!}). Hmm, that's a big number, but maybe I can compute it modulo 8.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (binom{n}{k} mod 2^m) can be determined by the binary representations.But maybe it's faster to compute (binom{90}{8}) modulo 8.Wait, 90 in binary is 1011010, as I noted earlier.k=8 is 1000 in binary.Using Lucas' theorem for prime 2, but extended to modulo 8.Wait, Lucas' theorem for prime 2 says that (binom{n}{k} equiv prod binom{n_i}{k_i} mod 2), where n_i and k_i are the bits of n and k.But for modulo 8, which is 2^3, the generalization is more complex. There's a theorem by Davis and Webb, but I don't remember the exact statement.Alternatively, maybe I can compute (binom{90}{8}) modulo 8 by considering the multiplicative inverses.Wait, but 90 is 2 mod8, and 8 is 0 mod8. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can compute (binom{90}{8}) modulo 8 by using the recursive formula for binomial coefficients.But that might take too long.Wait, another approach: since 90 ‚â° 2 mod8, and 8 is 0 mod8, perhaps (binom{90}{8}) is congruent to (binom{2}{0}) times something, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can compute (binom{90}{8}) modulo 8 using the fact that (binom{n}{k} mod 2^m) can be determined by the carries in the binary addition of k and n -k.But I'm not familiar enough with that method.Alternatively, maybe I can compute (binom{90}{8}) modulo 8 by noting that 90 ‚â° 2 mod8, and 8 ‚â°0 mod8.Wait, maybe it's easier to compute (binom{90}{8}) modulo 8 by using the multiplicative formula:(binom{90}{8} = frac{90 times 89 times 88 times 87 times 86 times 85 times 84 times 83}{8!}).Compute numerator modulo 8:90 ‚â°2, 89‚â°1, 88‚â°0, 87‚â°7, 86‚â°6, 85‚â°5, 84‚â°4, 83‚â°3.So, numerator modulo8: 2*1*0*7*6*5*4*3=0.Thus, numerator is 0 mod8, denominator is 40320, which is 0 mod8. So, 0/0 is undefined, but since the binomial coefficient is an integer, it must be that (binom{90}{8}) is divisible by 8, so (binom{90}{8} mod8=0).Wait, but let me check with actual computation.Compute (binom{90}{8}):(binom{90}{8} = frac{90 times 89 times 88 times 87 times 86 times 85 times 84 times 83}{40320}).But 88 is divisible by 8, so the numerator is divisible by 8, and the denominator is 40320, which is 8*5040. So, the fraction is (something divisible by8)/(8*5040)= something/5040.But 5040 is 720*7, which is 720*7=5040.Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I can compute (binom{90}{8}) modulo8.Wait, since the numerator is divisible by8, and the denominator is 40320, which is 8*5040, then (binom{90}{8}) is equal to (numerator/8)/5040.But numerator is divisible by8, so numerator/8 is an integer. Therefore, (binom{90}{8}) is an integer, but modulo8, it's equal to (numerator mod64)/40320 mod8.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Alternatively, since the numerator is divisible by8, and the denominator is 40320=8*5040, then (binom{90}{8}) is equal to (numerator/8)/5040.But numerator is divisible by8, so numerator/8 is an integer. Therefore, (binom{90}{8}) is an integer, but modulo8, it's equal to (numerator mod64)/40320 mod8.Wait, maybe I should compute numerator mod64.Compute numerator: 90*89*88*87*86*85*84*83.Compute each term mod64:90 mod64=2689 mod64=2588 mod64=2487 mod64=2386 mod64=2285 mod64=2184 mod64=2083 mod64=19So, numerator mod64=26*25*24*23*22*21*20*19 mod64.Compute step by step:26*25=650 mod64=650-10*64=650-640=1010*24=240 mod64=240-3*64=240-192=4848*23=1104 mod64=1104-17*64=1104-1088=1616*22=352 mod64=352-5*64=352-320=3232*21=672 mod64=672-10*64=672-640=3232*20=640 mod64=00*19=0.So, numerator mod64=0.Thus, numerator is divisible by64, so numerator/8 is divisible by8, meaning (binom{90}{8}) is divisible by8, so (binom{90}{8} mod8=0).Similarly, for k=9 and k=10, let's compute.k=9: (binom{90}{9}). Let's compute modulo8.Using the same approach, compute numerator mod64:90*89*88*87*86*85*84*83*82.But since we already saw that up to 83, the product is 0 mod64, multiplying by 82 won't change that. So, numerator mod64=0.Thus, (binom{90}{9} mod8=0).k=10: (binom{90}{10}). Similarly, numerator includes 88, which is 0 mod8, so numerator is 0 mod8, and denominator is 10! which is 3628800, which is divisible by8. So, (binom{90}{10} mod8=0).Wait, but let me check with actual computation.Compute (binom{90}{10}):(binom{90}{10} = frac{90!}{10!80!}).But 90! includes 88, which is 0 mod8, so the entire numerator is 0 mod8, and denominator is 10! which is 3628800, which is divisible by8. So, (binom{90}{10} mod8=0).Wait, but actually, (binom{90}{10}) is a specific number, but modulo8, it's 0.Wait, but let me verify with a smaller example. For example, (binom{8}{1}=8‚â°0 mod8.Similarly, (binom{9}{1}=9‚â°1 mod8.Wait, but in our case, for k=10, (binom{90}{10}) is a large number, but modulo8, it's 0 because 90 choose10 is divisible by8.Wait, but actually, 90 choose10 is 90*89*88*87*86*85*84*83*82*81 / 10!.But 88 is in the numerator, which is 0 mod8, so the entire numerator is 0 mod8, and denominator is 10!, which is divisible by8, so the result is 0 mod8.So, putting it all together, the binomial coefficients modulo8 for k=0 to10 are:k=0:1k=1:2k=2:5k=3:0k=4:6k=5:2k=6:6k=7:0k=8:0k=9:0k=10:0Now, the expression S is:1 - (binom{90}{1}) + (binom{90}{2}) - (binom{90}{3}) + (binom{90}{4}) - (binom{90}{5}) + (binom{90}{6}) - (binom{90}{7}) + (binom{90}{8}) - (binom{90}{9}) + (binom{90}{10}).But modulo8, each term is:1 -2 +5 -0 +6 -2 +6 -0 +0 -0 +0.Compute step by step:Start with 1.1 -2 = -1 ‚â°7 mod8.7 +5=12‚â°4 mod8.4 -0=4.4 +6=10‚â°2 mod8.2 -2=0.0 +6=6.6 -0=6.6 +0=6.6 -0=6.6 +0=6.So, S mod8=6.Wait, that's interesting. So, the partial sum modulo8 is6.Now, let's compute the partial sum modulo11.Computing modulo11:Again, the expression S=1 - (binom{90}{1}) + (binom{90}{2}) - (binom{90}{3}) + ... + (-1)^10 (binom{90}{10}).We need to compute each (binom{90}{k}) modulo11, then multiply by (-1)^k, and sum them up.First, note that 90 mod11=90 -8*11=90-88=2. So, 90‚â°2 mod11.So, we can use Lucas' theorem for prime11.Lucas' theorem: For prime p, and n and k expressed in base p as n=n_m n_{m-1}...n_0 and k=k_m k_{m-1}...k_0, then (binom{n}{k} equiv prod binom{n_i}{k_i} mod p).Since 11 is prime, we can apply Lucas' theorem.First, express 90 in base11.90 divided by11 is8 with remainder2, so 90=8*11 +2. So, in base11, 90 is written as82.Similarly, k from0 to10 in base11:k=0:00k=1:01k=2:02k=3:03k=4:04k=5:05k=6:06k=7:07k=8:08k=9:09k=10:10Now, for each k, express k in base11, and then compute (binom{8}{k_1} binom{2}{k_0} mod11), where k=k_1*11 +k_0.Wait, but for k up to10, k_1=0 and k_0=k.So, for k=0 to10, (binom{90}{k} mod11= binom{8}{0}binom{2}{k} mod11=1*binom{2}{k} mod11).But wait, that's only if k<11, which it is. So, for k=0 to10, (binom{90}{k} mod11= binom{2}{k} mod11).But (binom{2}{k}) is 0 when k>2.So, for k=0: (binom{2}{0}=1)k=1: (binom{2}{1}=2)k=2: (binom{2}{2}=1)k=3 to10: (binom{2}{k}=0)Thus, modulo11, the binomial coefficients are:k=0:1k=1:2k=2:1k=3:0k=4:0k=5:0k=6:0k=7:0k=8:0k=9:0k=10:0Now, the expression S modulo11 is:1 -2 +1 -0 +0 -0 +0 -0 +0 -0 +0.Compute step by step:1 -2= -1‚â°10 mod11.10 +1=11‚â°0 mod11.0 -0=0.0 +0=0.0 -0=0.0 +0=0.0 -0=0.0 +0=0.0 -0=0.0 +0=0.So, S mod11=0.Wait, that's interesting. So, the partial sum modulo11 is0.Now, we have S‚â°6 mod8 and S‚â°0 mod11.We need to find S mod88, since 88=8*11 and 8 and11 are coprime.Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we need to find a number x such that:x ‚â°6 mod8x ‚â°0 mod11So, x=11k for some integer k, and 11k‚â°6 mod8.Compute 11 mod8=3, so 3k‚â°6 mod8.Multiply both sides by the inverse of3 mod8. The inverse of3 mod8 is3, because3*3=9‚â°1 mod8.So, k‚â°6*3=18‚â°2 mod8.Thus, k=8m +2 for some integer m.Thus, x=11k=11*(8m +2)=88m +22.Thus, the smallest positive solution is x=22 mod88.Therefore, the remainder when S is divided by88 is22.Wait, but let me double-check.Wait, I have S‚â°6 mod8 and S‚â°0 mod11.So, S=11k, and 11k‚â°6 mod8.11‚â°3 mod8, so 3k‚â°6 mod8.Multiply both sides by3 inverse, which is3, since3*3=9‚â°1 mod8.Thus, k‚â°6*3=18‚â°2 mod8.So, k=8m +2.Thus, S=11*(8m +2)=88m +22.Thus, S‚â°22 mod88.So, the remainder is22.Wait, but earlier, when I computed modulo8, I got6, and modulo11, I got0, leading to22 mod88.But wait, let me check my computation of S mod11 again.I said that for k=0 to10, (binom{90}{k} mod11= binom{2}{k}). But is that correct?Wait, Lucas' theorem says that (binom{n}{k} mod p= prod binom{n_i}{k_i}), where n_i and k_i are the digits of n and k in base p.So, for n=90=8*11 +2, so in base11, it's82.For k=0 to10, which are less than11, so in base11, they are00,01,...,10.Thus, (binom{90}{k} mod11= binom{8}{0} binom{2}{k} mod11=1*binom{2}{k} mod11).But (binom{2}{k}) is1 for k=0,2; 2 for k=1; and0 otherwise.Thus, for k=0:1k=1:2k=2:1k=3 to10:0So, S=1 -2 +1 -0 +0 -0 +0 -0 +0 -0 +0= (1 -2 +1)=0.Wait, that's correct. So, S mod11=0.Thus, S‚â°6 mod8 and S‚â°0 mod11, leading to S‚â°22 mod88.Wait, but earlier, when I computed the partial sum modulo8, I got6, and modulo11, I got0, so the combined result is22 mod88.But wait, let me check if that makes sense.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing S mod8.Let me recompute S mod8:The binomial coefficients modulo8 for k=0 to10 are:k=0:1k=1:2k=2:5k=3:0k=4:6k=5:2k=6:6k=7:0k=8:0k=9:0k=10:0So, the expression S=1 -2 +5 -0 +6 -2 +6 -0 +0 -0 +0.Compute step by step:Start with1.1 -2= -1‚â°7 mod8.7 +5=12‚â°4 mod8.4 -0=4.4 +6=10‚â°2 mod8.2 -2=0.0 +6=6.6 -0=6.6 +0=6.6 -0=6.6 +0=6.So, S mod8=6.Yes, that's correct.Thus, the remainder is22.Wait, but the initial problem was to compute the remainder when the expression is divided by88, which is22.But wait, let me think again.Wait, the original expression is the partial sum up to k=10 of (-1)^k (binom{90}{k}).But I just realized that the original expression is up to k=10, but the full expansion of (1-1)^90 is0, which is the sum fromk=0 tok=90.Thus, the partial sum up tok=10 is equal to the full sum minus the sum fromk=11 tok=90.But the full sum is0, so the partial sum is equal to -sum fromk=11 tok=90 of (-1)^k (binom{90}{k}).But I don't know if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can think of the partial sum as the expansion of (1 -1)^10, but with coefficients from90.Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, another approach: the partial sum S= sum_{k=0}^{10} (-1)^k (binom{90}{k}).We can relate this to the binomial expansion of (1 -1)^90, but truncated at k=10.But since (1 -1)^90=0, which is the sum fromk=0 tok=90 of (-1)^k (binom{90}{k}).Thus, S=0 - sum_{k=11}^{90} (-1)^k (binom{90}{k}).But I don't know if that helps with modulo88.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that S is the sum up tok=10, and since 88=8*11, and we've computed S mod8=6 and S mod11=0, leading to S‚â°22 mod88.Thus, the remainder is22.Wait, but in the initial problem, the assistant's answer was1, but that was incorrect because they considered the full expansion up to k=10, but in reality, the partial sum is different.Wait, no, the assistant's answer was1, but that was based on a different approach, considering the expansion of (1 -90)^10, which is incorrect because the original expression is up tok=10, not up tok=90.Wait, let me see the assistant's thought process.The assistant wrote:\\"The original expression can be rewritten as (1-90)^10=(88+1)^10=88^{10}+binom(10}{1}88^9+‚Ä¶+binom(10}{9}88+1.Since the first 10 terms are divisible by88, the remainder is1.\\"But that's incorrect because the original expression is up tok=10, not up tok=90. So, the assistant incorrectly assumed that the original expression is the full expansion up tok=10, which is not the case.Wait, no, actually, the original expression is up tok=10, but the assistant tried to relate it to (1 -90)^10, which is a different expression.Wait, (1 -90)^10 is indeed the sum fromk=0 tok=10 of (-1)^k (binom{10}{k})90^{10 -k}.But the original expression is sum fromk=0 tok=10 of (-1)^k (binom{90}{k}).These are different because the binomial coefficients are different.Thus, the assistant's approach was incorrect.Therefore, the correct approach is to compute the partial sum modulo88 by computing modulo8 and modulo11 separately, then combining via Chinese Remainder Theorem, leading to the remainder22.Thus, the remainder is22.But wait, let me double-check the computation of S mod8.Earlier, I computed S mod8=6, but let me verify that.The binomial coefficients modulo8 for k=0 to10 are:k=0:1k=1:2k=2:5k=3:0k=4:6k=5:2k=6:6k=7:0k=8:0k=9:0k=10:0So, S=1 -2 +5 -0 +6 -2 +6 -0 +0 -0 +0.Compute step by step:1 -2= -1‚â°7 mod8.7 +5=12‚â°4 mod8.4 -0=4.4 +6=10‚â°2 mod8.2 -2=0.0 +6=6.6 -0=6.6 +0=6.6 -0=6.6 +0=6.Yes, S mod8=6.Similarly, S mod11=0.Thus, the remainder is22.Therefore, the final answer is22."},{"question":"A horse is tethered to one corner of a rectangular grassy field 40 m by 24 m with a certain length of rope.

How long is the rope?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a horse is tied to a corner of a rectangular field that's 40 meters by 24 meters. The horse can graze over an area of about 153.94 square meters, and I need to figure out how long the rope is. Hmm, let's see.First, I know that when an animal is tied to a point, like a corner, it can graze in a circular area around that point. But since the field is rectangular, the horse can't graze the entire circle; it's limited by the sides of the rectangle. So, the area the horse can graze is actually a quarter of a circle, right? Because the horse is tied to a corner, and the field blocks the other three-quarters of the circle.Okay, so if the area the horse can graze is a quarter of a circle, then the area should be (1/4) * œÄ * r¬≤, where r is the length of the rope. The problem gives me the area as approximately 153.94 square meters. So, I can set up the equation:(1/4) * œÄ * r¬≤ = 153.94Now, I need to solve for r. Let's rearrange the equation:r¬≤ = (153.94 * 4) / œÄCalculating that, 153.94 times 4 is 615.76. Then, dividing by œÄ (approximately 3.1416), I get:r¬≤ = 615.76 / 3.1416 ‚âà 196So, r is the square root of 196, which is 14. Therefore, the rope is 14 meters long.Wait a second, but the field is 40 meters by 24 meters. If the rope is 14 meters, does that mean the horse can graze without being restricted by the field's other sides? Let me think. If the rope is 14 meters, and the field is 40 meters long and 24 meters wide, then 14 meters is less than both 24 and 40, so the horse can graze a full quarter-circle without being restricted further. That makes sense.But just to double-check, if the rope were longer than 24 meters, the horse could graze a larger area, but in this case, since 14 is less than both dimensions, the area is just a simple quarter-circle. So, I think my calculation is correct.Yeah, I'm pretty confident now that the rope is 14 meters long."},{"question":"Given the sequence {a_n} with the general term formula a_n = (2n-1) cdot 2^n, we want to use the method of staggered subtraction to find the sum of the first n terms, S_n. From S_n = 1 cdot 2 + 3 cdot 2^2 + 5 cdot 2^3 + ldots + (2n-1) cdot 2^n, we get 2S_n = 1 cdot 2^2 + 3 cdot 2^3 + 5 cdot 2^4 + ldots + (2n-1) cdot 2^{n+1}. By subtracting term-by-term, we arrive at: -S_n = 2 + 2 cdot 2^2 + 2 cdot 2^3 + ldots + 2 cdot 2^n - (2n-1) cdot 2^{n+1}, and we find that S_n = (2n-3) cdot 2^{n+1} + 6. By analogy, if the sequence {b_n} has the general term formula b_n = n^2 cdot 2^n, what is the sum of the first n terms, T_n?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the first n terms of a sequence where each term is given by b_n = n¬≤ * 2‚Åø. The problem mentions using the method of staggered subtraction, which I remember is similar to the technique used in the previous example with the sequence a_n = (2n - 1) * 2‚Åø. Let me try to recall how that worked.In the previous example, they started with S_n = 1*2 + 3*2¬≤ + 5*2¬≥ + ... + (2n - 1)*2‚Åø. Then they multiplied both sides by 2 to get 2S_n, which shifted all the terms by one power of 2. After that, they subtracted the original S_n from this 2S_n, which resulted in a telescoping series where most terms canceled out, leaving them with a simpler expression to solve for S_n.So, for the current problem, I need to do something similar but with b_n = n¬≤ * 2‚Åø. Let me denote the sum of the first n terms as T_n. Therefore, T_n = 1¬≤*2 + 2¬≤*2¬≤ + 3¬≤*2¬≥ + ... + n¬≤*2‚Åø.Following the method, I should compute 2T_n. Let's write that out:2T_n = 1¬≤*2¬≤ + 2¬≤*2¬≥ + 3¬≤*2‚Å¥ + ... + n¬≤*2^{n+1}.Now, if I subtract T_n from 2T_n, I get:2T_n - T_n = T_n = (1¬≤*2¬≤ + 2¬≤*2¬≥ + 3¬≤*2‚Å¥ + ... + n¬≤*2^{n+1}) - (1¬≤*2 + 2¬≤*2¬≤ + 3¬≤*2¬≥ + ... + n¬≤*2‚Åø).Let me write this out term by term to see what cancels:- The first term of 2T_n is 1¬≤*2¬≤, and the first term of T_n is 1¬≤*2. So, subtracting, we get 1¬≤*(2¬≤ - 2) = 1*(4 - 2) = 2.- The second term of 2T_n is 2¬≤*2¬≥, and the second term of T_n is 2¬≤*2¬≤. Subtracting, we get 2¬≤*(2¬≥ - 2¬≤) = 4*(8 - 4) = 16.- The third term of 2T_n is 3¬≤*2‚Å¥, and the third term of T_n is 3¬≤*2¬≥. Subtracting, we get 3¬≤*(2‚Å¥ - 2¬≥) = 9*(16 - 8) = 72.- Continuing this pattern, each term k¬≤*(2^{k+1} - 2^k) = k¬≤*2^k*(2 - 1) = k¬≤*2^k.Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. If I have k¬≤*2^{k+1} - k¬≤*2^k, that's k¬≤*2^k*(2 - 1) = k¬≤*2^k. So, each term in the subtraction is k¬≤*2^k.But wait, in the subtraction, the first term is 1¬≤*(2¬≤ - 2) = 2, the second term is 2¬≤*(2¬≥ - 2¬≤) = 16, the third term is 3¬≤*(2‚Å¥ - 2¬≥) = 72, and so on, up to the nth term, which would be n¬≤*(2^{n+1} - 2^n) = n¬≤*2^n.But when I subtract T_n from 2T_n, I also have to consider the last term. The last term of 2T_n is n¬≤*2^{n+1}, and there's no corresponding term in T_n beyond n¬≤*2^n. So, actually, the subtraction would leave us with:T_n = (1¬≤*2¬≤ + 2¬≤*2¬≥ + ... + n¬≤*2^{n+1}) - (1¬≤*2 + 2¬≤*2¬≤ + ... + n¬≤*2^n)Which simplifies to:T_n = (1¬≤*(2¬≤ - 2) + 2¬≤*(2¬≥ - 2¬≤) + 3¬≤*(2‚Å¥ - 2¬≥) + ... + n¬≤*(2^{n+1} - 2^n)).But as I saw earlier, each term k¬≤*(2^{k+1} - 2^k) = k¬≤*2^k*(2 - 1) = k¬≤*2^k. So, T_n = sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^k.Wait, that's just the original T_n. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the subtraction.Let me try a different approach. Let's write out the subtraction more carefully.We have:2T_n = 1¬≤*2¬≤ + 2¬≤*2¬≥ + 3¬≤*2‚Å¥ + ... + n¬≤*2^{n+1}T_n = 1¬≤*2 + 2¬≤*2¬≤ + 3¬≤*2¬≥ + ... + n¬≤*2^nSubtracting T_n from 2T_n:2T_n - T_n = T_n = (1¬≤*2¬≤ - 1¬≤*2) + (2¬≤*2¬≥ - 2¬≤*2¬≤) + (3¬≤*2‚Å¥ - 3¬≤*2¬≥) + ... + (n¬≤*2^{n+1} - n¬≤*2^n)So, each term is k¬≤*(2^{k+1} - 2^k) = k¬≤*2^k*(2 - 1) = k¬≤*2^k.Therefore, T_n = sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^k.But that's the same as the original T_n, which doesn't help. So, I must have made a mistake in the setup.Wait, no, actually, when I subtract, the terms from k=1 to k=n are k¬≤*2^k, but the last term in 2T_n is n¬≤*2^{n+1}, which doesn't have a corresponding term in T_n. So, actually, the subtraction should be:T_n = (sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^{k+1}) - (sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^k) - n¬≤*2^{n+1}Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.When I subtract T_n from 2T_n, I get:2T_n - T_n = T_n = (sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^{k+1}) - (sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^k)But the first sum is sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^{k+1} = sum_{k=2}^{n+1} (k-1)¬≤*2^kSo, T_n = sum_{k=2}^{n+1} (k-1)¬≤*2^k - sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^kNow, let's write this out:T_n = [sum_{k=2}^{n} (k-1)¬≤*2^k + (n)¬≤*2^{n+1}] - [sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^k]So, T_n = sum_{k=2}^{n} (k-1)¬≤*2^k + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - sum_{k=1}^n k¬≤*2^kNow, let's split the sums:T_n = [sum_{k=2}^{n} (k-1)¬≤*2^k - sum_{k=2}^{n} k¬≤*2^k] + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 1¬≤*2^1Because the second sum starts at k=1, so when we subtract, the k=1 term is -1¬≤*2^1, and the rest from k=2 to n cancel out in a way.So, T_n = sum_{k=2}^{n} [(k-1)¬≤ - k¬≤]*2^k + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 2Simplify the expression inside the sum:(k-1)¬≤ - k¬≤ = (k¬≤ - 2k + 1) - k¬≤ = -2k + 1So, T_n = sum_{k=2}^{n} (-2k + 1)*2^k + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 2Now, let's write this as:T_n = -2*sum_{k=2}^{n} k*2^k + sum_{k=2}^{n} 2^k + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 2Now, I need to compute these two sums: sum_{k=2}^{n} k*2^k and sum_{k=2}^{n} 2^k.I know that sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^k = 2^{n+1} - 1, so sum_{k=2}^{n} 2^k = (2^{n+1} - 1) - 2^0 - 2^1 = 2^{n+1} - 1 - 1 - 2 = 2^{n+1} - 4.Similarly, for sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^k, I recall that it's equal to 2*(n*2^{n+1} - 2^{n+1} + 2). Let me verify that.Wait, let me derive it. Let S = sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^k.Then, 2S = sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^{k+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n+1} (k-1)*2^k.Subtracting, 2S - S = S = sum_{k=1}^{n+1} (k-1)*2^k - sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^k= sum_{k=1}^{n+1} (k-1)*2^k - sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^k= sum_{k=1}^{n} (k-1)*2^k + n*2^{n+1} - sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^k= sum_{k=1}^{n} (k-1 - k)*2^k + n*2^{n+1} - 0= sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)*2^k + n*2^{n+1}= - (2^{n+1} - 2) + n*2^{n+1}= (n - 1)*2^{n+1} + 2So, S = sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^k = (n - 1)*2^{n+1} + 2.Therefore, sum_{k=2}^{n} k*2^k = S - 0*2^0 - 1*2^1 = (n - 1)*2^{n+1} + 2 - 0 - 2 = (n - 1)*2^{n+1}.Wait, let me check that again.sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^k = (n - 1)*2^{n+1} + 2.Therefore, sum_{k=2}^{n} k*2^k = sum_{k=0}^{n} k*2^k - 0*2^0 - 1*2^1 = (n - 1)*2^{n+1} + 2 - 0 - 2 = (n - 1)*2^{n+1}.Yes, that seems correct.So, sum_{k=2}^{n} k*2^k = (n - 1)*2^{n+1}.Now, going back to T_n:T_n = -2*sum_{k=2}^{n} k*2^k + sum_{k=2}^{n} 2^k + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 2= -2*(n - 1)*2^{n+1} + (2^{n+1} - 4) + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 2Simplify each term:-2*(n - 1)*2^{n+1} = -2n*2^{n+1} + 2*2^{n+1} = -n*2^{n+2} + 2^{n+2}Wait, no, let's compute it correctly:-2*(n - 1)*2^{n+1} = -2n*2^{n+1} + 2*2^{n+1} = -n*2^{n+2} + 2^{n+2}Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's compute it step by step.First, -2*(n - 1)*2^{n+1} = -2*(n - 1)*2^{n+1} = - (2n - 2)*2^{n+1} = -2n*2^{n+1} + 2*2^{n+1} = -n*2^{n+2} + 2^{n+2}.Wait, no, 2n*2^{n+1} is n*2^{n+2}, and 2*2^{n+1} is 2^{n+2}.So, yes, that's correct.Now, the second term is sum_{k=2}^{n} 2^k = 2^{n+1} - 4.So, putting it all together:T_n = (-n*2^{n+2} + 2^{n+2}) + (2^{n+1} - 4) + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 2Now, let's combine like terms.First, let's collect all the terms with 2^{n+2}:- n*2^{n+2} + 2^{n+2} = ( -n + 1 ) * 2^{n+2}Next, the term with 2^{n+1}:2^{n+1}Then, the constants:-4 - 2 = -6And the term with n¬≤*2^{n+1}:n¬≤*2^{n+1}So, combining all these:T_n = ( -n + 1 ) * 2^{n+2} + 2^{n+1} + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 6Now, let's factor out 2^{n+1} where possible.First, note that 2^{n+2} = 2*2^{n+1}, so:( -n + 1 ) * 2^{n+2} = ( -n + 1 ) * 2 * 2^{n+1} = ( -2n + 2 ) * 2^{n+1}So, T_n = ( -2n + 2 ) * 2^{n+1} + 2^{n+1} + n¬≤*2^{n+1} - 6Now, combine the terms with 2^{n+1}:( -2n + 2 + 1 + n¬≤ ) * 2^{n+1} - 6Simplify inside the parentheses:n¬≤ - 2n + 3So, T_n = (n¬≤ - 2n + 3) * 2^{n+1} - 6Therefore, the sum of the first n terms T_n is:T_n = (n¬≤ - 2n + 3) * 2^{n+1} - 6I think that's the final answer. Let me just check if the dimensions make sense. The original terms are n¬≤*2‚Åø, so the sum should be something like n¬≤*2^{n+1} minus some lower terms, which it is. The constants also seem to check out. I think this is correct."},{"question":"A round pizza is frac{1}{2} of an inch thick and has a diameter of 16 inches. It is cut into 8 equal pieces.

The capacitor has a capacitance C. Then, it's put in a microwave, and the side length of each plate increases by 1%. I need to figure out by what percent the voltage between the two plates changes. The options are that the voltage decreases by 2%, decreases by 1%, doesn't change, increases by 1%, or increases by 2%. First, I remember that the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by the formula C = Œµ‚ÇÄ * A / d, where Œµ‚ÇÄ is the permittivity of free space, A is the area of the plates, and d is the separation between the plates. Since the plates are square, the area A is L squared, so A = L¬≤.Now, the side length increases by 1%, so the new side length L' is L multiplied by 1.01. Therefore, the new area A' would be (L * 1.01) squared, which is L¬≤ * (1.01)¬≤. Calculating (1.01)¬≤ gives approximately 1.0201, so the new area A' is about 1.0201 times the original area A.Since capacitance is proportional to the area, the new capacitance C' will be C multiplied by 1.0201. So, C' = C * 1.0201.Now, voltage across a capacitor is given by V = Q / C, where Q is the charge on the capacitor. Assuming the charge Q remains constant, which it would if the capacitor is disconnected from any circuit, the new voltage V' will be Q divided by the new capacitance C'. So, V' = Q / C' = Q / (C * 1.0201) = (Q / C) / 1.0201 = V / 1.0201.To find the percentage change in voltage, I can calculate (V' - V) / V * 100%. Plugging in V' = V / 1.0201, we get:(V / 1.0201 - V) / V * 100% = (1 / 1.0201 - 1) * 100%.Calculating 1 / 1.0201 gives approximately 0.9802. So, (0.9802 - 1) * 100% = -0.0198 * 100% = -1.98%.This means the voltage decreases by approximately 2%. Looking at the options, the closest one is that the voltage decreases by 2%. So, the answer should be option A: decreases by 2%.Wait, let me double-check. If the area increases by about 2%, then the capacitance increases by about 2%, right? Since C is proportional to A. So, if C increases by 2%, and voltage is inversely proportional to C, then voltage should decrease by approximately 2%. Yeah, that makes sense.I think I got it right. The voltage decreases by about 2% when the side length of the plates increases by 1%."},{"question":"Are vectors a, b, and c coplanar?a={6, 3, 4}b={-1, -2, -1}c={2, 1, 2}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if three vectors a, b, and c are coplanar. The vectors are given as:a = {6, 3, 4}b = {-1, -2, -1}c = {2, 1, 2}Hmm, I remember that vectors are coplanar if they lie in the same plane. But how do I check that mathematically? I think it has something to do with the scalar triple product. Let me recall... Oh yeah, if the scalar triple product of the three vectors is zero, then they are coplanar. If it's not zero, they aren't coplanar.So, the scalar triple product is calculated as the determinant of a matrix formed by these vectors. That is, if I arrange the vectors as rows (or columns) in a 3x3 matrix and compute its determinant, the result will tell me if they're coplanar.Alright, let me set up the matrix. I'll place each vector as a row:| 6   3   4 ||-1  -2  -1 ||2    1   2 |Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. I think the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)Where the matrix is:| a   b   c || d   e   f || g   h   i |So, applying this to our matrix:a = 6, b = 3, c = 4d = -1, e = -2, f = -1g = 2, h = 1, i = 2Plugging into the formula:det = 6[(-2)(2) - (-1)(1)] - 3[(-1)(2) - (-1)(2)] + 4[(-1)(1) - (-2)(2)]Let me compute each part step by step.First part: 6[(-2)(2) - (-1)(1)] = 6[(-4) - (-1)] = 6[-4 + 1] = 6[-3] = -18Second part: -3[(-1)(2) - (-1)(2)] = -3[(-2) - (-2)] = -3[-2 + 2] = -3[0] = 0Third part: 4[(-1)(1) - (-2)(2)] = 4[(-1) - (-4)] = 4[-1 + 4] = 4[3] = 12Now, adding them all together: -18 + 0 + 12 = -6So, the determinant is -6. Since this is not zero, the scalar triple product is not zero, which means the vectors are not coplanar.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First part: 6 times [(-2)(2) - (-1)(1)] = 6[-4 +1] = 6*(-3) = -18. That seems right.Second part: -3 times [(-1)(2) - (-1)(2)] = -3[-2 +2] = -3[0] = 0. That also looks correct.Third part: 4 times [(-1)(1) - (-2)(2)] = 4[-1 +4] = 4*3 = 12. Yep, that's correct.Adding them: -18 + 0 +12 = -6. Yep, that's correct.So, the determinant is indeed -6, which is not zero. Therefore, the vectors are not coplanar.I think that's it. So, the answer is that the vectors are not coplanar because their scalar triple product is -6, which is not zero."},{"question":"Find the angle of inclination of the tangent to the function f(x) = frac{1}{x} + 2x at x = 1.A: frac{pi}{4}B: frac{pi}{6}C: frac{pi}{3}D: frac{2pi}{3}","answer":"Alright, so I need to find the angle of inclination of the tangent to the function f(x) = 1/x + 2x at x = 1. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the angle of inclination of a tangent line to a curve at a particular point is the angle that the tangent makes with the positive direction of the x-axis. This angle is usually measured in radians and is between 0 and œÄ. To find this angle, I need to determine the slope of the tangent line at that point because the slope is equal to the tangent of the angle of inclination.So, to find the slope of the tangent line, I need to compute the derivative of the function f(x) at x = 1. The derivative f'(x) will give me the slope of the tangent at any point x.Let me recall how to find the derivative of f(x) = 1/x + 2x. I think I can differentiate each term separately.Starting with the first term, 1/x. I remember that the derivative of 1/x is -1/x¬≤. Let me confirm that: yes, using the power rule, d/dx [x^n] = n x^(n-1). So, for 1/x, which is x^(-1), the derivative is -1 x^(-2) = -1/x¬≤.Now, the second term is 2x. The derivative of 2x with respect to x is straightforward. The derivative of x is 1, so multiplying by 2 gives 2.Putting it all together, the derivative f'(x) is -1/x¬≤ + 2.Okay, so f'(x) = -1/x¬≤ + 2. Now, I need to evaluate this derivative at x = 1 to find the slope of the tangent at that specific point.Substituting x = 1 into f'(x):f'(1) = -1/(1)¬≤ + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1.So, the slope of the tangent line at x = 1 is 1.Now, since the slope m is equal to tan(Œ±), where Œ± is the angle of inclination, I can write:tan(Œ±) = 1.I need to find the angle Œ± such that its tangent is 1. I remember that tan(œÄ/4) = 1 because tan(45 degrees) = 1. So, Œ± = œÄ/4.Wait, let me double-check that. Yes, tan(œÄ/4) is indeed 1. So, the angle of inclination is œÄ/4 radians.Looking back at the options provided:A: œÄ/4B: œÄ/6C: œÄ/3D: 2œÄ/3So, the correct answer should be option A: œÄ/4.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:1. Found the derivative of f(x) = 1/x + 2x, which is f'(x) = -1/x¬≤ + 2.2. Evaluated f'(1) = -1 + 2 = 1.3. Since tan(Œ±) = 1, Œ± = œÄ/4.Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. The derivative was straightforward, and evaluating it at x = 1 gave a clear result. The angle corresponding to a slope of 1 is definitely œÄ/4.I guess another way to think about it is that a slope of 1 means the tangent line rises at a 45-degree angle from the x-axis, which is œÄ/4 radians. That makes sense.So, I'm confident that the angle of inclination is œÄ/4, which is option A."},{"question":"Given: (sin^2 1^circ + sin^2 61^circ + sin^2 121^circ = frac{3}{2}) and (sin^2 5^circ + sin^2 65^circ + sin^2 125^circ = frac{3}{2})Based on the pattern observed in the two equations above, please write a general proposition: _______________________________________________________________________","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given two equations involving the sum of squares of sine functions at specific angles, and both sums equal 3/2. The first equation is sin¬≤(1¬∞) + sin¬≤(61¬∞) + sin¬≤(121¬∞) = 3/2, and the second one is sin¬≤(5¬∞) + sin¬≤(65¬∞) + sin¬≤(125¬∞) = 3/2. I need to figure out a general proposition based on the pattern observed in these two equations.First, I should look at the angles in each equation to see if there's a common pattern or relationship between them. In the first equation, the angles are 1¬∞, 61¬∞, and 121¬∞. Let me see how these angles are related. If I subtract 1¬∞ from 61¬∞, I get 60¬∞, and if I subtract 61¬∞ from 121¬∞, I also get 60¬∞. So, it seems like these angles form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 60¬∞. Similarly, in the second equation, the angles are 5¬∞, 65¬∞, and 125¬∞. Subtracting 5¬∞ from 65¬∞ gives 60¬∞, and subtracting 65¬∞ from 125¬∞ also gives 60¬∞. So, these angles also form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 60¬∞.So, both equations involve three angles that are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 60¬∞, and the sum of their sine squares equals 3/2. This suggests that there might be a general formula where if you take three angles that are 60¬∞ apart from each other, the sum of their sine squares will always equal 3/2.To test this hypothesis, I can try another set of angles that fit this pattern. Let's say I choose 10¬∞, 70¬∞, and 130¬∞. According to the pattern, sin¬≤(10¬∞) + sin¬≤(70¬∞) + sin¬≤(130¬∞) should equal 3/2. Let me calculate each term:First, sin(10¬∞) is approximately 0.1736, so sin¬≤(10¬∞) is about 0.0301.Next, sin(70¬∞) is approximately 0.9397, so sin¬≤(70¬∞) is about 0.8830.Then, sin(130¬∞) is the same as sin(180¬∞ - 50¬∞) which is sin(50¬∞), approximately 0.7660, so sin¬≤(130¬∞) is about 0.5868.Adding these up: 0.0301 + 0.8830 + 0.5868 ‚âà 1.4999, which is approximately 1.5, or 3/2. So, this seems to confirm the pattern.Another way to think about this is using trigonometric identities. The sum of squares of sine functions can be related to cosine functions using the identity sin¬≤(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2. So, if I apply this identity to each term in the sum, I can rewrite the sum as:sin¬≤(Œ±) + sin¬≤(Œ± + 60¬∞) + sin¬≤(Œ± + 120¬∞) = [ (1 - cos(2Œ±))/2 ] + [ (1 - cos(2Œ± + 120¬∞))/2 ] + [ (1 - cos(2Œ± + 240¬∞))/2 ]Simplifying this, I get:= 3/2 - [ cos(2Œ±) + cos(2Œ± + 120¬∞) + cos(2Œ± + 240¬∞) ] / 2Now, I need to evaluate the sum of the cosines. Let's denote Œ∏ = 2Œ±. Then, the sum becomes:cos(Œ∏) + cos(Œ∏ + 120¬∞) + cos(Œ∏ + 240¬∞)I recall that the sum of cosines with angles equally spaced around a circle (in this case, 120¬∞ apart) is zero. This is because the vectors represented by these cosines cancel each other out when added together. Therefore, the sum of cos(Œ∏) + cos(Œ∏ + 120¬∞) + cos(Œ∏ + 240¬∞) equals zero.So, substituting back, the expression simplifies to:3/2 - [0]/2 = 3/2This confirms that the sum of the squares of the sine functions at angles Œ±, Œ± + 60¬∞, and Œ± + 120¬∞ is indeed 3/2, regardless of the value of Œ±.Therefore, the general proposition is that for any angle Œ±, the sum of the squares of the sine of Œ±, Œ± + 60¬∞, and Œ± + 120¬∞ is equal to 3/2."},{"question":"The equation of the tangent line to the curve y = e^{2x} at the point (0,1) is __________.","answer":"First, I need to find the derivative of the function ( y = e^{2x} ) to determine the slope of the tangent line at the point ( (0, 1) ).Taking the derivative, I get:[frac{dy}{dx} = 2e^{2x}]Next, I'll evaluate the derivative at ( x = 0 ) to find the slope at that specific point:[frac{dy}{dx}Big|_{x=0} = 2e^{0} = 2]Now that I have the slope ( m = 2 ) and the point ( (0, 1) ), I can use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of the tangent line:[y - 1 = 2(x - 0)]Simplifying this, the equation of the tangent line is:[y = 2x + 1]"},{"question":"Given that point P is a moving point on the curve y= frac {3-e^{x}}{e^{x}+1}, and alpha is the slant angle of the tangent line at point P, what is the minimum value of alpha?A: 0B: frac {pi}{4}C: frac {2pi}{3}D: frac {3pi}{4}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of the slant angle Œ± of the tangent line at a moving point P on the curve y = (3 - e^x)/(e^x + 1). The options given are A: 0, B: œÄ/4, C: 2œÄ/3, D: 3œÄ/4. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.First, I remember that the slant angle Œ± of a tangent line is related to the slope of the tangent. Specifically, the slope m is equal to tan(Œ±). So, if I can find the slope of the tangent line at any point P on the curve, I can then find Œ± by taking the arctangent of that slope.To find the slope of the tangent line, I need to compute the derivative of the function y with respect to x. The function is y = (3 - e^x)/(e^x + 1). This looks like a quotient, so I should use the quotient rule for differentiation. The quotient rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x)/h(x), then the derivative f‚Äô(x) = (g‚Äô(x)h(x) - g(x)h‚Äô(x))/[h(x)]¬≤.Let me assign g(x) = 3 - e^x and h(x) = e^x + 1. Then, g‚Äô(x) would be the derivative of 3 minus the derivative of e^x, which is 0 - e^x = -e^x. Similarly, h‚Äô(x) is the derivative of e^x plus the derivative of 1, which is e^x + 0 = e^x.Now, applying the quotient rule:y‚Äô = [g‚Äô(x)h(x) - g(x)h‚Äô(x)] / [h(x)]¬≤= [(-e^x)(e^x + 1) - (3 - e^x)(e^x)] / (e^x + 1)^2Let me expand the numerator step by step. First, multiply -e^x by (e^x + 1):- e^x * e^x = -e^{2x}- e^x * 1 = -e^xSo, the first part is -e^{2x} - e^x.Next, multiply (3 - e^x) by e^x:3 * e^x = 3e^x- e^x * e^x = -e^{2x}So, the second part is 3e^x - e^{2x}.Now, subtracting the second part from the first part:(-e^{2x} - e^x) - (3e^x - e^{2x}) = -e^{2x} - e^x - 3e^x + e^{2x}Let me combine like terms:- e^{2x} + e^{2x} cancels out to 0.- e^x - 3e^x = -4e^xSo, the numerator simplifies to -4e^x. Therefore, the derivative y‚Äô is:y‚Äô = (-4e^x) / (e^x + 1)^2Hmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check my steps. I applied the quotient rule correctly, expanded each term, and combined like terms. Yes, that seems right.Now, the slope of the tangent line at any point x is y‚Äô = -4e^x / (e^x + 1)^2. Since the slope is negative (because of the negative sign in front), the angle Œ± must be between œÄ/2 and œÄ, right? Because the tangent of angles in that range is negative.But the question asks for the minimum value of Œ±. So, I need to find the smallest angle Œ± in that range such that tan(Œ±) equals the slope. Wait, but since the slope is negative, and the angle is measured from the positive x-axis, the angle Œ± is actually in the second quadrant, between œÄ/2 and œÄ. The minimum value of Œ± would correspond to the least steep slope, which is the slope closest to zero.Wait, but hold on. The problem is asking for the minimum value of Œ±, which is the angle. Since angles in the second quadrant increase from œÄ/2 to œÄ, the minimum angle would be the one closest to œÄ/2, which corresponds to the steepest negative slope. Hmm, I need to clarify this.Wait, actually, the angle Œ± is measured from the positive x-axis to the tangent line in the counterclockwise direction. So, for a negative slope, the angle is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. The steeper the negative slope, the closer the angle is to œÄ/2. The less steep the negative slope, the closer the angle is to œÄ.Wait, so if the slope is more negative (i.e., a larger magnitude negative number), the angle is closer to œÄ/2. If the slope is less negative (closer to zero), the angle is closer to œÄ. Therefore, the minimum value of Œ± would be the smallest angle, which is the one closest to œÄ/2, corresponding to the steepest negative slope.But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum value of Œ±. So, if Œ± is between œÄ/2 and œÄ, the minimum value would be the smallest angle in that interval, which is œÄ/2. But œÄ/2 is not an option here. The options are 0, œÄ/4, 2œÄ/3, 3œÄ/4.Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the angle is considered as the smallest positive angle, so for negative slopes, it's measured as œÄ - arctan(|m|). So, the angle Œ± is in the second quadrant, and it's equal to œÄ - arctan(|m|). Therefore, the minimum value of Œ± would correspond to the maximum value of arctan(|m|), which is when |m| is maximum.So, to find the minimum Œ±, I need to find the maximum |m|, which is the maximum slope magnitude. Since the slope is negative, the maximum |m| occurs when y‚Äô is most negative.So, let's find the maximum of |y‚Äô|. Since y‚Äô = -4e^x / (e^x + 1)^2, the magnitude is |y‚Äô| = 4e^x / (e^x + 1)^2.I need to find the maximum value of 4e^x / (e^x + 1)^2.Let me set t = e^x, which is always positive because e^x > 0 for all real x. Then, the expression becomes 4t / (t + 1)^2.So, I need to find the maximum of f(t) = 4t / (t + 1)^2 for t > 0.To find the maximum, I can take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it equal to zero.f(t) = 4t / (t + 1)^2f‚Äô(t) = [4*(t + 1)^2 - 4t*2(t + 1)] / (t + 1)^4Let me compute the numerator:4*(t + 1)^2 - 8t*(t + 1) = 4(t^2 + 2t + 1) - 8t(t + 1) = 4t^2 + 8t + 4 - 8t^2 - 8t = (-4t^2) + 0t + 4So, f‚Äô(t) = (-4t^2 + 4) / (t + 1)^4Set f‚Äô(t) = 0:-4t^2 + 4 = 0 => -4t^2 = -4 => t^2 = 1 => t = 1 (since t > 0)So, the maximum occurs at t = 1.Therefore, the maximum |m| is f(1) = 4*1 / (1 + 1)^2 = 4 / 4 = 1.So, the maximum slope magnitude is 1, which occurs when t = e^x = 1 => x = 0.Therefore, the slope at x = 0 is y‚Äô = -4*1 / (1 + 1)^2 = -1.So, the maximum |m| is 1, which corresponds to the steepest negative slope.Therefore, the angle Œ± is œÄ - arctan(1) = œÄ - œÄ/4 = 3œÄ/4.So, the minimum value of Œ± is 3œÄ/4.Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The angle Œ± is measured from the positive x-axis to the tangent line in the counterclockwise direction. For a negative slope, the angle is in the second quadrant. The steeper the negative slope, the closer the angle is to œÄ/2. But since we're looking for the minimum angle Œ±, which is the smallest angle in the second quadrant, that would be the one closest to œÄ/2. However, in this case, the maximum slope magnitude is 1, which corresponds to an angle of œÄ - œÄ/4 = 3œÄ/4.But wait, 3œÄ/4 is larger than œÄ/2, so it's actually the angle closer to œÄ. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.Wait, let's think about it differently. The angle Œ± is such that tan(Œ±) = m. For m negative, Œ± is in the second quadrant. The minimum value of Œ± would be the smallest angle in that quadrant, which is the one closest to œÄ/2. But the angle closest to œÄ/2 would correspond to the steepest slope, which is when |m| is maximum.But in our case, the maximum |m| is 1, so tan(Œ±) = -1, which means Œ± = 3œÄ/4 because tan(3œÄ/4) = -1. So, that's the angle.Therefore, the minimum value of Œ± is 3œÄ/4, which is option D.I think that makes sense. Let me double-check my steps:1. Found the derivative correctly using the quotient rule.2. Simplified the derivative to y‚Äô = -4e^x / (e^x + 1)^2.3. Recognized that the slope is negative, so Œ± is in the second quadrant.4. To find the minimum Œ±, need to find the maximum |m|, which corresponds to the steepest slope.5. Substituted t = e^x and found the maximum of 4t / (t + 1)^2 occurs at t = 1, giving |m| = 1.6. Therefore, tan(Œ±) = -1, so Œ± = 3œÄ/4.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be D: 3œÄ/4."},{"question":"Given points ( A(6, 1), B(-5, -4), C(-2, 5) ). Write the equation of the line on which the altitude of triangle ( ABC ) lies, drawn from vertex ( A ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the equation of the altitude from vertex A in triangle ABC. The points given are A(6, 1), B(-5, -4), and C(-2, 5). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that an altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line dropped from a vertex to the opposite side. So, in this case, the altitude from A should be perpendicular to the line BC. That makes sense because the altitude needs to intersect BC at a right angle.Alright, so to find the equation of this altitude, I think I need two things: the slope of the line BC and then the slope of the altitude, which should be the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC since they are perpendicular.Let me start by finding the slope of BC. The formula for the slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So, plugging in the coordinates for B and C:Slope of BC = (5 - (-4))/(-2 - (-5)) = (5 + 4)/(-2 + 5) = 9/3 = 3.Okay, so the slope of BC is 3. That means the slope of the altitude from A, which is perpendicular to BC, should be the negative reciprocal of 3. The reciprocal of 3 is 1/3, so the negative reciprocal is -1/3.Now that I have the slope of the altitude, which is -1/3, and I know it passes through point A(6, 1), I can use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation. The point-slope formula is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is the point.Plugging in the values:y - 1 = (-1/3)(x - 6).Let me simplify this equation. First, distribute the -1/3 on the right side:y - 1 = (-1/3)x + 2.Then, add 1 to both sides to solve for y:y = (-1/3)x + 3.Hmm, that looks good. But sometimes, equations are preferred in standard form, which is Ax + By + C = 0. So, let me rearrange this equation:(1/3)x + y - 3 = 0.To eliminate the fraction, I can multiply every term by 3:x + 3y - 9 = 0.So, the equation of the altitude from A is x + 3y - 9 = 0.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Calculated slope of BC correctly: (5 - (-4))/(-2 - (-5)) = 9/3 = 3. Then, the negative reciprocal is indeed -1/3. Used point-slope with point A(6,1): y - 1 = (-1/3)(x - 6). Distribute and simplify: y = (-1/3)x + 2 + 1 = (-1/3)x + 3. Convert to standard form: x + 3y - 9 = 0. Yep, that seems correct.Just to be thorough, maybe I should verify if this line is indeed perpendicular to BC. The slope of BC is 3, and the slope of the altitude is -1/3. Multiplying them together: 3 * (-1/3) = -1. Perfect, that confirms they are perpendicular.Also, does this line pass through point A(6,1)? Let's plug in x = 6 and y = 1 into the equation x + 3y - 9 = 0:6 + 3(1) - 9 = 6 + 3 - 9 = 0. Yes, it satisfies the equation. So, everything checks out.I think I've got it right.

Let me try to understand what it's asking. We have an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, and S_n represents the sum of the first n terms. The problem gives me that (S_{2020}/2020) - (S_{20}/20) = 2000, and I need to find the common difference d of the sequence. The options are A:1, B:-1, C:2, D:-2.Alright, let's recall some formulas about arithmetic sequences. The sum of the first n terms, S_n, is given by the formula:S_n = (n/2) * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.Alternatively, this can also be written as:S_n = n * a_1 + (n(n - 1)/2) * dHmm, okay. So, if I need to find S_n / n, that would be:(S_n) / n = a_1 + (n - 1)d / 2Right? Because if I divide the sum by n, it's like taking the average of the first n terms. So, the average of the first n terms in an arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and nth terms. That makes sense because in an arithmetic sequence, the terms are evenly spaced.So, (S_n)/n = (a_1 + a_n)/2. Since a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, substituting that in, we get:(S_n)/n = (a_1 + a_1 + (n - 1)d)/2 = a_1 + (n - 1)d/2Which matches what I had before.So, the problem gives me:(S_{2020}/2020) - (S_{20}/20) = 2000Using the formula I just derived, this becomes:[a_1 + (2020 - 1)d/2] - [a_1 + (20 - 1)d/2] = 2000Simplify this:[a_1 + (2019)d/2] - [a_1 + (19)d/2] = 2000The a_1 terms cancel out:(2019d/2 - 19d/2) = 2000Factor out d/2:(2019 - 19)d/2 = 2000Calculate 2019 - 19:2000d/2 = 2000Simplify 2000d/2:1000d = 2000Divide both sides by 1000:d = 2So, the common difference d is 2.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I notice that both factors on the left side are similar in structure. Maybe I can apply some inequality here, like the AM-GM inequality. I remember that the AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Since (a) and (b) are positive, this should be applicable.Let me look at the first factor: (a^{2}b + a + b^{2}). I have three terms here: (a^{2}b), (a), and (b^{2}). Maybe I can apply AM-GM to these three terms. The AM-GM inequality for three terms says that (frac{x + y + z}{3} geq sqrt[3]{xyz}), with equality when (x = y = z).Applying this to (a^{2}b), (a), and (b^{2}), I get:[frac{a^{2}b + a + b^{2}}{3} geq sqrt[3]{a^{2}b cdot a cdot b^{2}}]Let me compute the geometric mean on the right side:[sqrt[3]{a^{2}b cdot a cdot b^{2}} = sqrt[3]{a^{3}b^{3}} = ab]So, multiplying both sides by 3:[a^{2}b + a + b^{2} geq 3ab]Similarly, let's apply the same reasoning to the second factor: (ab^{2} + a^{2} + b). Again, three terms: (ab^{2}), (a^{2}), and (b). Applying AM-GM:[frac{ab^{2} + a^{2} + b}{3} geq sqrt[3]{ab^{2} cdot a^{2} cdot b}]Calculating the geometric mean:[sqrt[3]{ab^{2} cdot a^{2} cdot b} = sqrt[3]{a^{3}b^{3}} = ab]Multiplying both sides by 3:[ab^{2} + a^{2} + b geq 3ab]So now, I have both factors on the left side of the original inequality each being greater than or equal to (3ab). Therefore, multiplying these two inequalities together:[(a^{2}b + a + b^{2})(ab^{2} + a^{2} + b) geq (3ab)(3ab) = 9a^{2}b^{2}]Hmm, so that gives me the inequality I need, but wait, the original problem says it's strictly greater than (9a^{2}b^{2}). The AM-GM inequality gives me a greater than or equal to, but since (a) and (b) are distinct, maybe the equality condition doesn't hold here.Let me recall when equality holds in AM-GM. It holds when all the terms are equal. So for the first factor, (a^{2}b = a = b^{2}). Let's see what that implies.If (a^{2}b = a), then (a^{2}b = a) implies (a b = 1), assuming (a neq 0), which it isn't because it's positive. Similarly, (a = b^{2}), so substituting (a = b^{2}) into (a b = 1), we get (b^{2} cdot b = 1), so (b^{3} = 1), which means (b = 1). Then (a = b^{2} = 1). So equality holds when (a = b = 1).But in the problem, (a) and (b) are distinct, so (a neq b). Therefore, the equality condition cannot be achieved here. That means the original inequality is strictly greater than (9a^{2}b^{2}).Let me just verify this with an example. Let's take (a = 2) and (b = 1). Then compute each part:First factor: (a^{2}b + a + b^{2} = 4*1 + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7).Second factor: (ab^{2} + a^{2} + b = 2*1 + 4 + 1 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7).Multiplying them: (7 * 7 = 49).Now, (9a^{2}b^{2} = 9*4*1 = 36).So, 49 > 36, which holds true.Another example: (a = 1) and (b = 2).First factor: (1*2 + 1 + 4 = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7).Second factor: (1*4 + 1 + 2 = 4 + 1 + 2 = 7).Multiplying: 49, and (9*1*4 = 36). Again, 49 > 36.What if (a = 3) and (b = 2)?First factor: (9*2 + 3 + 4 = 18 + 3 + 4 = 25).Second factor: (3*4 + 9 + 2 = 12 + 9 + 2 = 23).Multiplying: 25*23 = 575.(9a^{2}b^{2} = 9*9*4 = 324). So, 575 > 324.Seems consistent.Wait, let me try with (a = 1) and (b = 1). But they are not distinct, so that's not allowed. But if I compute it, ( (1 + 1 + 1)(1 + 1 + 1) = 3*3 = 9), and (9*1*1 = 9). So equality holds when (a = b = 1), but since (a) and (b) are distinct, we don't have to worry about that case.Therefore, since (a neq b), the equality condition is excluded, so the inequality is strict.I think that makes sense. So, by applying AM-GM to each factor, we get that each is at least (3ab), and multiplying them gives at least (9a^{2}b^{2}). Since (a) and (b) are distinct, we don't have equality, so it's strictly greater.I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. Maybe I should check if the AM-GM application was correct.For the first factor: (a^{2}b), (a), (b^{2}). Their product is (a^{3}b^{3}), so the cube root is (ab). So, AM-GM gives the sum is at least (3ab). Similarly for the second factor: (ab^{2}), (a^{2}), (b). Their product is also (a^{3}b^{3}), so same result.Yes, that seems correct. So, multiplying both inequalities, we get the desired result, and since (a neq b), the inequality is strict.I think that's solid. I can't think of any edge cases or mistakes here.**Final Answer**boxed{(a^{2}b + a + b^{2})(ab^{2} + a^{2} + b) > 9a^{2}b^{2}}"},{"question":"Given the line 4x + 7y = 28 and a point on this line equidistant from the coordinate axes.

I need to figure out in which quadrants such a point exists. The options are from A to E, with E being that the point exists in each of the quadrants. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, what does it mean for a point to be equidistant from the coordinate axes? Well, the coordinate axes are the x-axis and y-axis. So, a point that's equidistant from both axes would have its x-coordinate equal in absolute value to its y-coordinate. In other words, |x| = |y|. That means either y = x or y = -x. Got it.So, if I can find points on the line 4x + 7y = 28 where either y = x or y = -x, those points will be equidistant from both axes. Let me try substituting these into the equation of the line.Starting with y = x. If I substitute y with x in the equation, I get:4x + 7x = 28That simplifies to 11x = 28, so x = 28/11. Since y = x, y is also 28/11. So, the point is (28/11, 28/11). Both coordinates are positive, so this point is in the first quadrant. Okay, that's one point.Now, let's try y = -x. Substituting y with -x in the equation:4x + 7(-x) = 28That simplifies to 4x - 7x = 28, which is -3x = 28. So, x = -28/3. Since y = -x, y would be 28/3. So, the point is (-28/3, 28/3). Here, x is negative and y is positive, so this point is in the second quadrant.Wait, so we have two points: one in the first quadrant and one in the second quadrant. So, does that mean the points exist in quadrants I and II only? Let me check if there are any other possibilities.Well, the condition |x| = |y| only gives us two cases: y = x and y = -x. We've already checked both, and each gives us a point in a different quadrant. So, no other quadrants are involved here.Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me verify the calculations.For y = x:4x + 7x = 2811x = 28x = 28/11 ‚âà 2.545y = 28/11 ‚âà 2.545So, the point is approximately (2.545, 2.545), which is definitely in the first quadrant.For y = -x:4x + 7(-x) = 284x - 7x = 28-3x = 28x = -28/3 ‚âà -9.333y = -x = 28/3 ‚âà 9.333So, the point is approximately (-9.333, 9.333), which is in the second quadrant.Hmm, both points check out. So, there are points on the line 4x + 7y = 28 that are equidistant from both axes, and these points lie in the first and second quadrants. There are no points in the third or fourth quadrants because substituting y = x or y = -x doesn't give us points in those quadrants.Wait, let me think about the third quadrant. In the third quadrant, both x and y are negative. So, if I had a point where both x and y are negative, would that satisfy 4x + 7y = 28? Let's see.Suppose x is negative and y is negative. Then, 4x would be negative and 7y would be negative, so their sum would be negative. But 28 is positive, so 4x + 7y can't equal 28 if both x and y are negative. Therefore, there are no points in the third quadrant on this line that are equidistant from the axes.Similarly, in the fourth quadrant, x is positive and y is negative. If I set y = -x, then y would be negative if x is positive, which is the case for the fourth quadrant. But when I substituted y = -x earlier, I got a point in the second quadrant, not the fourth. Let me see why.Wait, if I set y = -x, and x is positive, then y would be negative, which would be in the fourth quadrant. But when I solved for x, I got x = -28/3, which is negative, so y = 28/3 is positive. So, that point is in the second quadrant. If I wanted a point in the fourth quadrant, would that be possible?Let me try solving for y = -x again, but this time, assuming x is positive and y is negative. So, if x is positive, then y = -x would be negative. Let's substitute y = -x into the equation:4x + 7(-x) = 284x - 7x = 28-3x = 28x = -28/3But x is negative here, which contradicts our assumption that x is positive in the fourth quadrant. So, there's no solution in the fourth quadrant because it would require x to be negative, which isn't consistent with the fourth quadrant's definition.Therefore, the only points on the line 4x + 7y = 28 that are equidistant from the axes are in the first and second quadrants. So, the answer should be quadrants I and II only.I think that's it. I don't see any other possibilities, and my calculations seem to check out. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is quadrants I and II only."},{"question":"If ( 4^{3x} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^x ), what is the value of ( (x^3 + 2) )?- **(A)** 29- **(B)** 10- **(C)** 64- **(D)** 9- **(E)** 27","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: (4^{3x} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^x). Hmm, I need to find the value of (x^3 + 2). Alright, let's see how to approach this.First, I notice that (4^{3x}) can be written as ((4^x)^3). That might be helpful because it looks like a cubic term. Let me rewrite the equation:[(4^x)^3 + 64 = 68 cdot 4^x]Hmm, this looks a bit like a quadratic equation, but it's actually a cubic equation. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me let (u = 4^x). Then, (4^{3x} = (4^x)^3 = u^3).

Let me rearrange it to standard form:[u^3 - 68u + 64 = 0]Okay, now I need to solve this cubic equation.

Maybe I made a mistake in my approach.Wait, perhaps I should factor the cubic equation differently. Let me see if I can factor (u^3 - 68u + 64). Maybe using rational root theorem, possible roots are factors of 64 over factors of 1, so possible roots are ¬±1, ¬±2, ¬±4, ¬±8, ¬±16, ¬±32, ¬±64.I tried 1, 2, 4, 8, 64, and none worked. Maybe I missed something. Let me try (u = 64) again, but that was too big. Maybe I need to factor it another way.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as (u^3 + 64 = 68u). Wait, (u^3 + 64) is a sum of cubes, right? Because (64 = 4^3). So, (u^3 + 4^3 = (u + 4)(u^2 - 4u + 16)). So, let's try that:[(u + 4)(u^2 - 4u + 16) = 68u]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can bring everything to one side:[(u + 4)(u^2 - 4u + 16) - 68u = 0]Expanding this:[u^3 - 4u^2 + 16u + 4u^2 - 16u + 64 - 68u = 0]Simplify:[u^3 + 0u^2 + (16u - 16u - 68u) + 64 = 0]Which simplifies to:[u^3 - 68u + 64 = 0]Wait, that's the same equation I started with. So, that didn't help. Maybe I need to use the cubic formula or numerical methods. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps there's a simpler way.Wait, maybe I can assume that (u = 4^x) is a power of 4, so maybe (u) is 4, 16, 64, etc. Let me try (u = 4):[4^3 - 68(4) + 64 = 64 - 272 + 64 = -144 neq 0]Nope. How about (u = 16):[16^3 - 68(16) + 64 = 4096 - 1088 + 64 = 4096 - 1088 = 3008; 3008 + 64 = 3072 neq 0]Too big. Maybe (u = 8):[8^3 - 68(8) + 64 = 512 - 544 + 64 = 32 neq 0]Still not zero. Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that (u = 4^x) must be positive, so perhaps the only real solution is when (u = 64), even though when I plugged it in earlier, it didn't seem to work. Wait, let me double-check:If (u = 64):[64^3 - 68(64) + 64 = 262144 - 4352 + 64 = 262144 - 4352 = 257792; 257792 + 64 = 257856]That's definitely not zero. So, maybe I made a mistake in my substitution.Wait, going back to the original equation:[4^{3x} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^x]I rewrote it as:[(4^x)^3 + 64 = 68 cdot 4^x]Which led to:[u^3 + 64 = 68u]But when I rearranged, I got:[u^3 - 68u + 64 = 0]Wait, actually, that's correct. So, maybe I need to factor this cubic equation differently. Let me try to factor it as:[u^3 - 68u + 64 = (u - a)(u^2 + bu + c)]Expanding the right side:[u^3 + (b - a)u^2 + (c - ab)u - ac]Comparing coefficients:1. (b - a = 0) (since there's no (u^2) term)2. (c - ab = -68)3. (-ac = 64)From equation 1: (b = a)From equation 3: (-ac = 64), so (ac = -64)From equation 2: (c - a^2 = -68)So, we have:(c = a^2 - 68)And from equation 3:(a(a^2 - 68) = -64)So:(a^3 - 68a + 64 = 0)Wait, that's the same equation as before. So, this approach isn't helping. Maybe I need to use the rational root theorem again, but perhaps I missed a possible root.Wait, maybe (u = 64) is a root, but when I plug it in, it doesn't satisfy the equation. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier. Let me double-check:(64^3 = 262144)(68 times 64 = 4352)So,(262144 - 4352 + 64 = 262144 - 4352 = 257792; 257792 + 64 = 257856)Yes, that's correct. So, (u = 64) is not a root. Hmm.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that (4^{3x} = (4^x)^3), so let me let (y = 4^x), then the equation becomes:[y^3 + 64 = 68y]Which is the same as:[y^3 - 68y + 64 = 0]I need to solve for (y). Maybe I can use the rational root theorem again, but I already tried that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of depressed cubic or some substitution.Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:[y^3 = 68y - 64]And then try to find a real solution numerically. Let me try (y = 64):[64^3 = 262144][68 times 64 - 64 = 4352 - 64 = 4288]262144 is much larger than 4288, so (y = 64) is not a solution.Wait, maybe I can try smaller values. Let me try (y = 4):[4^3 = 64][68 times 4 - 64 = 272 - 64 = 208]64 ‚â† 208.How about (y = 8):[8^3 = 512][68 times 8 - 64 = 544 - 64 = 480]512 ‚â† 480.Hmm, getting closer. Let me try (y = 7):[7^3 = 343][68 times 7 - 64 = 476 - 64 = 412]343 < 412.Wait, so at (y = 7), LHS = 343, RHS = 412.At (y = 8), LHS = 512, RHS = 480.So, between (y = 7) and (y = 8), the LHS crosses the RHS. So, there's a real root between 7 and 8.But since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are integers, maybe the solution is (y = 64), but that didn't work. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution.Wait, going back to the original equation:[4^{3x} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^x]Let me try (x = 3):[4^{9} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^3][262144 + 64 = 68 times 64][262208 = 4352]Nope, that's not equal. So, (x = 3) is not a solution.Wait, maybe (x = 1):[4^{3} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^1][64 + 64 = 272][128 = 272]Nope.How about (x = 2):[4^{6} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^2][4096 + 64 = 68 times 16][4160 = 1088]Nope.Wait, maybe (x = 0):[4^{0} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^0][1 + 64 = 68 times 1][65 = 68]Nope.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me consider that (4^{3x} = (4^x)^3), so let me let (y = 4^x), then the equation becomes:[y^3 + 64 = 68y]Which is:[y^3 - 68y + 64 = 0]I need to solve this cubic equation. Maybe I can use the rational root theorem again, but I already tried that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of depressed cubic.The general form of a depressed cubic is (t^3 + pt + q = 0). In this case, (p = -68) and (q = 64).The depressed cubic formula is:[t = sqrt[3]{-frac{q}{2} + sqrt{left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{-frac{q}{2} - sqrt{left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3}}]Plugging in the values:[t = sqrt[3]{-frac{64}{2} + sqrt{left(frac{64}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{-68}{3}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{-frac{64}{2} - sqrt{left(frac{64}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{-68}{3}right)^3}}]Simplify:[t = sqrt[3]{-32 + sqrt{32^2 + left(-frac{68}{3}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{-32 - sqrt{32^2 + left(-frac{68}{3}right)^3}}]Calculate inside the square root:[32^2 = 1024][left(-frac{68}{3}right)^3 = -frac{68^3}{27} = -frac{314432}{27} approx -11645.63]So,[sqrt{1024 + (-11645.63)} = sqrt{-10621.63}]Wait, that's the square root of a negative number, which is imaginary. So, the cubic has one real root and two complex roots. Therefore, the real root can be found using the depressed cubic formula, but it's complicated.Alternatively, maybe I can use numerical methods to approximate the real root. Let me try the Newton-Raphson method.Let me define (f(y) = y^3 - 68y + 64). I need to find a root of (f(y) = 0).I know that (f(7) = 343 - 476 + 64 = -69)(f(8) = 512 - 544 + 64 = 32)So, the root is between 7 and 8.Let me start with an initial guess (y_0 = 7.5)Calculate (f(7.5)):[7.5^3 = 421.875][68 times 7.5 = 510][f(7.5) = 421.875 - 510 + 64 = -24.125]So, (f(7.5) = -24.125)Next, calculate (f'(y) = 3y^2 - 68)At (y = 7.5):[f'(7.5) = 3*(7.5)^2 - 68 = 3*56.25 - 68 = 168.75 - 68 = 100.75]Now, apply Newton-Raphson:[y_1 = y_0 - frac{f(y_0)}{f'(y_0)} = 7.5 - frac{-24.125}{100.75} ‚âà 7.5 + 0.239 ‚âà 7.739]Now, calculate (f(7.739)):[7.739^3 ‚âà 7.739 * 7.739 * 7.739 ‚âà 7.739 * 59.88 ‚âà 462.5][68 * 7.739 ‚âà 527.05][f(7.739) ‚âà 462.5 - 527.05 + 64 ‚âà -1.55]So, (f(7.739) ‚âà -1.55)Calculate (f'(7.739)):[f'(7.739) = 3*(7.739)^2 - 68 ‚âà 3*59.88 - 68 ‚âà 179.64 - 68 ‚âà 111.64]Next iteration:[y_2 = 7.739 - frac{-1.55}{111.64} ‚âà 7.739 + 0.0139 ‚âà 7.7529]Calculate (f(7.7529)):[7.7529^3 ‚âà 7.7529 * 7.7529 * 7.7529 ‚âà 7.7529 * 59.99 ‚âà 464.0][68 * 7.7529 ‚âà 528.19][f(7.7529) ‚âà 464.0 - 528.19 + 64 ‚âà 0.81]So, (f(7.7529) ‚âà 0.81)Now, (f(7.7529) ‚âà 0.81), which is positive, while (f(7.739) ‚âà -1.55). So, the root is between 7.739 and 7.7529.Let me take the midpoint: 7.74595Calculate (f(7.74595)):[7.74595^3 ‚âà 7.74595 * 7.74595 * 7.74595 ‚âà 7.74595 * 59.99 ‚âà 464.0][68 * 7.74595 ‚âà 528.19][f(7.74595) ‚âà 464.0 - 528.19 + 64 ‚âà 0.81]Wait, that's the same as before. Maybe I need to do another iteration.Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the real root is approximately 7.75.But since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are integers, maybe the solution is (x = 3), even though when I plugged it in earlier, it didn't seem to work. Wait, let me check again.If (x = 3), then (4^x = 64), so (u = 64). Plugging into the equation:[64^3 + 64 = 68 * 64][262144 + 64 = 4352][262208 = 4352]No, that's not correct. So, (x = 3) is not a solution.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my substitution. Let me go back.Original equation:[4^{3x} + 64 = 68 cdot 4^x]Let me let (y = 4^x), so (4^{3x} = y^3). Then the equation becomes:[y^3 + 64 = 68y]Which is:[y^3 - 68y + 64 = 0]I need to solve this cubic equation. Maybe I can factor it as:[(y - a)(y^2 + by + c) = 0]Expanding:[y^3 + (b - a)y^2 + (c - ab)y - ac = 0]Comparing coefficients:1. (b - a = 0) (since there's no (y^2) term)2. (c - ab = -68)3. (-ac = 64)From equation 1: (b = a)From equation 3: (ac = -64)From equation 2: (c - a^2 = -68)So, (c = a^2 - 68)Substitute into equation 3:[a(a^2 - 68) = -64][a^3 - 68a + 64 = 0]Wait, that's the same equation as before. So, this approach isn't helping. Maybe I need to use the fact that (y = 4^x) must be a power of 4, so perhaps (y = 4), (16), (64), etc. Let me try (y = 4):[4^3 - 68*4 + 64 = 64 - 272 + 64 = -144 neq 0]Nope. How about (y = 16):[16^3 - 68*16 + 64 = 4096 - 1088 + 64 = 3072 neq 0]Too big. Maybe (y = 8):[8^3 - 68*8 + 64 = 512 - 544 + 64 = 32 neq 0]Still not zero. Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that (y = 4^x) is not an integer, but a real number. So, perhaps the real solution is approximately 7.75, as I found earlier.If (y ‚âà 7.75), then (4^x ‚âà 7.75). Taking logarithm base 4:[x ‚âà log_4(7.75)]We know that (4^1 = 4), (4^{1.5} = 8), so (x) is between 1 and 1.5. Let me calculate it more precisely.Using natural logarithm:[x = frac{ln(7.75)}{ln(4)} ‚âà frac{2.049}{1.386} ‚âà 1.48]So, (x ‚âà 1.48). Then, (x^3 + 2 ‚âà (1.48)^3 + 2 ‚âà 3.24 + 2 = 5.24). But this is not one of the options. The options are 29, 10, 64, 9, 27.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Let me try a different substitution.Let me let (t = 4^x), so the equation becomes:[t^3 + 64 = 68t]Which is:[t^3 - 68t + 64 = 0]I need to solve this cubic equation. Maybe I can factor it as:[(t - a)(t^2 + bt + c) = 0]Expanding:[t^3 + (b - a)t^2 + (c - ab)t - ac = 0]Comparing coefficients:1. (b - a = 0) (no (t^2) term)2. (c - ab = -68)3. (-ac = 64)From equation 1: (b = a)From equation 3: (ac = -64)From equation 2: (c - a^2 = -68)So, (c = a^2 - 68)Substitute into equation 3:[a(a^2 - 68) = -64][a^3 - 68a + 64 = 0]Again, same equation. So, no help.Wait, maybe I can try to factor the cubic equation as:[t^3 - 68t + 64 = (t - 64)(t^2 + 64t + 1)]Let me check:[(t - 64)(t^2 + 64t + 1) = t^3 + 64t^2 + t - 64t^2 - 4096t - 64 = t^3 - 4095t - 64]Nope, that's not the same as the original equation. So, that's incorrect.Wait, maybe I can factor it as:[(t - 1)(t^2 + t - 64) = t^3 + t^2 - 64t - t^2 - t + 64 = t^3 - 65t + 64]Close, but not quite. The original equation is (t^3 - 68t + 64). So, not the same.Alternatively, maybe:[(t - 2)(t^2 + 2t - 32) = t^3 + 2t^2 - 32t - 2t^2 - 4t + 64 = t^3 - 36t + 64]Still not matching.Wait, maybe:[(t - 4)(t^2 + 4t - 16) = t^3 + 4t^2 - 16t - 4t^2 - 16t + 64 = t^3 - 32t + 64]Still not matching.Hmm, this is getting frustrating.

I remember that the chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. I think the greedy algorithm is a way to color the graph by ordering the vertices and then coloring each vertex with the smallest available color that doesn't conflict with its already colored neighbors. But how does that help me show that the chromatic number is bounded by D(G) + 1?Maybe I should start by considering how the greedy algorithm works step by step. Suppose I have a graph G with maximum degree D(G). If I order the vertices in some sequence, say v1, v2, ..., vn, then for each vertex vi, I look at its already colored neighbors and assign it the smallest color not used by those neighbors.Now, for any vertex vi, it has at most D(G) neighbors. So, when I get to color vi, its neighbors could be using up to D(G) different colors. That means, in the worst case, I might need to use D(G) + 1 colors to ensure that vi gets a color different from all its neighbors.But wait, does this always hold? What if the graph has a specific structure that allows for fewer colors? For example, in a tree, the greedy algorithm would only need 2 colors, right? But a tree has maximum degree at least 2 (unless it's a single edge), so 2 ‚â§ D(G) + 1. That seems to fit.Maybe I should think about it more formally. Let's assume that I'm using the greedy algorithm with some ordering of the vertices. For each vertex, the number of colors used by its neighbors is at most D(G). Therefore, the number of colors needed for the entire graph should be at most D(G) + 1.But is there a case where the greedy algorithm would require more than D(G) + 1 colors? I don't think so because each vertex only has D(G) neighbors, and thus, the number of conflicting colors is limited to D(G). So, by choosing the smallest available color, we ensure that we don't exceed D(G) + 1 colors.Hmm, but what if the graph is a complete graph? In that case, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so the chromatic number would be equal to the number of vertices, which is much larger than D(G) + 1. Wait, that contradicts the statement. But in a complete graph with n vertices, the maximum degree D(G) is n - 1, so D(G) + 1 is n, which matches the chromatic number. So, it still holds.Okay, maybe I was confused earlier, but it seems that the bound holds even for complete graphs. So, the greedy algorithm, when applied to any ordering, ensures that the number of colors used is at most D(G) + 1.I think I need to formalize this argument. Let me try to outline it:1. Assume we have a graph G with maximum degree D(G).2. Order the vertices in any sequence: v1, v2, ..., vn.3. Apply the greedy coloring algorithm: for each vertex vi, assign the smallest color not used by its already colored neighbors.4. For each vertex vi, it has at most D(G) neighbors, so at most D(G) colors are used by its neighbors.5. Therefore, there is always at least one color available among the first D(G) + 1 colors that can be assigned to vi.6. Hence, the entire graph can be colored with D(G) + 1 colors.7. Therefore, the chromatic number œá(G) ‚â§ D(G) + 1.This seems logical. The key point is that each vertex has a limited number of neighbors, so the number of conflicting colors is bounded, allowing us to use a bounded number of colors overall.I should also consider if the ordering of the vertices affects this bound. From what I recall, the performance of the greedy algorithm can depend on the ordering. However, regardless of the ordering, the maximum degree constraint ensures that no vertex will have more than D(G) neighbors, so the bound should still hold.In summary, by using the greedy algorithm and considering the maximum degree of the graph, we can ensure that the chromatic number does not exceed D(G) + 1."},{"question":"Among the following analyses of a dataset, the incorrect statement is ( ).A: The smaller the standard deviation of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.B: The smaller the mean of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.C: The smaller the range of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.D: The smaller the variance of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about analyzing a dataset, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's take it step by step.First, let's read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly:\\"Among the following analyses of a dataset, the incorrect statement is ( ).A: The smaller the standard deviation of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.B: The smaller the mean of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.C: The smaller the range of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.D: The smaller the variance of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.\\"Okay, so I need to identify which of these statements is incorrect regarding the concentration and stability of a sample data distribution.Let's start by recalling some basic statistical concepts to understand what each of these terms means.1. **Mean**: This is the average value of the dataset. It's calculated by summing all the data points and dividing by the number of data points. The mean gives us a central tendency of the data but doesn't directly tell us about the spread or concentration of the data.2. **Standard Deviation**: This measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation means that the values tend to be close to the mean, whereas a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.3. **Variance**: This is another measure of how spread out the numbers in a dataset are. It's the square of the standard deviation. Like standard deviation, a lower variance indicates that the data points are closer to the mean and hence more concentrated.4. **Range**: This is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. A smaller range suggests that the data points are closer together, indicating more concentration.Now, let's analyze each statement one by one.**Statement A**: \\"The smaller the standard deviation of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.\\"From what I recall, standard deviation is a measure of spread. A smaller standard deviation means the data points are closer to the mean, which implies a more concentrated and stable distribution. This makes sense because if the data is tightly clustered around the mean, it's less likely to have extreme values, making the distribution more stable. So, Statement A seems correct.**Statement B**: \\"The smaller the mean of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.\\"Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. The mean is a measure of central tendency, not spread. A smaller mean just tells us that, on average, the data points are lower, but it doesn't necessarily say anything about how spread out or concentrated the data is. For example, imagine two datasets: one with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2, and another with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 10. The second dataset has a smaller mean but a larger spread, meaning it's actually less concentrated. Therefore, the mean alone doesn't determine the concentration or stability of the distribution. This makes Statement B suspect.**Statement C**: \\"The smaller the range of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.\\"The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. A smaller range means that the data spans a narrower interval, which implies that the data points are closer together. This would result in a more concentrated and stable distribution. So, Statement C seems correct.**Statement D**: \\"The smaller the variance of the data, the more concentrated and stable the sample data distribution.\\"Variance is similar to standard deviation in that it measures the spread of the data. A smaller variance indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, leading to a more concentrated and stable distribution. This aligns with what I know, so Statement D is correct.After analyzing all four statements, it's clear that Statement B is the incorrect one. The mean doesn't directly relate to the concentration or stability of the data distribution; instead, measures like standard deviation, variance, and range are more relevant for that.To double-check, let's think of an example. Suppose we have two datasets:- Dataset 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with a mean of 3, standard deviation of approximately 1.41, variance of approximately 2, and range of 4.- Dataset 2: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] with a mean of 7, standard deviation of approximately 1.41, variance of approximately 2, and range of 4.Both datasets have the same standard deviation, variance, and range, but different means. Despite having different means, their concentration and stability are the same because the spread is identical. This reinforces that the mean alone doesn't affect concentration or stability.Another example could be:- Dataset A: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10] with a mean of 10, standard deviation of 0, variance of 0, and range of 0.- Dataset B: [5, 15, 25, 35, 45] with a mean of 25, standard deviation of approximately 14.14, variance of 200, and range of 40.Here, Dataset A has a higher mean than Dataset B, but it's actually more concentrated and stable because its standard deviation, variance, and range are all smaller. This further shows that the mean isn't the determining factor for concentration or stability.Therefore, Statement B is indeed incorrect because it incorrectly associates the mean with the concentration and stability of the data distribution, which are actually determined by measures of spread like standard deviation, variance, and range.In summary, while Statements A, C, and D correctly relate measures of spread to the concentration and stability of a dataset, Statement B incorrectly attributes these characteristics to the mean, which is unrelated to spread."},{"question":"In a rhombus where one diagonal is three times the length of the other diagonal, determine the expression for the side of the rhombus in terms of its area K (in square units).A) ( sqrt{frac{2K}{3}} )B) ( sqrt{frac{5K}{3}} )C) ( sqrt{frac{5K}{6}} )D) ( sqrt{frac{9K}{4}} )E) ( sqrt{frac{12K}{5}} )","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombus where one diagonal is three times the length of the other. I need to find the expression for the side of the rhombus in terms of its area, K. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula involving the diagonals. First, let me recall the formula for the area of a rhombus. I think it's (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So, if one diagonal is three times the other, I can denote the shorter diagonal as, say, d. Then the longer diagonal would be 3d. So, plugging that into the area formula, K = (d * 3d) / 2. Simplifying that, K = (3d¬≤) / 2. Okay, so that gives me a relationship between the area K and the diagonal d. But I need to find the side of the rhombus in terms of K. I remember that in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, if I consider one of the four right triangles formed by the intersection of the diagonals, each triangle will have legs of length d/2 and 3d/2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the side length s of the rhombus can be found by s¬≤ = (d/2)¬≤ + (3d/2)¬≤. Let me compute that. First, (d/2)¬≤ is d¬≤/4, and (3d/2)¬≤ is 9d¬≤/4. Adding those together, I get d¬≤/4 + 9d¬≤/4 = 10d¬≤/4. Simplifying that, it's 5d¬≤/2. So, s¬≤ = 5d¬≤/2, which means s = sqrt(5d¬≤/2). But I need s in terms of K, not d. Earlier, I found that K = (3d¬≤)/2. So, let me solve for d¬≤. From K = (3d¬≤)/2, multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2K = 3d¬≤, so d¬≤ = (2K)/3. Now, substitute d¬≤ back into the expression for s. So, s = sqrt(5*(2K/3)/2). Let me simplify that. The 5*(2K/3) is 10K/3, and then divided by 2 is 5K/3. So, s = sqrt(5K/3). Wait, let me double-check that substitution. I have s¬≤ = 5d¬≤/2, and d¬≤ = (2K)/3. So, s¬≤ = 5*(2K/3)/2. The 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving s¬≤ = 5K/3. Therefore, s = sqrt(5K/3). Looking at the options, that's option B. So, I think the answer is B) sqrt(5K/3). But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. 1. Let the shorter diagonal be d, so the longer diagonal is 3d.2. Area K = (d * 3d)/2 = 3d¬≤/2.3. Solving for d¬≤ gives d¬≤ = (2K)/3.4. Each side of the rhombus is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs d/2 and 3d/2.5. So, s¬≤ = (d/2)¬≤ + (3d/2)¬≤ = d¬≤/4 + 9d¬≤/4 = 10d¬≤/4 = 5d¬≤/2.6. Substitute d¬≤ = (2K)/3 into s¬≤: s¬≤ = 5*(2K/3)/2 = 5K/3.7. Therefore, s = sqrt(5K/3).Yep, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is B."},{"question":"The ratio of irises to roses in Emily's garden is 3:7. Initially, she has 35 roses.

In order to protect the wild animals, it is decided to build a viaduct to provide a safe passage for the migration of wild animals. If the two ends of the viaduct and the piers at both ends have been built, the distance between the piers at the two ends is 1200 meters, and the remaining work only needs to build the bridge deck and piers between the two end piers. According to predictions, the construction cost of one pier is 500 million yuan, and the construction cost of the bridge deck between adjacent piers at a distance of x meters is 10x[ln(x+12)-3] million yuan. Assuming that the piers are evenly distributed at equal distances, all piers are considered as points, and other factors are not considered. Let the cost of the remaining work be y million yuan.  (1) Write the function relationship of y with respect to x.  (2) How many piers need to be built to minimize y? And find its minimum value. Reference data: ln 2 ‚âà 0.69, ln 3 ‚âà 1.10.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about building a viaduct to help wild animals cross safely. The total distance between the two end piers is 1200 meters. The remaining work is to build the bridge deck and the piers in between. Each pier costs 500 million yuan, and the bridge deck between two piers x meters apart costs 10x[ln(x+12) - 3] million yuan. I need to figure out the function relationship of the total cost y with respect to x, and then find the number of piers that minimizes y and its minimum value.Alright, let's start with part (1). I need to express y in terms of x. So, first, I should figure out how many piers are needed. Since the total distance is 1200 meters and the piers are evenly spaced, the number of intervals between piers would be 1200 divided by x. But since we already have the two end piers, the number of additional piers needed is (1200/x) - 1. Each pier costs 500 million yuan, so the total cost for piers is 500*(1200/x - 1).Next, the bridge deck cost. For each interval of x meters, the cost is 10x[ln(x+12) - 3]. Since there are 1200/x intervals, the total bridge deck cost is (1200/x)*10x[ln(x+12) - 3]. The x in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so it simplifies to 12000[ln(x+12) - 3].Now, adding the pier cost and the bridge deck cost together gives the total cost y. So, y = 500*(1200/x - 1) + 12000[ln(x+12) - 3]. Let me write that out:y = (500 * 1200)/x - 500 + 12000*ln(x+12) - 12000*3Simplifying further:y = 600000/x - 500 + 12000*ln(x+12) - 36000Combine the constants:y = 600000/x + 12000*ln(x+12) - 36500Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check. The number of piers is (1200/x - 1), each costing 500, so that's 500*(1200/x - 1). The bridge deck is 10x[ln(x+12)-3] per x meters, so for 1200 meters, it's (1200/x)*10x[ln(x+12)-3] = 12000[ln(x+12)-3]. Adding those together, yes, that gives the expression above.So, part (1) is done. Now, part (2): minimizing y. To minimize y, I need to find the value of x that minimizes the function y(x). Since y is a function of x, I can take its derivative with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.Let me write y again:y = 600000/x + 12000*ln(x+12) - 36500First, let's find dy/dx. The derivative of 600000/x is -600000/x¬≤. The derivative of 12000*ln(x+12) is 12000/(x+12). The derivative of the constant -36500 is zero. So,dy/dx = -600000/x¬≤ + 12000/(x+12)To find the critical points, set dy/dx = 0:-600000/x¬≤ + 12000/(x+12) = 0Let's solve for x:12000/(x+12) = 600000/x¬≤Divide both sides by 12000:1/(x+12) = 50/x¬≤Cross-multiplied:x¬≤ = 50(x + 12)Expand:x¬≤ = 50x + 600Bring all terms to one side:x¬≤ - 50x - 600 = 0Now, solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is x = [50 ¬± sqrt(2500 + 2400)] / 2Compute discriminant:sqrt(2500 + 2400) = sqrt(4900) = 70So,x = [50 + 70]/2 = 120/2 = 60orx = [50 - 70]/2 = (-20)/2 = -10Since x represents a distance, it can't be negative. So, x = 60 meters.Now, I need to confirm that this is indeed a minimum. I can do this by checking the second derivative or analyzing the sign change of the first derivative.Let's compute the second derivative:d¬≤y/dx¬≤ = 1200000/x¬≥ - 12000/(x+12)¬≤At x = 60,d¬≤y/dx¬≤ = 1200000/(60)^3 - 12000/(60+12)^2Calculate each term:60^3 = 2160001200000 / 216000 ‚âà 5.555660 + 12 = 7272^2 = 518412000 / 5184 ‚âà 2.3148So,d¬≤y/dx¬≤ ‚âà 5.5556 - 2.3148 ‚âà 3.2408Since the second derivative is positive at x = 60, this critical point is a local minimum. Therefore, x = 60 meters minimizes y.Now, let's compute the minimum cost y. Substitute x = 60 into the function:y = 600000/60 + 12000*ln(60 + 12) - 36500Simplify:600000 / 60 = 1000060 + 12 = 72So,y = 10000 + 12000*ln(72) - 36500Compute ln(72). Let's see, 72 = 8*9 = 8*3^2. So, ln(72) = ln(8) + ln(9) = 3ln(2) + 2ln(3). Given that ln(2) ‚âà 0.69 and ln(3) ‚âà 1.10,ln(72) ‚âà 3*0.69 + 2*1.10 = 2.07 + 2.20 = 4.27So,12000*ln(72) ‚âà 12000*4.27 = 51240Now,y = 10000 + 51240 - 36500 = (10000 + 51240) - 36500 = 61240 - 36500 = 24740So, the minimum cost y is 24740 million yuan.Now, how many piers need to be built? The number of piers is (1200/x - 1). At x = 60,Number of piers = 1200/60 - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19So, 19 piers need to be built.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The function y was correctly derived by considering the cost of piers and the bridge deck. Then, taking the derivative, setting it to zero, solving for x gave x = 60. The second derivative test confirmed it's a minimum. Substituting back gave the minimum cost and the number of piers. Seems solid.**Final Answer**(1) The function relationship is boxed{y = frac{600000}{x} + 12000ln(x + 12) - 36500}.(2) The number of piers needed is boxed{19} and the minimum cost is boxed{24740} million yuan."},{"question":"The Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway is 166 kilometers long. Suppose a car enters the expressway from Xinzhuang Town, Shanghai, and travels to Hangzhou at a constant speed of no less than 60 kilometers per hour and no more than 120 kilometers per hour.

What is the minimum transportation cost in yuan?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, which is 166 kilometers long. A car is traveling from Xinzhuang Town, Shanghai, to Hangzhou. The car's speed is constant, and it's between 60 km/h and 120 km/h. The transportation cost per hour, y, has two parts: a variable part and a fixed part. The variable part is directly proportional to the square of the speed, v, with a proportionality constant of 0.02. The fixed part is 200 yuan per hour.Alright, so part (1) asks me to express the total transportation cost y as a function of speed v and specify the domain of this function. Let's break this down.First, the total transportation cost depends on two things: the variable cost and the fixed cost. The variable cost is 0.02 times v squared, and the fixed cost is 200 yuan per hour. So, the hourly cost is 0.02v¬≤ + 200 yuan.But wait, the total cost isn't just per hour; it's for the entire trip. Since the car is traveling 166 kilometers, I need to figure out how many hours the trip will take. Time is equal to distance divided by speed, so time t = 166 / v hours.Therefore, the total transportation cost y should be the hourly cost multiplied by the time. So, y = (0.02v¬≤ + 200) * (166 / v). Let me write that out:y = (0.02v¬≤ + 200) * (166 / v)Hmm, let me simplify this expression. Distribute the 166 / v:y = (0.02v¬≤ * 166 / v) + (200 * 166 / v)Simplify each term:First term: 0.02 * 166 * v¬≤ / v = 0.02 * 166 * v = 3.32vSecond term: 200 * 166 / v = 33200 / vSo, putting it together:y = 3.32v + 33200 / vWait, let me check my calculations. 0.02 * 166 is indeed 3.32, and 200 * 166 is 33,200. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can factor out the 166:y = 166 * (0.02v + 200 / v)Yes, that looks cleaner. So, y = 166*(0.02v + 200/v). That might be a better way to express it.Now, the domain of this function is the range of possible speeds v. The problem states that the speed is no less than 60 km/h and no more than 120 km/h. So, the domain is 60 ‚â§ v ‚â§ 120.Alright, so that's part (1). Now, moving on to part (2): At what speed should the car travel to minimize the total transportation cost? What is the minimum transportation cost in yuan?So, I need to find the value of v in [60, 120] that minimizes y. Since y is a function of v, I can use calculus to find the minimum. Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality since the expression seems to be in a form that allows it.Let me try both approaches.First, let's consider using calculus. To find the minimum, I need to take the derivative of y with respect to v, set it equal to zero, and solve for v.Given y = 166*(0.02v + 200/v)Let me write it as:y = 166*(0.02v + 200v^{-1})Compute the derivative dy/dv:dy/dv = 166*(0.02 - 200v^{-2})Set dy/dv = 0:166*(0.02 - 200/v¬≤) = 0Since 166 is not zero, we can divide both sides by 166:0.02 - 200 / v¬≤ = 0So, 0.02 = 200 / v¬≤Multiply both sides by v¬≤:0.02v¬≤ = 200Divide both sides by 0.02:v¬≤ = 200 / 0.02 = 10,000Take the square root:v = sqrt(10,000) = 100So, v = 100 km/h is a critical point. Now, we need to check if this is a minimum. Since the function y is defined on a closed interval [60, 120], we can check the second derivative or evaluate the function at the critical point and endpoints.Let me compute the second derivative to confirm concavity.First derivative: dy/dv = 166*(0.02 - 200 / v¬≤)Second derivative: d¬≤y/dv¬≤ = 166*(0 + 400 / v¬≥) = 166*(400 / v¬≥)Since v is positive (speed can't be negative), the second derivative is positive, meaning the function is concave upward at v = 100, so it's a local minimum. Since it's the only critical point in the interval, it must be the global minimum.Alternatively, using AM-GM inequality:We have y = 166*(0.02v + 200 / v)Let me denote A = 0.02v and B = 200 / vThen, y = 166*(A + B)By AM-GM inequality, for positive numbers A and B, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean:(A + B)/2 ‚â• sqrt(AB)So, A + B ‚â• 2*sqrt(AB)Therefore, y = 166*(A + B) ‚â• 166*2*sqrt(AB)Compute AB:AB = 0.02v * (200 / v) = 0.02 * 200 = 4So, sqrt(AB) = sqrt(4) = 2Thus, y ‚â• 166*2*2 = 166*4 = 664Equality holds when A = B, i.e., 0.02v = 200 / vSolving for v:0.02v¬≤ = 200v¬≤ = 10,000v = 100 km/hSo, the minimum cost is 664 yuan when v = 100 km/h.Therefore, both calculus and AM-GM methods lead to the same conclusion.Just to be thorough, let me compute the cost at the endpoints as well, to ensure that 100 km/h indeed gives the minimum.Compute y at v = 60:y = 166*(0.02*60 + 200 / 60)Compute 0.02*60 = 1.2200 / 60 ‚âà 3.3333So, y ‚âà 166*(1.2 + 3.3333) ‚âà 166*(4.5333) ‚âà 166*4.5333 ‚âà Let me compute 166*4 = 664, 166*0.5333 ‚âà 166*(16/30) ‚âà 166*0.5333 ‚âà 88.444So, total y ‚âà 664 + 88.444 ‚âà 752.444 yuanAt v = 60, y ‚âà 752.44 yuanAt v = 120:y = 166*(0.02*120 + 200 / 120)0.02*120 = 2.4200 / 120 ‚âà 1.6667So, y ‚âà 166*(2.4 + 1.6667) ‚âà 166*(4.0667) ‚âà Let's compute 166*4 = 664, 166*0.0667 ‚âà 11.07So, total y ‚âà 664 + 11.07 ‚âà 675.07 yuanSo, at v = 120, y ‚âà 675.07 yuanComparing the three:At v = 60: ~752.44 yuanAt v = 100: 664 yuanAt v = 120: ~675.07 yuanSo, clearly, the minimum is at v = 100 km/h with y = 664 yuan.Therefore, the answer is that the car should travel at 100 km/h to minimize the total transportation cost, and the minimum cost is 664 yuan.**Final Answer**The minimum transportation cost is boxed{664} yuan when the car travels at boxed{100} kilometers per hour."},{"question":"The equation representing the relationship in the condition \\"a number that is 3 more than half of x is equal to twice y\\" is ____.","answer":"First, identify the components of the statement: \\"a number that is 3 more than half of ( x )\\" and \\"equal to twice ( y )\\".Next, translate \\"half of ( x )\\" into mathematical language: ( frac{1}{2}x ).Then, add 3 to this expression to represent \\"3 more than half of ( x )\\": ( frac{1}{2}x + 3 ).After that, translate \\"twice ( y )\\" into mathematical language: ( 2y ).Finally, set these two expressions equal to each other to represent the \\"is equal to\\" part of the condition: ( frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 2y ).Therefore, the equation representing the relationship in the condition is ( boxed{frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 2y} )."},{"question":"Define a sequence  {(n_k)_{kge 0}}  by  {n_{0 }= n_{1} = 1} , and  {n_{2k} = n_k + n_{k-1} }  and  {n_{2k+1} = n_k}  for  {k ge 1} .

The goal is to show that every positive rational number appears exactly once in the sequence ((q_k)).Okay, let's start by computing some terms of the sequence (n_k) to get a feel for how it behaves.Given (n_0 = n_1 = 1), let's compute (n_2):- (n_2 = n_{2*1} = n_1 + n_{0} = 1 + 1 = 2)Then (n_3):- (n_3 = n_{2*1 + 1} = n_1 = 1)Next, (n_4):- (n_4 = n_{2*2} = n_2 + n_{1} = 2 + 1 = 3)(n_5):- (n_5 = n_{2*2 + 1} = n_2 = 2)(n_6):- (n_6 = n_{2*3} = n_3 + n_{2} = 1 + 2 = 3)(n_7):- (n_7 = n_{2*3 + 1} = n_3 = 1)(n_8):- (n_8 = n_{2*4} = n_4 + n_{3} = 3 + 1 = 4)(n_9):- (n_9 = n_{2*4 + 1} = n_4 = 3)(n_{10}):- (n_{10} = n_{2*5} = n_5 + n_{4} = 2 + 3 = 5)(n_{11}):- (n_{11} = n_{2*5 + 1} = n_5 = 2)(n_{12}):- (n_{12} = n_{2*6} = n_6 + n_{5} = 3 + 2 = 5)(n_{13}):- (n_{13} = n_{2*6 + 1} = n_6 = 3)(n_{14}):- (n_{14} = n_{2*7} = n_7 + n_{6} = 1 + 3 = 4)(n_{15}):- (n_{15} = n_{2*7 + 1} = n_7 = 1)(n_{16}):- (n_{16} = n_{2*8} = n_8 + n_{7} = 4 + 1 = 5)Okay, so the sequence (n_k) up to (k=16) is:1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1, 5,...Now, let's compute the corresponding (q_k = frac{n_k}{n_{k-1}}):- (q_1 = frac{n_1}{n_0} = frac{1}{1} = 1)- (q_2 = frac{n_2}{n_1} = frac{2}{1} = 2)- (q_3 = frac{n_3}{n_2} = frac{1}{2})- (q_4 = frac{n_4}{n_3} = frac{3}{1} = 3)- (q_5 = frac{n_5}{n_4} = frac{2}{3})- (q_6 = frac{n_6}{n_5} = frac{3}{2})- (q_7 = frac{n_7}{n_6} = frac{1}{3})- (q_8 = frac{n_8}{n_7} = frac{4}{1} = 4)- (q_9 = frac{n_9}{n_8} = frac{3}{4})- (q_{10} = frac{n_{10}}{n_9} = frac{5}{3})- (q_{11} = frac{n_{11}}{n_{10}} = frac{2}{5})- (q_{12} = frac{n_{12}}{n_{11}} = frac{5}{2})- (q_{13} = frac{n_{13}}{n_{12}} = frac{3}{5})- (q_{14} = frac{n_{14}}{n_{13}} = frac{4}{3})- (q_{15} = frac{n_{15}}{n_{14}} = frac{1}{4})- (q_{16} = frac{n_{16}}{n_{15}} = frac{5}{1} = 5)So, the sequence (q_k) up to (k=16) is:1, 2, 1/2, 3, 2/3, 3/2, 1/3, 4, 3/4, 5/3, 2/5, 5/2, 3/5, 4/3, 1/4, 5,...Looking at this, I can see that both integers and fractions are appearing. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are all present, as well as fractions like 1/2, 2/3, 3/2, etc. It seems like the sequence is generating both positive integers and their reciprocals, as well as other fractions.But the problem states that every positive rational number appears exactly once. So, I need to show that for any positive rational number ( frac{a}{b} ), there exists exactly one ( k ) such that ( q_k = frac{a}{b} ).To approach this, maybe I can think about the properties of the sequence ( q_k ). From the recursive definitions, it seems that each term ( q_k ) is either greater than 1 or less than 1, depending on whether ( k ) is even or odd.Looking back at the definitions:- For even ( k = 2m ), ( q_{2m} = frac{n_{2m}}{n_{2m - 1}} = frac{n_m + n_{m - 1}}{n_{m - 1}} = 1 + frac{n_m}{n_{m - 1}} = 1 + q_m ). So, ( q_{2m} = 1 + q_m ).- For odd ( k = 2m + 1 ), ( q_{2m + 1} = frac{n_{2m + 1}}{n_{2m}} = frac{n_m}{n_m + n_{m - 1}} = frac{1}{1 + frac{n_{m - 1}}{n_m}} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{q_m}} ). So, ( q_{2m + 1} = frac{1}{1 + frac{1}{q_m}} ).This seems to suggest that each term is built from previous terms, either by adding 1 or taking the reciprocal of 1 plus the reciprocal of a previous term.This reminds me of the Farey sequence or the Stern's diatomic sequence, which are known to enumerate all positive rationals exactly once. Maybe this sequence is similar.In fact, the recursive definitions here look similar to those used in the Calkin-Wilf tree, which is known to list all positive rationals exactly once. The Calkin-Wilf tree is constructed by starting with 1/1, and then each node ( a/b ) has two children: ( a/(a + b) ) and ( (a + b)/b ). This tree enumerates all positive rationals exactly once.Comparing this to our sequence, let's see:- Starting with ( q_1 = 1 ), which is 1/1.- Then ( q_2 = 2 = 2/1 ), and ( q_3 = 1/2 ).- Next, ( q_4 = 3 = 3/1 ), ( q_5 = 2/3 ), ( q_6 = 3/2 ), ( q_7 = 1/3 ).- And so on.This seems to match the structure of the Calkin-Wilf tree, where each term generates two children: one greater than 1 and one less than 1.In the Calkin-Wilf tree, each positive rational appears exactly once, so if our sequence ( q_k ) corresponds to a breadth-first traversal of this tree, then it would indeed list every positive rational exactly once.Alternatively, if we consider the sequence as a breadth-first traversal, then each term is generated by the previous terms in a way that ensures all fractions are covered without repetition.To formalize this, perhaps we can use induction or some form of bijective proof.Let me try to think inductively.**Base Case:**For ( k = 1 ), ( q_1 = 1 ), which is the simplest positive rational number.**Inductive Step:**Assume that for all ( m < k ), the sequence ( q_m ) contains all positive rationals with numerator and denominator summing to less than or equal to some value, and each appears exactly once.Then, for ( k ), depending on whether it's even or odd, we generate a new rational number either by adding 1 to a previous term or taking the reciprocal of 1 plus the reciprocal of a previous term.This process ensures that we are systematically generating all possible positive rationals without repetition.Alternatively, considering the recursive definitions, we can see that each positive rational can be reached by a finite number of operations starting from 1, either adding 1 or taking the reciprocal of 1 plus the reciprocal.Since every positive rational can be expressed in terms of these operations, and the sequence is constructed to cover all such possibilities without overlap, it must contain every positive rational exactly once.Another approach is to consider the sequence as a traversal of the Calkin-Wilf tree, where each term corresponds to a node, and the traversal ensures that every node is visited exactly once.Therefore, combining these observations, it seems plausible that the sequence ( q_k ) indeed contains every positive rational number exactly once.However, to make this rigorous, I would need to formalize the argument, possibly by establishing a bijection between the sequence and the positive rationals, ensuring that every positive rational is generated exactly once through the recursive definitions.Perhaps using the properties of continued fractions or the structure of the Calkin-Wilf tree would help in constructing a formal proof.In summary, by examining the recursive definitions and comparing to known sequences that enumerate all positive rationals, it appears that the sequence ( q_k ) satisfies the required property. To fully prove it, a more detailed analysis or reference to established results about such sequences would be necessary."},{"question":"Given the polynomial q(x) = Ax^5 - Bx^3 + Cx - 2, when it is divided by x - 2, the remainder is -6. Find the remainder when q(x) is divided by x + 2.","answer":"Okay, so I have this polynomial ( q(x) = Ax^5 - Bx^3 + Cx - 2 ). The problem says that when it's divided by ( x - 2 ), the remainder is -6. I need to find the remainder when ( q(x) ) is divided by ( x + 2 ).Hmm, I remember something called the Remainder Theorem. Let me try to recall. The Remainder Theorem states that if you divide a polynomial ( q(x) ) by ( x - a ), the remainder is ( q(a) ). So, in this case, since we're dividing by ( x - 2 ), the remainder should be ( q(2) ). And they told us that this remainder is -6. So, I can write that as:[ q(2) = -6 ]Let me plug ( x = 2 ) into the polynomial:[ q(2) = A(2)^5 - B(2)^3 + C(2) - 2 ]Calculating each term:- ( 2^5 = 32 ), so the first term is ( 32A )- ( 2^3 = 8 ), so the second term is ( -8B )- ( 2 ) times ( C ) is ( 2C )- The constant term is ( -2 )Putting it all together:[ 32A - 8B + 2C - 2 = -6 ]Hmm, let me simplify this equation. I can add 2 to both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left:[ 32A - 8B + 2C = -4 ]Okay, so that's one equation involving A, B, and C. But I don't know the values of A, B, or C. The problem doesn't give me more information, so I must be missing something. Wait, maybe I don't need the exact values of A, B, and C. The question is asking for the remainder when ( q(x) ) is divided by ( x + 2 ). Using the Remainder Theorem again, that should be ( q(-2) ).Let me write that down:[ q(-2) = A(-2)^5 - B(-2)^3 + C(-2) - 2 ]Calculating each term:- ( (-2)^5 = -32 ), so the first term is ( -32A )- ( (-2)^3 = -8 ), so the second term is ( -B(-8) = 8B )- ( -2 ) times ( C ) is ( -2C )- The constant term is ( -2 )Putting it all together:[ q(-2) = -32A + 8B - 2C - 2 ]Hmm, I notice that this expression has similar terms to the equation I got from ( q(2) ). Let me write both equations side by side:From ( q(2) ):[ 32A - 8B + 2C = -4 ]From ( q(-2) ):[ -32A + 8B - 2C = ? ]Wait a second, if I factor out a negative sign from the second equation, it looks like the negative of the first equation. Let me see:If I take the equation from ( q(2) ):[ 32A - 8B + 2C = -4 ]and multiply both sides by -1, I get:[ -32A + 8B - 2C = 4 ]Which is exactly the coefficients of ( q(-2) ) except for the constant term. So, substituting back into ( q(-2) ):[ q(-2) = (-32A + 8B - 2C) - 2 ]But we know from above that ( -32A + 8B - 2C = 4 ), so:[ q(-2) = 4 - 2 = 2 ]So, the remainder when ( q(x) ) is divided by ( x + 2 ) is 2.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from ( q(2) = -6 ), I correctly substituted and simplified to get ( 32A - 8B + 2C = -4 ). Then, for ( q(-2) ), I correctly expanded each term and noticed that the coefficients are negatives of the first equation. Multiplying the first equation by -1 gives me the coefficients for ( q(-2) ), and then subtracting 2 gives me the final remainder. It all seems to check out.I think I got it right. The remainder is 2.**Final Answer**The remainder when ( q(x) ) is divided by ( x + 2 ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"If the complex number (a-i)(1+i) (where i is the imaginary unit, ainmathbb{R}) is a pure imaginary number, then a= ___.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If the complex number (a - i)(1 + i) is a pure imaginary number, then what is a? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that a complex number has a real part and an imaginary part. A pure imaginary number is one where the real part is zero. So, if (a - i)(1 + i) is pure imaginary, that means the real part of this product must be zero.Alright, let me multiply out (a - i)(1 + i) to see what I get. I'll use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for multiplying two binomials.So, expanding (a - i)(1 + i):First, multiply a by 1: that's a.Then, multiply a by i: that's ai.Next, multiply -i by 1: that's -i.Finally, multiply -i by i: that's -i¬≤.Putting it all together: a + ai - i - i¬≤.Now, I know that i¬≤ is equal to -1, so -i¬≤ is equal to 1. Let me substitute that in:a + ai - i + 1.Now, let's combine like terms. The real parts are a and 1, and the imaginary parts are ai and -i.So, the real part is (a + 1), and the imaginary part is (a - 1)i.Since the complex number is supposed to be pure imaginary, the real part must be zero. That means:a + 1 = 0.Solving for a, I subtract 1 from both sides:a = -1.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I expanded the product correctly, right? (a - i)(1 + i) becomes a + ai - i - i¬≤. Then, since i¬≤ is -1, that becomes a + ai - i + 1. Combining real parts: a + 1, and imaginary parts: ai - i, which is (a - 1)i. Setting the real part to zero gives a + 1 = 0, so a = -1. Yeah, that seems right.Just to be thorough, let me plug a = -1 back into the original expression and see if it's indeed a pure imaginary number.Substituting a = -1 into (a - i)(1 + i):(-1 - i)(1 + i).Multiplying this out:-1*1 = -1,-1*i = -i,-i*1 = -i,-i*i = -i¬≤ = -(-1) = 1.Adding these together: -1 - i - i + 1.Combine like terms: (-1 + 1) + (-i - i) = 0 - 2i.So, the result is -2i, which is a pure imaginary number. Perfect, that checks out.I think I've got it. The value of a is -1.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{-1}."},{"question":"Using toothpicks of equal length, a rectangular grid is constructed. If the grid has a height of 15 toothpicks and a width of 12 toothpicks, how many toothpicks are required to build the grid?textrm{(A)} 387qquadtextrm{(B)} 340qquadtextrm{(C)} 400qquadtextrm{(D)} 410qquadtextrm{(E)} 430","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about constructing a rectangular grid using toothpicks. The grid has a height of 15 toothpicks and a width of 12 toothpicks. I need to figure out how many toothpicks are required to build this grid. The answer choices are A) 387, B) 340, C) 400, D) 410, and E) 430.Alright, let me start by visualizing what this grid might look like. If it's a rectangular grid, it's probably made up of horizontal and vertical toothpicks forming a series of squares or rectangles. The height is 15 toothpicks, which I assume means there are 15 toothpicks stacked vertically to make the height of the grid. Similarly, the width is 12 toothpicks, meaning there are 12 toothpicks placed horizontally to make the width.But wait, in a grid, the number of toothpicks isn't just the sum of the height and width because each row and column requires multiple toothpicks. Let me think about a smaller grid first to get the pattern.Suppose I have a grid that's 1x1. That would require 4 toothpicks: two horizontal and two vertical. But actually, for a 1x1 grid, it's just a single square, so it needs 4 toothpicks. For a 2x2 grid, how many toothpicks would that be? Well, each row would have 3 horizontal toothpicks, and there are 3 rows, so 3x3=9 horizontal toothpicks. Similarly, each column would have 3 vertical toothpicks, and there are 3 columns, so another 9 vertical toothpicks. Wait, that would be 18 toothpicks, but that seems too many because a 2x2 grid should have 12 toothpicks: 4 squares, each needing 4 toothpicks, but shared between them. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.Let me try a different way. For a grid with m rows and n columns, the number of horizontal toothpicks would be (m+1) times n, because each row has n toothpicks and there are m+1 horizontal lines. Similarly, the number of vertical toothpicks would be (n+1) times m, because each column has m toothpicks and there are n+1 vertical lines. So the total number of toothpicks would be (m+1)*n + (n+1)*m.Let me test this formula with a 1x1 grid. m=1, n=1. So (1+1)*1 + (1+1)*1 = 2 + 2 = 4 toothpicks. That works. For a 2x2 grid, m=2, n=2. (2+1)*2 + (2+1)*2 = 6 + 6 = 12 toothpicks. That also works. Okay, so this formula seems correct.Now, applying this to the problem. The grid has a height of 15 toothpicks and a width of 12 toothpicks. I think this means that the grid has 15 rows and 12 columns. So m=15, n=12.Using the formula, the number of horizontal toothpicks would be (15+1)*12 = 16*12. Let me calculate that: 16*12 is 192. The number of vertical toothpicks would be (12+1)*15 = 13*15. Calculating that: 13*15 is 195. So the total number of toothpicks is 192 + 195.Adding those together: 192 + 195. Let me do the addition step by step. 192 + 195. 192 + 100 is 292, plus 90 is 382, plus 5 is 387. So the total number of toothpicks required is 387.Looking back at the answer choices, A is 387, so that must be the correct answer.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. The height is 15 toothpicks, which I took as the number of rows, and the width is 12 toothpicks, which I took as the number of columns. Is that correct?Let me think again. If the grid has a height of 15 toothpicks, that would mean that each vertical line is 15 toothpicks long, right? So the number of vertical toothpicks per column is 15. Similarly, the width is 12 toothpicks, meaning each horizontal line is 12 toothpicks long, so the number of horizontal toothpicks per row is 12.But in a grid, the number of vertical lines is one more than the number of columns, and the number of horizontal lines is one more than the number of rows. Wait, no, actually, if the grid has m rows, there are m+1 horizontal lines, and if it has n columns, there are n+1 vertical lines.Wait, maybe I got that reversed. Let me clarify. If I have a grid with m rows, that means there are m horizontal segments between the rows, but actually, the number of horizontal lines would be m+1 because you need a line at the top and bottom as well. Similarly, for n columns, there are n+1 vertical lines.But in this problem, the height is given as 15 toothpicks, which probably refers to the number of toothpicks in each vertical line. So if each vertical line is 15 toothpicks long, that means the grid has 15 units of height, which would correspond to 15 rows. Similarly, the width is 12 toothpicks, meaning each horizontal line is 12 toothpicks long, corresponding to 12 columns.So, the number of vertical lines would be 12 + 1 = 13, each 15 toothpicks long, so 13 * 15 = 195 vertical toothpicks. The number of horizontal lines would be 15 + 1 = 16, each 12 toothpicks long, so 16 * 12 = 192 horizontal toothpicks. Adding them together, 195 + 192 = 387.Yes, that seems consistent. So I think my initial approach was correct, and the answer is 387, which is option A."},{"question":"Willie came back from Europe with 70 euros.

To find out what fraction of the official exchange rate the airport used, I'll divide the amount he received by the amount he would have received at the official rate:10 dollars √∑ 14 dollars = 10/14.Finally, I'll simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:10/14 √∑ 2/2 = 5/7.Therefore, the airport gave Willie 5/7 of the official exchange rate."},{"question":"Kevin has a shoebox filled with toads.

The options are A: (-1, -2), B: (-1, 2), C: (1, -2), and D: (1, 2). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the form a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. So, if I can express z in this form, then the coordinates will just be (a, b). The equation given is zi = 2 - i. I need to solve for z. To do that, I can divide both sides by i. So, z equals (2 - i) divided by i. But dividing by i can be a bit tricky, so maybe I should multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of i to simplify it. Wait, the complex conjugate of i is -i, right? Because the complex conjugate changes the sign of the imaginary part.So, if I multiply both the numerator and denominator by -i, that should help. Let me write that out:z = (2 - i) / iMultiply numerator and denominator by -i:z = [(2 - i)(-i)] / [i * (-i)]Let me compute the numerator first: (2 - i)(-i). Distribute the multiplication:2*(-i) + (-i)*(-i) = -2i + i¬≤Wait, i squared is -1, so this becomes -2i + (-1) = -1 - 2i.Now, the denominator: i * (-i) = -i¬≤. Again, i squared is -1, so this is -(-1) = 1.So, putting it all together, z = (-1 - 2i) / 1 = -1 - 2i.Therefore, the complex number z is -1 - 2i, which corresponds to the point (-1, -2) in the complex plane. So, looking at the options, that's option A.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from zi = 2 - i, solving for z by dividing both sides by i. Then, I multiplied numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize the denominator. The numerator became (2 - i)(-i) = -2i + i¬≤ = -2i -1, which is -1 - 2i. The denominator was i*(-i) = -i¬≤ = 1. So, yes, z is indeed -1 - 2i, which is (-1, -2). So, I think my answer is correct.Alternatively, I remember that multiplying by i is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation in the complex plane. So, if zi = 2 - i, then z is the result of rotating 2 - i by -90 degrees, which would flip the coordinates and change signs accordingly. Let me see: 2 - i is the point (2, -1). Rotating this by -90 degrees would transform (x, y) to (y, -x), so (2, -1) becomes (-1, -2). Yep, that's the same result. So, that confirms it.I think I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Given that the radius of a sphere is 10cm, and the area of a cross-sectional circle is 36pi cm^{2}, find the distance between the center of the sphere and the center of the circumference of the cross-sectional circle.","answer":"First, I need to determine the radius of the cross-sectional circle. The area of the cross-sectional circle is given as (36pi , text{cm}^2).

The sphere has a radius of (10, text{cm}), and the cross-sectional circle has a radius of (6, text{cm}). By applying the theorem, I can calculate the distance (d) as (sqrt{10^2 - 6^2}).Finally, I'll compute the numerical value of (d) to find the exact distance."},{"question":"Define a new operation * such that a * b = a - frac{a}{b}. What is the value of 8 * 4?","answer":"Okay, so I have this math problem here that defines a new operation called *. It says that for any two numbers a and b, a * b equals a minus a divided by b. And the question is asking me to find the value of 8 * 4 using this new operation. Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what this * operation really means. It's not the usual multiplication or anything like that; it's a custom operation defined specifically for this problem. So, I can't assume it follows the same rules as regular multiplication. Instead, I have to use the definition provided.The definition is a * b = a - (a / b). So, whenever I see a * b, I should replace it with a minus a divided by b. That makes sense. So, for any two numbers, I take the first number, subtract from it the result of dividing the first number by the second number.Now, applying this to 8 * 4. Let's substitute a with 8 and b with 4 in the formula. So, it becomes 8 - (8 / 4). Okay, let's compute that step by step.First, I'll calculate the division part: 8 divided by 4. That's straightforward. 8 divided by 4 is 2. So, now the expression simplifies to 8 minus 2. Subtracting 2 from 8 gives me 6. So, according to this operation, 8 * 4 equals 6. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when dealing with new operations, it's easy to mix up the order or misapply the formula. Starting again: a * b = a - (a / b). So, plugging in a = 8 and b = 4, we have 8 - (8 / 4). 8 divided by 4 is indeed 2, and 8 minus 2 is 6. Yep, that seems correct.I wonder if there's another way to look at this operation to better understand it. Maybe I can factor out the a from the expression. Let's see: a * b = a - (a / b) can be rewritten as a(1 - 1/b). That's interesting because it shows that the operation is scaling a by the factor (1 - 1/b). So, for 8 * 4, it's 8 times (1 - 1/4). Calculating inside the parentheses first: 1 - 1/4 is 3/4. Then, multiplying 8 by 3/4 gives me 6. That's the same result as before. This alternative method confirms that the answer is indeed 6.Is there any other way to verify this? Maybe by plugging in different numbers to see if the operation behaves as expected. For example, let's try 10 * 5. According to the definition, that should be 10 - (10 / 5) = 10 - 2 = 8. Alternatively, using the factored form: 10 * (1 - 1/5) = 10 * (4/5) = 8. That works too.Another example: 6 * 3. Using the original formula: 6 - (6 / 3) = 6 - 2 = 4. Using the factored form: 6 * (1 - 1/3) = 6 * (2/3) = 4. Consistent again. This makes me more confident that my understanding of the operation is correct and that applying it to 8 * 4 gives the right answer, which is 6.I also want to think about the properties of this operation. Is it commutative? That is, does a * b equal b * a? Let's test that with our previous examples. Take 8 * 4 = 6 and 4 * 8. According to the definition, 4 * 8 would be 4 - (4 / 8) = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5. Clearly, 6 is not equal to 3.5, so the operation is not commutative. That's an important property to note, even though it's not directly relevant to solving this problem.What about associativity? Is (a * b) * c equal to a * (b * c)? Let's see. Maybe with simple numbers. Let's take a = 2, b = 2, c = 2.First, compute (2 * 2) * 2. 2 * 2 is 2 - (2 / 2) = 2 - 1 = 1. Then, 1 * 2 is 1 - (1 / 2) = 0.5. Now, compute 2 * (2 * 2). 2 * 2 is 1, as before. Then, 2 * 1 is 2 - (2 / 1) = 2 - 2 = 0. So, (2 * 2) * 2 = 0.5 and 2 * (2 * 2) = 0. They are not equal, so the operation is not associative either.Understanding these properties helps me see how this operation behaves in different scenarios, which is useful for a deeper grasp of the concept, even though it's not necessary for solving the specific problem at hand.Going back to the problem, I think I've thoroughly checked my work. I applied the operation as defined, used an alternative method to verify the result, and even explored some properties of the operation to ensure my understanding was solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 8 * 4 equals 6 according to the given operation."},{"question":"If sqrt[3]{0.3}approx 0.6694 and sqrt[3]{3}approx 1.442, then sqrt[3]{300}approx____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If the cube root of 0.3 is approximately 0.6694 and the cube root of 3 is approximately 1.442, then I need to find the cube root of 300. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that cube roots have some properties that can help simplify calculations. One of the key properties is that the cube root of a product is equal to the product of the cube roots. In other words, ‚àõ(a * b) = ‚àõa * ‚àõb. Maybe I can use this property to break down 300 into factors that I already know the cube roots of.Looking at 300, I notice that it's 3 multiplied by 100. So, 300 = 3 * 100. That seems useful because I know the cube root of 3 is given as approximately 1.442. But what about 100? I don't have the cube root of 100 directly, but maybe I can express 100 in terms of another number whose cube root I know or can calculate.Wait, 100 is 10 squared, right? So, 100 = 10^2. Therefore, 300 = 3 * 10^2. Now, using the property of cube roots, I can write ‚àõ(300) as ‚àõ(3 * 10^2). This can be separated into ‚àõ3 * ‚àõ(10^2).But I still need to find ‚àõ(10^2). I know that ‚àõ(10^3) is 10 because 10 cubed is 1000. But 10^2 is 100, which is less than 1000. Maybe I can relate ‚àõ(10^2) to ‚àõ1000 somehow.Alternatively, I recall that 1000 is 10^3, so ‚àõ1000 = 10. If I can express 300 in terms of 1000, that might help. Let me see: 300 is 0.3 times 1000 because 0.3 * 1000 = 300. So, 300 = 0.3 * 1000.Now, using the cube root property again, ‚àõ(300) = ‚àõ(0.3 * 1000) = ‚àõ0.3 * ‚àõ1000. I know that ‚àõ1000 is 10, and ‚àõ0.3 is given as approximately 0.6694. So, multiplying these together should give me the cube root of 300.Let me do that calculation: 0.6694 * 10 = 6.694. So, ‚àõ300 is approximately 6.694.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by expressing 300 as 0.3 * 1000, which seems correct because 0.3 * 1000 is indeed 300. Then, I used the cube root property to separate it into ‚àõ0.3 * ‚àõ1000. Since ‚àõ1000 is 10, and ‚àõ0.3 is given as 0.6694, multiplying those gives 6.694. That seems right.Just to be thorough, maybe I can check this result another way. I know that ‚àõ300 is the same as ‚àõ(3 * 100). I already know ‚àõ3 is approximately 1.442, but I don't know ‚àõ100 directly. However, I can express 100 as 10^2, so ‚àõ100 = ‚àõ(10^2). I also know that ‚àõ(10^3) = 10, so ‚àõ(10^2) should be less than 10. Maybe I can approximate it.Let me think: 10^2 is 100, and 10^3 is 1000. The cube root of 100 would be a number x such that x^3 = 100. I know that 4^3 is 64 and 5^3 is 125, so ‚àõ100 is somewhere between 4 and 5. Maybe around 4.64? Let me check: 4.64^3 is approximately 4.64 * 4.64 * 4.64. First, 4.64 * 4.64 is about 21.53, and then 21.53 * 4.64 is roughly 100. So, ‚àõ100 ‚âà 4.64.Now, if I use this approximation, ‚àõ300 = ‚àõ3 * ‚àõ100 ‚âà 1.442 * 4.64. Let me calculate that: 1.442 * 4.64. 1 * 4.64 is 4.64, 0.4 * 4.64 is 1.856, 0.04 * 4.64 is 0.1856, and 0.002 * 4.64 is 0.00928. Adding those together: 4.64 + 1.856 = 6.496, plus 0.1856 is 6.6816, plus 0.00928 is approximately 6.69088. That's very close to the previous result of 6.694. So, both methods give me similar answers, which is reassuring.Therefore, I'm confident that the cube root of 300 is approximately 6.694."},{"question":"What is the remainder when 2,356,912 is divided by 8?","answer":"To find the remainder when 2,356,912 is divided by 8, I can use the divisibility rule for 8, which states that if the last three digits of a number are divisible by 8, then the entire number is divisible by 8.First, I'll identify the last three digits of 2,356,912, which are 912.Next, I'll check if 912 is divisible by 8 by performing the division:912 √∑ 8 = 114Since 912 divided by 8 equals 114 with no remainder, this means that 912 is divisible by 8.Therefore, the entire number 2,356,912 is also divisible by 8, and the remainder when it is divided by 8 is 0."},{"question":"For the nonzero numbers a, b, and c, define text{K}(a,b,c) = frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{c} + frac{c}{a} + frac{a}{b} cdot frac{b}{c} cdot frac{c}{a}.

Every triangle in T is an inscribed triangle in the circle Gamma.2. No two triangles in T have common internal points.Find all positive real numbers t such that for every positive integer n, there exists a good set consisting of n triangles, and the perimeter of each triangle is greater than t.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a circle with radius 1, and I need to find all positive real numbers t such that for every positive integer n, there exists a \\"good\\" set of n triangles. Each triangle must be inscribed in the circle, and no two triangles can have common internal points. Also, each triangle must have a perimeter greater than t.First, I need to understand what a \\"good\\" set of triangles means. It says that every triangle is inscribed in the circle, which means all the vertices of each triangle lie on the circumference of the circle. The second condition is that no two triangles share any internal points. So, their interiors don't overlap, but they can share edges or vertices, I guess.Now, the goal is to find all t such that for any n, I can have n triangles meeting these conditions, each with a perimeter greater than t. So, t is like a lower bound on the perimeter of each triangle, and I need this bound to work for any number of triangles n.I think the first step is to figure out what the maximum and minimum possible perimeters of inscribed triangles can be. Since the circle has radius 1, the diameter is 2. The largest possible perimeter would be for an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle. Each side would be 2 * sin(60¬∞) = ‚àö3, so the perimeter would be 3‚àö3 ‚âà 5.196.But wait, the problem is about the minimum perimeter. So, what's the smallest possible perimeter of an inscribed triangle? If I make one side very small, approaching zero, then the other two sides would approach the diameter, which is 2. So, the perimeter would approach 2 + 2 = 4. So, the perimeter can get as small as just over 4.But in our case, we need each triangle to have a perimeter greater than t. So, if t is too large, say t > 4, then maybe we can't have too many triangles because each triangle would need to be large, and they can't overlap. But if t is less than or equal to 4, maybe we can fit as many triangles as we want.Wait, but the problem says for every positive integer n, there exists a good set of n triangles. So, even as n grows, we need to be able to fit n triangles without overlapping, each with perimeter greater than t.So, if t is too large, say t = 5, then each triangle would need to have a perimeter greater than 5. But the maximum perimeter is about 5.196, so we can't have too many triangles because each would need to be almost the largest possible triangle, and they can't overlap. So, maybe t can't be too large.But if t is 4, then each triangle just needs to have a perimeter greater than 4. Since the perimeter can approach 4, maybe we can fit infinitely many triangles, each with perimeter just over 4, arranged in a way that they don't overlap.Wait, but how? If I have n triangles, each with perimeter just over 4, how do I arrange them without overlapping? Maybe by making them very \\"skinny\\" and arranging them around the circle.Let me think about this. If I have a triangle inscribed in the circle with one very small side, then the other two sides are almost the diameter. So, if I make n such triangles, each with a small side near a different point on the circle, maybe I can arrange them so that their small sides are near different points, and their large sides don't overlap.But wait, if I have n triangles, each with a small side near a different point, then their large sides would span across the circle. If n is large, say n approaching infinity, then the small sides would be densely covering the circle, but their large sides would overlap.Hmm, maybe that's not the way. Maybe I need to arrange the triangles in such a way that their large sides are not overlapping. Maybe by placing their vertices in a specific pattern.Alternatively, maybe I can use a triangulation of the circle. If I divide the circle into n equal arcs, and then connect each arc's endpoints to a common point, forming n triangles. Each triangle would have two sides equal to the radius, which is 1, and the third side would be the chord corresponding to the arc.Wait, but in that case, the perimeter of each triangle would be 1 + 1 + chord length. The chord length for an arc of angle Œ∏ is 2*sin(Œ∏/2). If I divide the circle into n equal arcs, each arc has angle 2œÄ/n, so chord length is 2*sin(œÄ/n). As n increases, sin(œÄ/n) ‚âà œÄ/n, so chord length ‚âà 2œÄ/n. Therefore, the perimeter of each triangle is approximately 2 + 2œÄ/n.As n increases, the perimeter approaches 2. But we need the perimeter to be greater than t. So, if t is less than 2, this method works, but if t is greater than 2, this method doesn't suffice because for large n, the perimeter becomes less than t.But wait, in this case, the triangles are all sharing a common vertex, so they don't have overlapping interiors. So, maybe this is a way to have n triangles with perimeters approaching 2 as n increases. But the problem requires each triangle to have a perimeter greater than t, and we need this to hold for any n.So, if t is greater than 2, then for large enough n, the perimeter would be less than t, which violates the condition. Therefore, t cannot be greater than 2.But earlier, I thought that the perimeter can approach 4, so maybe t can be up to 4. But this method only gives perimeters approaching 2. So, maybe there's a better way to arrange the triangles so that their perimeters are larger.Wait, maybe instead of having all triangles share a common vertex, I can arrange them differently. For example, if I have n triangles, each with two vertices close together and the third vertex opposite, then each triangle would have two sides almost equal to the diameter, which is 2, and one very small side. So, the perimeter would be almost 4.If I arrange these triangles such that their small sides are near different points on the circle, then their large sides would span across the circle, but since their small sides are near different points, their large sides might not overlap.But wait, if I have n such triangles, each with a small side near a different point, then their large sides would span across the circle, potentially overlapping with each other. So, maybe that's not possible.Alternatively, maybe I can arrange the triangles in a way that their large sides are all on one side of the circle, but then they would overlap.Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think about the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles with a given perimeter.Wait, another approach: the area of the circle is œÄ, and each triangle must have a certain area. If each triangle has a perimeter greater than t, then their areas are bounded below. So, the total area of n triangles would be at least n times the minimum area for a triangle with perimeter t.But the total area of the circle is œÄ, so n times the minimum area must be less than or equal to œÄ. Therefore, n is bounded by œÄ divided by the minimum area. So, if t is too large, the minimum area per triangle is too large, and n cannot be arbitrary.Therefore, t cannot be too large, otherwise, we cannot have arbitrarily many triangles.So, to find the maximum t such that for any n, we can have n triangles with perimeter greater than t, we need to find the supremum of t such that the total area of n triangles with perimeter t is less than œÄ.But I'm not sure how to compute the minimum area for a triangle with a given perimeter inscribed in a circle of radius 1.Wait, maybe I can use some inequalities. For a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius R, the perimeter is related to the angles subtended by the sides at the center.Let me recall that for a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius R, the sides are given by 2R sin(Œ±), 2R sin(Œ≤), 2R sin(Œ≥), where Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ are the angles subtended by the sides at the center.Since R = 1, the sides are 2 sin Œ±, 2 sin Œ≤, 2 sin Œ≥, and the perimeter is 2(sin Œ± + sin Œ≤ + sin Œ≥).We need to maximize the perimeter, but in our case, we need to find the minimum perimeter such that we can have n triangles with perimeters above that.Wait, maybe I should think about the minimal perimeter triangle. The minimal perimeter occurs when the triangle is degenerate, but since it's inscribed, the minimal perimeter is when two points coincide, but that would make the perimeter approach 4, as I thought earlier.Wait, actually, if two points coincide, the triangle becomes a line segment, but since it's inscribed, the third point would be on the opposite side, making the perimeter approach 4.So, the minimal perimeter is 4, approached as the triangle becomes very \\"flat\\".Therefore, if t is less than or equal to 4, then for any n, we can have n triangles each with perimeter greater than t, arranged in a way that they don't overlap.But how? If t is 4, then each triangle must have a perimeter just over 4. So, each triangle is almost degenerate, with two sides almost equal to 2 (the diameter) and one side very small.If I arrange these triangles such that each has a very small side near a different point on the circle, then their large sides (almost 2) would span across the circle, but since their small sides are near different points, their large sides might not overlap.Wait, but if I have n such triangles, each with a small side near a different point, then their large sides would be chords spanning across the circle, potentially overlapping with each other.Hmm, maybe not. If I place the small sides near equally spaced points on the circle, then their large sides would be chords connecting those points to the opposite side, but since they are equally spaced, their large sides would not overlap.Wait, let me visualize this. Imagine the circle divided into n equal arcs, each with a small side near each division. Then, each triangle would have a small side near each division and two large sides connecting to the opposite side. But since the divisions are equally spaced, the large sides would be chords connecting each division to the point diametrically opposite, but since the circle is divided into n equal parts, the opposite point might not be exactly opposite unless n is even.Wait, if n is even, then each division has a diametrically opposite point. If n is odd, then the opposite point is not exactly a division point, but close to one.But in any case, if I arrange the triangles so that each has a small side near a division point and two large sides connecting to the opposite side, then their large sides would not overlap because they are all going to different opposite points.Wait, but actually, if I have n triangles, each with a small side near a different division point, then their large sides would all be going to the same opposite side, potentially overlapping.Wait, no, because each triangle's large sides are going to different points. If the small sides are near different points, then their large sides would be going to different opposite points, so they wouldn't overlap.Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose n = 3. I divide the circle into 3 equal arcs, each 120 degrees apart. Then, for each arc, I place a small side near each division point, and connect it to the point diametrically opposite, which would be 60 degrees away from the division point. Wait, no, diametrically opposite would be 180 degrees away.But if the division points are 120 degrees apart, then the diametrically opposite point of each division point is not a division point, but somewhere in between.So, for each division point, the diametrically opposite point is 180 degrees away, which is not a division point. So, each triangle would have a small side near a division point, and two large sides connecting to the opposite side, which is not a division point.Therefore, the large sides of the triangles would not overlap because they are connecting to different points.Wait, but actually, if I have n triangles, each with a small side near a division point, and their large sides connecting to the opposite side, then the large sides would all be going to different points, so they wouldn't overlap.Therefore, in this way, I can arrange n triangles, each with a perimeter just over 4, without overlapping interiors.Therefore, t can be up to 4.But earlier, I thought that if t is greater than 4, then it's impossible because the perimeter can't be more than 4 for infinitely many triangles. But actually, the perimeter can be up to about 5.196, but if t is greater than 4, say t = 5, then we can't have infinitely many triangles each with perimeter greater than 5 because the total area would exceed the circle's area.Wait, let me think about that again. If each triangle has a perimeter greater than t, then their areas are bounded below. The area of a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1 can be expressed in terms of its sides using Heron's formula, but it's complicated.Alternatively, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle inscribed in a circle: (abc)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides, and R is the radius. Since R = 1, the area is (abc)/4.But if the perimeter is fixed, the area is maximized when the triangle is equilateral. So, for a given perimeter, the maximum area is achieved by the equilateral triangle.But in our case, we need the minimum area for a given perimeter. So, for a given perimeter, the minimal area occurs when the triangle is as \\"flat\\" as possible, i.e., when one side is very small, making the triangle almost degenerate.In that case, the area approaches zero, but the perimeter approaches 4.Wait, so if t is 4, then each triangle can have an area approaching zero, so we can fit infinitely many such triangles without exceeding the circle's area.But if t is greater than 4, say t = 4 + Œµ for some Œµ > 0, then each triangle must have a perimeter greater than 4 + Œµ, which implies that their areas are bounded below by some positive number.Therefore, the total area of n such triangles would be at least n times that positive number, which would exceed the circle's area œÄ for sufficiently large n. Therefore, t cannot be greater than 4.Therefore, the maximum t is 4.So, putting it all together, the set of positive real numbers t is all t such that t ‚â§ 4. Therefore, t can be any positive real number up to 4.But wait, the problem says \\"positive real numbers t such that for every positive integer n, there exists a good set consisting of n triangles, and the perimeter of each triangle is greater than t.\\"So, t must be less than or equal to 4, because for t > 4, it's impossible to have infinitely many triangles each with perimeter greater than t without overlapping, due to the area constraint.Therefore, the answer is all positive real numbers t with t ‚â§ 4.But wait, the problem says \\"positive real numbers t\\", so t must be greater than 0. So, the set is (0, 4].But let me double-check. If t is 4, can we have n triangles each with perimeter greater than 4? Yes, because we can make each triangle have a perimeter just over 4 by making them almost degenerate, and arrange them around the circle without overlapping.If t is less than 4, say t = 3, then it's even easier because we can have triangles with larger perimeters.Therefore, the set of all positive real numbers t is (0, 4].So, the final answer is that all positive real numbers t with t ‚â§ 4 satisfy the condition. Therefore, t can be any real number in the interval (0, 4].**Final Answer**The set of all positive real numbers ( t ) is (boxed{(0, 4]})."},{"question":"A scale of certain length is divided into 5 equal parts.

The inequality given is f(cos2x + sinx) + f(sinx - a) ‚â§ 0 for any x in R. I need to find the maximum value of a. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, since f(x) is an odd function, that means f(-x) = -f(x). Also, it's decreasing, so if I have two points where one is larger than the other, the function value at the larger point will be smaller. So, if x1 < x2, then f(x1) > f(x2). That might come in handy.Looking at the inequality: f(cos2x + sinx) + f(sinx - a) ‚â§ 0. Maybe I can manipulate this using the properties of f(x). Since f is odd, f(sinx - a) can be written as -f(a - sinx). So, substituting that in, the inequality becomes f(cos2x + sinx) - f(a - sinx) ‚â§ 0. Which simplifies to f(cos2x + sinx) ‚â§ f(a - sinx).Now, since f is decreasing, the inequality f(u) ‚â§ f(v) implies that u ‚â• v. So, applying that here, cos2x + sinx ‚â• a - sinx. Let me write that down: cos2x + sinx ‚â• a - sinx.Simplifying that, I can bring the sinx terms together: cos2x + sinx + sinx ‚â• a. So, cos2x + 2sinx ‚â• a. Therefore, the inequality reduces to cos2x + 2sinx ‚â• a for all x in R. So, to find the maximum value of a such that this holds for all x, I need to find the minimum value of cos2x + 2sinx over all x, because a has to be less than or equal to this minimum.Alright, so now I need to find the minimum of the function g(x) = cos2x + 2sinx. Let me think about how to do that. Maybe I can express cos2x in terms of sinx to make it a single trigonometric function. I remember that cos2x can be written as 1 - 2sin¬≤x. So, substituting that in, g(x) becomes 1 - 2sin¬≤x + 2sinx.So, g(x) = -2sin¬≤x + 2sinx + 1. That's a quadratic in terms of sinx. Let me denote y = sinx, so g(y) = -2y¬≤ + 2y + 1. Now, since y = sinx, the domain of y is [-1, 1]. So, I need to find the minimum of the quadratic function g(y) = -2y¬≤ + 2y + 1 over y ‚àà [-1, 1].Quadratic functions have their extrema either at the vertex or at the endpoints of the interval. The vertex of a quadratic ay¬≤ + by + c is at y = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -2, b = 2, so the vertex is at y = -2/(2*(-2)) = -2/(-4) = 0.5. So, the vertex is at y = 0.5, which is within our interval [-1, 1].To find the minimum, we need to evaluate g(y) at the endpoints and at the vertex. Let's compute:1. At y = -1:g(-1) = -2*(-1)¬≤ + 2*(-1) + 1 = -2*(1) - 2 + 1 = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3.2. At y = 0.5:g(0.5) = -2*(0.5)¬≤ + 2*(0.5) + 1 = -2*(0.25) + 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1 + 1 = 1.5.3. At y = 1:g(1) = -2*(1)¬≤ + 2*(1) + 1 = -2 + 2 + 1 = 1.So, the function g(y) reaches its minimum at y = -1, where g(-1) = -3, and its maximum at y = 0.5, where g(0.5) = 1.5. Therefore, the minimum value of g(x) = cos2x + 2sinx is -3.Since we have cos2x + 2sinx ‚â• a for all x, and the minimum of the left side is -3, the maximum value of a that satisfies this inequality is a = -3. If a were any larger than -3, say -2, then when cos2x + 2sinx = -3, the inequality would become -3 ‚â• -2, which is false. So, a cannot be larger than -3.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the steps:1. Started with the inequality f(cos2x + sinx) + f(sinx - a) ‚â§ 0.2. Since f is odd, f(sinx - a) = -f(a - sinx).3. So, the inequality becomes f(cos2x + sinx) ‚â§ f(a - sinx).4. Since f is decreasing, cos2x + sinx ‚â• a - sinx.5. Simplified to cos2x + 2sinx ‚â• a.6. Expressed cos2x as 1 - 2sin¬≤x, leading to g(y) = -2y¬≤ + 2y + 1.7. Found the minimum of g(y) over y ‚àà [-1,1], which is -3 at y = -1.Everything seems to check out. So, the maximum value of a is indeed -3.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( a ) is (boxed{-3})."},{"question":"Candy sales from the Boosters Club from January through April are shown.

Let me try to understand the problem step by step.First, we have a set ( A = {1, 2, ldots, n} ). Then, ( B_n^m ) is defined as the set of all m-tuples ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m) ) where each ( a_i ) is in ( A ), and these tuples satisfy two conditions:1. The absolute difference between consecutive elements is not equal to ( n - 1 ). So, ( |a_i - a_{i+1}| neq n - 1 ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, m - 1 ).2. Among the elements ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m ), at least three are distinct. This condition only applies when ( m geq 3 ).Alright, so my goal is to count the number of such tuples in ( B_n^m ) and specifically for ( n = 6 ) and ( m = 3 ).Let me start by understanding the first condition. The absolute difference between consecutive elements should not be ( n - 1 ). For example, if ( n = 6 ), then ( n - 1 = 5 ). So, in this case, consecutive elements cannot differ by 5. That means, in the tuple, we cannot have a transition from 1 to 6 or from 6 to 1 because ( |1 - 6| = 5 ).The second condition is that at least three elements in the tuple must be distinct. So, for ( m = 3 ), this means that all three elements can't be the same, and they can't just have two different elements alternating or something like that. There must be at least three distinct numbers in the tuple.Hmm, okay. So, to find the number of elements in ( B_n^m ), I need to consider all possible m-tuples, subtract those that violate the first condition, and then subtract those that don't meet the second condition.Wait, actually, it's a bit more involved. Maybe I should model this as a recurrence relation problem because the condition on consecutive elements suggests that each step depends on the previous one.Let me think about how to model the number of valid sequences. Let's denote ( S_m ) as the number of sequences of length ( m ) that satisfy the first condition. Then, to get ( |B_n^m| ), I need to subtract the sequences that don't satisfy the second condition from ( S_m ).So, first, let's focus on calculating ( S_m ). To do this, I can think of it as a state machine where each state is an element of ( A ), and transitions between states are allowed except when the difference is ( n - 1 ).Let me define ( x_m ) as the number of sequences of length ( m ) ending with 1, ( y_m ) as the number ending with 2, 3, ..., ( n-1 ), and ( z_m ) as the number ending with ( n ). Then, the total number of sequences is ( S_m = x_m + y_m + z_m ).Now, let's find the recurrence relations for ( x_{m+1} ), ( y_{m+1} ), and ( z_{m+1} ).- To end with 1 at position ( m+1 ), the previous element at position ( m ) can be either 1 or any of the middle elements (2 to ( n-1 )), but not ( n ) because ( |1 - n| = n - 1 ), which is not allowed. So, ( x_{m+1} = x_m + y_m ).- Similarly, to end with ( n ) at position ( m+1 ), the previous element can be either ( n ) or any of the middle elements, but not 1. So, ( z_{m+1} = y_m + z_m ).- For the middle elements (2 to ( n-1 )), the previous element can be any element except the one that would make the difference ( n - 1 ). Since each middle element is neither 1 nor ( n ), the previous element can be any of the ( n ) elements except the one that is ( n - 1 ) away. But wait, for a middle element ( k ), the forbidden previous element is ( k + (n - 1) ) or ( k - (n - 1) ), but since ( k ) is between 2 and ( n-1 ), ( k + (n - 1) ) would be greater than ( n ), which is not in ( A ), and ( k - (n - 1) ) would be less than 1, which is also not in ( A ). So, actually, for middle elements, there are no forbidden previous elements because ( |k - a_{m}| neq n - 1 ) is automatically satisfied as long as ( a_{m} ) is in ( A ). Wait, that doesn't seem right.Wait, no. If ( k ) is a middle element, say 2, then ( |2 - a_{m}| neq n - 1 ). So, ( a_{m} ) cannot be ( 2 + (n - 1) ) or ( 2 - (n - 1) ). But ( 2 + (n - 1) = n + 1 ), which is outside of ( A ), and ( 2 - (n - 1) = 3 - n ), which is also outside of ( A ). So, actually, for middle elements, there are no forbidden previous elements because the forbidden ones are outside the set ( A ). Therefore, the number of sequences ending with a middle element at position ( m+1 ) is equal to the total number of sequences of length ( m ) multiplied by the number of middle elements.Wait, no. Let me think again. If I have a sequence ending with a middle element, say 2, then the previous element can be any element except the one that would make the difference ( n - 1 ). But since ( |2 - a_{m}| neq n - 1 ) implies ( a_{m} neq 2 + (n - 1) ) and ( a_{m} neq 2 - (n - 1) ). But both ( 2 + (n - 1) ) and ( 2 - (n - 1) ) are outside of ( A ), so actually, all previous elements are allowed. Therefore, the number of sequences ending with a middle element is equal to the total number of sequences of length ( m ) times the number of middle elements, which is ( n - 2 ).Wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify.Each middle element can follow any sequence of length ( m ), because the forbidden transitions are only from 1 to ( n ) and ( n ) to 1. So, for the middle elements, all transitions are allowed. Therefore, the number of sequences ending with a middle element is ( (n - 2) times S_m ).But actually, no. Because ( y_{m+1} ) is the number of sequences ending with any middle element. So, if each middle element can be reached from any of the previous sequences, then ( y_{m+1} = (n - 2) times S_m ).Wait, that seems too high. Let me think of it differently.Each middle element can be reached from any of the previous elements except the ones that would cause a difference of ( n - 1 ). But as we saw, for middle elements, there are no such forbidden previous elements because the forbidden ones are outside ( A ). Therefore, each middle element can be reached from any of the ( S_m ) sequences. Since there are ( n - 2 ) middle elements, the total number of sequences ending with a middle element is ( (n - 2) times S_m ).But wait, that would mean ( y_{m+1} = (n - 2) times S_m ). But ( S_m = x_m + y_m + z_m ), so substituting, we have:( x_{m+1} = x_m + y_m )( y_{m+1} = (n - 2)(x_m + y_m + z_m) )( z_{m+1} = y_m + z_m )So, combining these, we can write the recurrence relations as:( x_{m+1} = x_m + y_m )( y_{m+1} = (n - 2)S_m )( z_{m+1} = y_m + z_m )But since ( S_{m+1} = x_{m+1} + y_{m+1} + z_{m+1} ), substituting the above:( S_{m+1} = (x_m + y_m) + (n - 2)S_m + (y_m + z_m) )Simplify:( S_{m+1} = x_m + y_m + (n - 2)S_m + y_m + z_m )But ( x_m + y_m + z_m = S_m ), so:( S_{m+1} = S_m + (n - 2)S_m + y_m )Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-express:Wait, ( x_{m+1} = x_m + y_m )( z_{m+1} = y_m + z_m )So, adding ( x_{m+1} + z_{m+1} = x_m + 2y_m + z_m )Then, ( S_{m+1} = x_{m+1} + y_{m+1} + z_{m+1} = (x_m + 2y_m + z_m) + (n - 2)S_m )But ( x_m + z_m = S_m - y_m ), so:( S_{m+1} = (S_m - y_m + 2y_m) + (n - 2)S_m = S_m + y_m + (n - 2)S_m = (n - 1)S_m + y_m )Hmm, but I still have ( y_m ) in the equation. Maybe I need another approach.Alternatively, since ( y_{m+1} = (n - 2)S_m ), and ( S_{m+1} = x_{m+1} + y_{m+1} + z_{m+1} = (x_m + y_m) + (n - 2)S_m + (y_m + z_m) )Simplify:( S_{m+1} = x_m + y_m + (n - 2)S_m + y_m + z_m )But ( x_m + z_m = S_m - y_m ), so:( S_{m+1} = (S_m - y_m) + 2y_m + (n - 2)S_m = S_m + y_m + (n - 2)S_m = (n - 1)S_m + y_m )Hmm, still stuck with ( y_m ). Maybe express ( y_m ) in terms of previous ( S ).From ( y_{m} = (n - 2)S_{m - 1} ), so substituting:( S_{m+1} = (n - 1)S_m + (n - 2)S_{m - 1} )Ah, that's better! So, we have a linear recurrence relation:( S_{m+1} = (n - 1)S_m + (n - 2)S_{m - 1} )Now, we need initial conditions to solve this recurrence.For ( m = 1 ), ( S_1 = n ), since each element is a single-element sequence.For ( m = 2 ), we need to count the number of sequences of length 2 where ( |a_1 - a_2| neq n - 1 ). The total number of sequences is ( n^2 ). The number of forbidden sequences is 2: (1, n) and (n, 1). So, ( S_2 = n^2 - 2 ).So, initial conditions:( S_1 = n )( S_2 = n^2 - 2 )Now, we can use the recurrence relation to find ( S_m ) for any ( m ).But our goal is to find ( |B_n^m| ), which is ( S_m ) minus the number of sequences that don't satisfy the second condition, i.e., sequences with fewer than three distinct elements.So, we need to subtract:1. The number of sequences where all elements are the same. There are ( n ) such sequences (one for each element in ( A )).2. The number of sequences where exactly two distinct elements are used. For these, we need to choose two distinct elements from ( A ), but we have to be careful because some pairs might include 1 and ( n ), which are forbidden to be adjacent. Wait, no, the forbidden condition is only on consecutive elements, but in sequences with exactly two elements, they can alternate as long as they don't have the forbidden difference.Wait, actually, sequences with exactly two distinct elements can be formed by choosing any two elements from ( A ), except the pair ( {1, n} ), because if they are adjacent, their difference is ( n - 1 ), which is forbidden. So, the number of such pairs is ( binom{n}{2} - 1 ).For each such pair, the number of sequences of length ( m ) using exactly these two elements is ( 2^m - 2 ). We subtract 2 because we exclude the sequences where all elements are the same (which are already counted in the first case).Therefore, the total number of sequences with exactly two distinct elements is ( left( binom{n}{2} - 1 right)(2^m - 2) ).So, putting it all together, the number of valid sequences ( |B_n^m| ) is:( |B_n^m| = S_m - n - left( binom{n}{2} - 1 right)(2^m - 2) )Now, let's compute this for ( n = 6 ) and ( m = 3 ).First, compute ( S_3 ) using the recurrence relation.Given ( n = 6 ), so:( S_1 = 6 )( S_2 = 6^2 - 2 = 36 - 2 = 34 )Now, using the recurrence:( S_3 = (6 - 1)S_2 + (6 - 2)S_1 = 5 times 34 + 4 times 6 = 170 + 24 = 194 )So, ( S_3 = 194 ).Now, compute the number of sequences to subtract:1. All elements the same: ( n = 6 ).2. Exactly two distinct elements: ( binom{6}{2} - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 ). For each pair, the number of sequences is ( 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 ). So, total is ( 14 times 6 = 84 ).Therefore, ( |B_6^3| = 194 - 6 - 84 = 194 - 90 = 104 ).So, the number of elements in ( B_6^3 ) is 104."},{"question":"If the abscissa of all points on the graph of the function y=fleft(xright) is shortened to half of its original length, while the ordinate remains unchanged, and then the resulting curve is shifted to the right by frac{œÄ}{3} units, resulting in the graph of the function y=sin (x-frac{œÄ}{4}), then fleft(xright)=left(  right)A: sin (frac{x}{2}-frac{7œÄ}{12})B: sin (frac{x}{2}+frac{œÄ}{12})C: sin (2x-frac{7œÄ}{12})D: sin (2x+frac{œÄ}{12})","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about transforming a function and figuring out what the original function was. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.First, the problem says that the abscissa (which is the x-coordinate) of all points on the graph of the function y = f(x) is shortened to half of its original length. Okay, so if I have a point (a, b) on the graph of f(x), after shortening the abscissa to half, it becomes (a/2, b). That makes sense because we're compressing the graph horizontally by a factor of 2.Then, it says that the resulting curve is shifted to the right by œÄ/3 units. Shifting to the right by œÄ/3 means that every point (c, d) on the graph after the first transformation will move to (c + œÄ/3, d). So, if after the first transformation we had a point at (a/2, b), after shifting it would be at (a/2 + œÄ/3, b).Finally, the problem tells us that after these two transformations, the resulting graph is y = sin(x - œÄ/4). So, our goal is to find the original function f(x) before any transformations were applied.Let me try to write down the transformations mathematically. If we start with f(x), the first transformation is shortening the abscissa to half its length. In function terms, this is a horizontal compression by a factor of 2, which is achieved by replacing x with 2x in the function. So, the first transformed function would be f(2x).Then, shifting this resulting curve to the right by œÄ/3 units is a horizontal shift. In function terms, shifting to the right by œÄ/3 means replacing x with x - œÄ/3. So, the second transformed function would be f(2(x - œÄ/3)).Putting it all together, the transformed function is f(2(x - œÄ/3)), and we know that this equals sin(x - œÄ/4). So, we have:f(2(x - œÄ/3)) = sin(x - œÄ/4)Our goal is to find f(x). To do this, let's solve for f(x). Let's set u = 2(x - œÄ/3). Then, we can write:f(u) = sin(x - œÄ/4)But we need to express x in terms of u to substitute back into the sine function. From u = 2(x - œÄ/3), we can solve for x:u = 2x - 2œÄ/3So,2x = u + 2œÄ/3x = (u + 2œÄ/3)/2x = u/2 + œÄ/3Now, substitute this back into the sine function:f(u) = sin((u/2 + œÄ/3) - œÄ/4)Simplify the argument of the sine function:(u/2 + œÄ/3 - œÄ/4)To combine the constants œÄ/3 and -œÄ/4, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 3 and 4 is 12, so:œÄ/3 = 4œÄ/12œÄ/4 = 3œÄ/12So,œÄ/3 - œÄ/4 = 4œÄ/12 - 3œÄ/12 = œÄ/12Therefore, the argument simplifies to:u/2 + œÄ/12So, f(u) = sin(u/2 + œÄ/12)Since u is just a placeholder variable, we can replace u with x to get the original function f(x):f(x) = sin(x/2 + œÄ/12)Looking back at the options provided:A: sin(x/2 - 7œÄ/12)B: sin(x/2 + œÄ/12)C: sin(2x - 7œÄ/12)D: sin(2x + œÄ/12)Our derived function matches option B.Wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Starting with f(x), first transformation is horizontal compression by factor 2: f(2x).2. Then, shift right by œÄ/3: f(2(x - œÄ/3)).3. This equals sin(x - œÄ/4).4. Let u = 2(x - œÄ/3), so x = u/2 + œÄ/3.5. Substitute into sin(x - œÄ/4): sin(u/2 + œÄ/3 - œÄ/4).6. Simplify œÄ/3 - œÄ/4 to œÄ/12.7. So, f(u) = sin(u/2 + œÄ/12).8. Thus, f(x) = sin(x/2 + œÄ/12).Yes, that seems correct. So, option B is the right answer.Just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by reversing the transformations step by step.Starting from the final function y = sin(x - œÄ/4), we can reverse the transformations to find f(x).First, reverse the shift to the right by œÄ/3. To reverse a shift to the right, we shift to the left by œÄ/3. So, replacing x with x + œÄ/3 in the function:sin((x + œÄ/3) - œÄ/4) = sin(x + œÄ/3 - œÄ/4)Again, œÄ/3 - œÄ/4 = œÄ/12, so this becomes sin(x + œÄ/12).Now, reverse the horizontal compression by factor 2. To reverse a horizontal compression by factor 2, we perform a horizontal stretch by factor 2, which is achieved by replacing x with x/2 in the function:sin((x/2) + œÄ/12)So, f(x) = sin(x/2 + œÄ/12), which is option B.Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that option B is correct.I think I've got it. The key was to understand how each transformation affects the function and then reverse them step by step. First, reversing the shift, then reversing the compression. It's important to remember that when you reverse a horizontal transformation, you have to adjust the argument of the function accordingly.Another thing to note is the direction of the shift. Since the original transformation was shifting to the right, reversing it means shifting to the left. Similarly, reversing a compression involves stretching, which affects how the x-term is scaled in the function.It's also crucial to handle the constants correctly when combining terms like œÄ/3 and -œÄ/4. Finding a common denominator helps in simplifying these expressions accurately.Overall, breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable steps and carefully reversing each transformation one by one helped me arrive at the correct answer without getting overwhelmed."},{"question":"For how many integer values of m between 1 and 999 inclusive does the decimal representation of frac{m}{1000} terminate?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many integer values of ( m ) between 1 and 999 inclusive make the decimal representation of ( frac{m}{1000} ) terminate. Hmm, I remember something about terminating decimals from my math classes. Let me try to recall.First, I think a fraction will have a terminating decimal if, after simplifying the fraction, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 or 5. Is that right? Yeah, I think that's the rule. So, for example, ( frac{1}{2} ), ( frac{1}{4} ), ( frac{1}{5} ), ( frac{1}{8} ), ( frac{1}{10} ), etc., all have terminating decimals because their denominators are powers of 2 or 5.In this problem, the fraction is ( frac{m}{1000} ). Let me factorize 1000 to see its prime components. 1000 is equal to ( 10^3 ), which is ( (2 times 5)^3 ), so that's ( 2^3 times 5^3 ). So, the denominator is already a product of powers of 2 and 5. That should mean that ( frac{m}{1000} ) will have a terminating decimal, right?But wait, I need to make sure that when I simplify ( frac{m}{1000} ), the denominator doesn't end up having any other prime factors. Since 1000 is only composed of 2s and 5s, any common factors between ( m ) and 1000 will only be 2s or 5s. So, even if ( m ) shares some factors with 1000, the simplified denominator will still only have 2s and 5s.Let me test this with an example. Suppose ( m = 125 ). Then ( frac{125}{1000} = frac{1}{8} ), which is ( 0.125 ), a terminating decimal. Another example: ( m = 16 ). Then ( frac{16}{1000} = frac{4}{250} = frac{2}{125} ), which is ( 0.016 ), also terminating.What if ( m ) is something like 3? Then ( frac{3}{1000} ) is already in simplest form, and since the denominator is 1000, which is ( 2^3 times 5^3 ), it should terminate. Let me check: ( 3 div 1000 = 0.003 ), which is indeed terminating.Wait a second, so does that mean every ( m ) from 1 to 999 will result in a terminating decimal? Because no matter what ( m ) is, when we divide it by 1000, the denominator after simplifying will still only have 2s and 5s as prime factors. So, even if ( m ) introduces other prime factors, those would only be in the numerator, not the denominator.Let me think about another example. Suppose ( m = 7 ). Then ( frac{7}{1000} = 0.007 ), which is terminating. If ( m = 999 ), then ( frac{999}{1000} = 0.999 ), which is also terminating.So, it seems like every integer ( m ) between 1 and 999 will result in a terminating decimal when divided by 1000. Therefore, the number of such integers ( m ) is just 999.But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any case where ( frac{m}{1000} ) doesn't terminate? For that to happen, the simplified denominator would have to have prime factors other than 2 or 5. But since 1000 only has 2s and 5s, and ( m ) is just an integer, any common factors would only reduce the powers of 2 or 5 in the denominator, not introduce new primes.Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct. Every integer ( m ) from 1 to 999 inclusive will result in a terminating decimal when divided by 1000. So, the total number of such integers is 999."},{"question":"Alice needs to replace a light bulb located 15 centimeters below the ceiling in her living room. The ceiling is 3 meters above the floor.

So, f(n) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(3n - 1). The question is asking me to find what f(n+1) - f(n) equals, and it gives me four options to choose from. Alright, let me try to understand what f(n) and f(n+1) represent. f(n) is the sum of the first (3n - 1) terms of the harmonic series. So, for example, if n is 1, f(1) would be 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(3*1 - 1) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/2? Wait, no, hold on. If n is 1, then 3n - 1 is 2, so f(1) would be 1 + 1/2. Hmm, okay, that makes sense. So, for each n, f(n) adds up terms up to 1/(3n - 1). So, f(n+1) would be similar but with n replaced by n+1. That would mean f(n+1) is the sum from 1 up to 1/(3(n+1) - 1). Let me compute that: 3(n+1) - 1 = 3n + 3 - 1 = 3n + 2. So, f(n+1) is the sum from 1 up to 1/(3n + 2). Therefore, f(n+1) is a longer sum than f(n). Specifically, f(n+1) includes all the terms that f(n) has, plus some additional terms. So, when I subtract f(n) from f(n+1), I should be left with those additional terms that f(n+1) has but f(n) doesn't. Let me write this out more formally. f(n) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(3n - 1)f(n+1) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(3n - 1) + 1/(3n) + 1/(3n + 1) + 1/(3n + 2)So, when I subtract f(n) from f(n+1), all the terms from 1 up to 1/(3n - 1) cancel out, leaving me with:f(n+1) - f(n) = 1/(3n) + 1/(3n + 1) + 1/(3n + 2)Hmm, looking at the options given:A: 1/(3n + 2)B: 1/(3n) + 1/(3n + 1)C: 1/(3n + 1) + 1/(3n + 2)D: 1/(3n) + 1/(3n + 1) + 1/(3n + 2)So, according to my calculation, the difference f(n+1) - f(n) is equal to option D. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with f(n), which goes up to 1/(3n - 1). Then f(n+1) goes up to 1/(3(n+1) - 1) = 1/(3n + 2). So, the additional terms in f(n+1) compared to f(n) are 1/(3n), 1/(3n + 1), and 1/(3n + 2). Therefore, subtracting f(n) from f(n+1) should indeed give me those three terms. So, yeah, that seems correct. Option D is the right answer. But just to be thorough, let me plug in a specific value for n and see if this holds. Let's take n = 1. For n = 1, f(1) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(3*1 - 1) = 1 + 1/2. So, f(1) = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.Then f(2) would be 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(3*2 - 1) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5. So, f(2) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5.Calculating f(2) - f(1): f(2) - f(1) = (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5) - (1 + 1/2) = 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5.Which is exactly 1/(3*1) + 1/(3*1 + 1) + 1/(3*1 + 2) = 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5. So, that matches option D. Let me try n = 2 as another check. f(2) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5.f(3) would be up to 1/(3*3 - 1) = 1/8. So, f(3) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8.Therefore, f(3) - f(2) = 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8.Which is 1/(3*2) + 1/(3*2 + 1) + 1/(3*2 + 2) = 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8. Again, this matches option D. So, through both algebraic reasoning and specific examples, it seems that option D is indeed the correct answer. I think I've got this. The key was recognizing that f(n+1) includes all the terms of f(n) plus three additional terms: 1/(3n), 1/(3n + 1), and 1/(3n + 2). Subtracting f(n) from f(n+1) cancels out all the common terms, leaving just those three new terms. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the examples I tested support this conclusion. So, I feel confident that option D is the right choice.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Given that (sin alpha - cos alpha = frac{1}{5}) and (0 < alpha < 180¬∞), find the value of (operatorname{tg} alpha):(A) (frac{3}{4}),(B) (-frac{3}{4}),(C) (frac{4}{3}),(D) (-frac{4}{3}).","answer":"Alright, so I have this trigonometry problem here: Given that sin Œ± minus cos Œ± equals 1/5, and Œ± is between 0 and 180 degrees, I need to find the value of tan Œ±. The options are 3/4, -3/4, 4/3, and -4/3. Hmm, okay, let's see how I can approach this.First off, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sine and cosine, sometimes squaring both sides can help because it can lead to the use of Pythagorean identities. So, maybe I should try squaring both sides of the equation sin Œ± - cos Œ± = 1/5. Let me write that down:(sin Œ± - cos Œ±)^2 = (1/5)^2Expanding the left side, I get:sin¬≤Œ± - 2 sin Œ± cos Œ± + cos¬≤Œ± = 1/25Now, I recall that sin¬≤Œ± + cos¬≤Œ± equals 1, which is the Pythagorean identity. So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:1 - 2 sin Œ± cos Œ± = 1/25Hmm, okay, so if I subtract 1/25 from both sides, I get:1 - 1/25 = 2 sin Œ± cos Œ±Calculating 1 - 1/25, that's 24/25. So:24/25 = 2 sin Œ± cos Œ±Dividing both sides by 2:sin Œ± cos Œ± = 12/25Alright, so now I have sin Œ± cos Œ± equals 12/25. I wonder if I can use this to find tan Œ±. I know that tan Œ± is sin Œ± over cos Œ±, so maybe if I can find sin Œ± and cos Œ± individually, I can find tan Œ±.But how? I have two equations now:1. sin Œ± - cos Œ± = 1/52. sin Œ± cos Œ± = 12/25Hmm, maybe I can express sin Œ± in terms of cos Œ± from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation. Let's try that.From equation 1:sin Œ± = cos Œ± + 1/5Now, substitute this into equation 2:(cos Œ± + 1/5) cos Œ± = 12/25Expanding that:cos¬≤Œ± + (1/5) cos Œ± = 12/25Let me write this as a quadratic equation in terms of cos Œ±:cos¬≤Œ± + (1/5) cos Œ± - 12/25 = 0To make it easier, I'll multiply every term by 25 to eliminate the denominators:25 cos¬≤Œ± + 5 cos Œ± - 12 = 0Now, this is a quadratic equation in cos Œ±. Let me denote x = cos Œ± for simplicity:25x¬≤ + 5x - 12 = 0I can solve this quadratic using the quadratic formula:x = [-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)] / (2a)Where a = 25, b = 5, and c = -12.Calculating the discriminant:b¬≤ - 4ac = 25 - 4*25*(-12) = 25 + 1200 = 1225‚àö1225 = 35So, x = [-5 ¬± 35] / (2*25)Calculating both possibilities:First solution:x = (-5 + 35)/50 = 30/50 = 3/5Second solution:x = (-5 - 35)/50 = -40/50 = -4/5So, cos Œ± can be either 3/5 or -4/5.Now, let's find the corresponding sin Œ± for each case using equation 1: sin Œ± = cos Œ± + 1/5.Case 1: cos Œ± = 3/5sin Œ± = 3/5 + 1/5 = 4/5Case 2: cos Œ± = -4/5sin Œ± = -4/5 + 1/5 = -3/5Now, let's check if these solutions make sense in the given range of Œ±, which is between 0 and 180 degrees.In the first case, cos Œ± = 3/5 and sin Œ± = 4/5. Both are positive, which would place Œ± in the first quadrant, between 0 and 90 degrees. That's valid.In the second case, cos Œ± = -4/5 and sin Œ± = -3/5. Both are negative, which would place Œ± in the third quadrant. However, the given range is 0 < Œ± < 180 degrees, which doesn't include the third quadrant (180 to 270 degrees). So, this solution is invalid.Therefore, the only valid solution is cos Œ± = 3/5 and sin Œ± = 4/5.Now, tan Œ± is sin Œ± over cos Œ±, so:tan Œ± = (4/5) / (3/5) = 4/3So, the value of tan Œ± is 4/3, which corresponds to option C.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I squared the original equation, which can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, since we checked the validity based on the given range, it should be okay. Also, the calculations seem correct: solving the quadratic, finding the valid cosine and sine values, and computing tan Œ±. Yeah, I think that's solid.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"The sequence (left{a_{n}right}) is defined by (a_{1}=1.5) and (a_{n}=frac{1}{n^{2}-1}) for (n in mathbb{N}, n>1). Are there any values of (n) such that the sum of the first (n) terms of this sequence differs from 2.25 by less than 0.01? If yes, find the smallest such value of (n).","answer":"Okay, so I have this sequence where the first term is 1.5, and then for every term after that, it's defined as 1 divided by (n squared minus 1). I need to figure out if there's a point where the sum of the first n terms is really close to 2.25, specifically within 0.01. And if such an n exists, I need to find the smallest one.Alright, let's start by writing down what we know. The sequence is {a_n}, with a_1 = 1.5, and for n > 1, a_n = 1/(n¬≤ - 1). I need to find the sum S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n and see when this sum is within 0.01 of 2.25.First, maybe I should write out the first few terms to get a sense of what's happening. a_1 is 1.5, a_2 is 1/(4 - 1) = 1/3 ‚âà 0.333, a_3 is 1/(9 - 1) = 1/8 = 0.125, a_4 is 1/(16 - 1) = 1/15 ‚âà 0.0667, and so on. So each term is getting smaller as n increases.Adding up these terms, the sum S_n will be 1.5 + 0.333 + 0.125 + 0.0667 + ... and so on. I wonder if this series converges or diverges. Since the terms are getting smaller and approaching zero, it might converge. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.Wait, the problem is asking about the sum being close to 2.25. So maybe the series converges to something around there? Let me check.I remember that for series like 1/(n¬≤ - 1), we can use partial fractions to simplify. Let me try that. So, 1/(n¬≤ - 1) can be written as A/(n - 1) + B/(n + 1). Let's solve for A and B.1 = A(n + 1) + B(n - 1). Let's plug in n = 1: 1 = A(2) + B(0) => A = 1/2. Similarly, plug in n = -1: 1 = A(0) + B(-2) => B = -1/2. So, 1/(n¬≤ - 1) = (1/2)(1/(n - 1) - 1/(n + 1)).Ah, that's a telescoping series! That means when we sum these terms, a lot of them will cancel out. Let's write out the sum from n=2 to n=k of a_n:Sum = (1/2)[(1/1 - 1/3) + (1/2 - 1/4) + (1/3 - 1/5) + ... + (1/(k-1) - 1/(k+1))].When we add these up, most of the middle terms cancel out. Let's see:- The -1/3 cancels with the +1/3 in the next term.- Similarly, -1/4 cancels with +1/4, and so on.So, what's left is the first few terms that don't get canceled. Specifically, the first term is 1/1, and then 1/2, and the last terms are -1/k and -1/(k+1). Wait, actually, let's count:After cancellation, the sum becomes (1/2)[1 + 1/2 - 1/k - 1/(k+1)].So, the sum from n=2 to n=k is (1/2)(3/2 - (1/k + 1/(k+1))).Therefore, the total sum S_k is a_1 plus this sum. Since a_1 is 1.5, which is 3/2, let's add that:S_k = 3/2 + (1/2)(3/2 - (1/k + 1/(k+1))) = 3/2 + 3/4 - (1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))).Simplifying, 3/2 is 1.5, and 3/4 is 0.75, so 1.5 + 0.75 is 2.25. So, S_k = 2.25 - (1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))).So, S_k = 2.25 - [1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))].Now, we need S_k to be within 0.01 of 2.25. That means |S_k - 2.25| < 0.01.But S_k is 2.25 minus something, so |S_k - 2.25| is just that something. So, we have:[1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))] < 0.01.Let me write that as:(1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))) < 0.01.I can factor out 1/2:(1/2)(1/k + 1/(k+1)) < 0.01.Multiply both sides by 2:1/k + 1/(k+1) < 0.02.So, we need 1/k + 1/(k+1) < 0.02.Let me denote f(k) = 1/k + 1/(k+1). We need f(k) < 0.02.I can approximate this. Since 1/k + 1/(k+1) is approximately 2/k for large k, because 1/(k+1) is roughly similar to 1/k. So, 2/k < 0.02 => k > 100.But let's check more precisely.Let me write f(k) = 1/k + 1/(k+1) = (2k + 1)/(k(k+1)).We need (2k + 1)/(k(k+1)) < 0.02.Multiply both sides by k(k+1):2k + 1 < 0.02k(k + 1).Let's write this as:2k + 1 < 0.02k¬≤ + 0.02k.Bring all terms to one side:0.02k¬≤ + 0.02k - 2k - 1 > 0.Simplify:0.02k¬≤ - 1.98k - 1 > 0.Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate decimals:2k¬≤ - 198k - 100 > 0.So, 2k¬≤ - 198k - 100 > 0.This is a quadratic inequality. Let's find the roots of 2k¬≤ - 198k - 100 = 0.Using the quadratic formula:k = [198 ¬± sqrt(198¬≤ + 4*2*100)] / (2*2).Compute discriminant:D = 198¬≤ + 800 = 39204 + 800 = 40004.sqrt(40004) ‚âà 200.01.So, k ‚âà [198 ¬± 200.01]/4.We discard the negative root because k must be positive.So, k ‚âà (198 + 200.01)/4 ‚âà (398.01)/4 ‚âà 99.5025.So, the quadratic is positive when k > 99.5025.Since k must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 99.5025 is 100.Therefore, when k = 100, the inequality holds.But let's verify for k=100:f(100) = 1/100 + 1/101 ‚âà 0.01 + 0.00990099 ‚âà 0.01990099, which is approximately 0.0199, which is less than 0.02. Wait, but we needed f(k) < 0.02.Wait, 0.0199 is less than 0.02, so yes, it satisfies.But let's check k=99:f(99) = 1/99 + 1/100 ‚âà 0.01010101 + 0.01 ‚âà 0.02010101, which is slightly more than 0.02.So, at k=99, f(k) ‚âà 0.0201 > 0.02, which doesn't satisfy the inequality.Therefore, the smallest k where f(k) < 0.02 is k=100.But wait, in our earlier steps, we had S_k = 2.25 - [1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))]. So, the difference between S_k and 2.25 is [1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))], which we set to be less than 0.01.Wait, hold on, I think I made a miscalculation earlier.Wait, in the beginning, I had:S_k = 2.25 - [1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))].So, the difference |S_k - 2.25| is [1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))], which we need to be less than 0.01.So, [1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))] < 0.01.Which is equivalent to [1/k + 1/(k+1)] < 0.02.So, that's correct.So, solving [1/k + 1/(k+1)] < 0.02, we found that k must be greater than approximately 99.5, so k=100.Therefore, the smallest n is 100.Wait, but let me check for n=100:Compute [1/100 + 1/101]/2 = (0.01 + ~0.00990099)/2 ‚âà (0.01990099)/2 ‚âà 0.009950495, which is less than 0.01.Wait, so [1/(2k) + 1/(2(k+1))] = [1/200 + 1/202] ‚âà 0.005 + 0.004950495 ‚âà 0.009950495 < 0.01.Yes, so for n=100, the difference is less than 0.01.But for n=99:[1/198 + 1/199]/2 ‚âà (0.005050505 + 0.0050251256)/2 ‚âà (0.01007563)/2 ‚âà 0.005037815, which is still less than 0.01.Wait, that can't be right because earlier, when I computed f(k)=1/k +1/(k+1) for k=99, it was ~0.0201, which is greater than 0.02, but when I compute [1/(2k) +1/(2(k+1))], it's half of that, so ~0.01005, which is still greater than 0.01.Wait, so for n=99, [1/(2*99) +1/(2*100)] = [1/198 +1/200] ‚âà 0.005050505 + 0.005 = 0.010050505, which is just over 0.01.So, for n=99, the difference is ~0.01005 > 0.01, so it doesn't satisfy.For n=100, the difference is ~0.00995 < 0.01, so it does satisfy.Therefore, the smallest n is 100.Wait, but let me confirm with exact fractions.For n=100:1/(2*100) +1/(2*101) = 1/200 +1/202.Compute 1/200 = 0.005, 1/202 ‚âà 0.004950495.Sum ‚âà 0.009950495 < 0.01.For n=99:1/(2*99) +1/(2*100) = 1/198 +1/200.1/198 ‚âà 0.005050505, 1/200 = 0.005.Sum ‚âà 0.010050505 > 0.01.So, indeed, n=100 is the smallest n where the difference is less than 0.01.Therefore, the answer is n=100."},{"question":"One type of liquid contains 10% of water and the second type of liquid contains 15% of water.

What is the probability that on exactly two of these occasions the resident supports the environmental policy?A. 0.360B. 0.420C. 0.432D. 0.489","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about probability, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\\"A recent survey indicates that 60% of residents support a new local environmental policy. A conducting interview chooses a resident at random three separate times. What is the probability that on exactly two of these occasions the resident supports the environmental policy?\\"Alright, so we're dealing with probabilities here. Let me break it down.First, the survey says 60% support the policy. That means if I pick a resident at random, there's a 60% chance they support it, and a 40% chance they don't. So, P(Support) = 0.6, and P(Not Support) = 0.4.Now, the interview is choosing a resident three separate times. So, it's like three independent trials, right? Each time, the resident is chosen at random, and their support is noted. We want the probability that exactly two out of these three support the policy.Hmm, okay. So, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. I remember that binomial probability is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes, and we want the probability of a certain number of successes.The formula for binomial probability is:P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)Where:- P(k) is the probability of k successes,- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,- p is the probability of success on a single trial,- n is the number of trials.In this case, n = 3 (three interviews), k = 2 (exactly two supporting), p = 0.6 (probability of support), and (1-p) = 0.4 (probability of not supporting).So, plugging in the numbers:P(2) = C(3, 2) * (0.6)^2 * (0.4)^(3-2)First, let's calculate C(3, 2). That's the number of ways to choose 2 successes out of 3 trials. The formula for combinations is:C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)So, C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3 - 2)!) = (6) / (2 * 1) = 3.Okay, so C(3, 2) is 3.Next, (0.6)^2 is 0.36.Then, (0.4)^(3-2) is (0.4)^1, which is 0.4.Now, multiply them all together:P(2) = 3 * 0.36 * 0.4Let me calculate that step by step.First, 3 * 0.36 = 1.08.Then, 1.08 * 0.4 = 0.432.So, the probability is 0.432.Wait, let me double-check that. Sometimes when dealing with probabilities, it's easy to make a mistake.So, C(3, 2) is indeed 3 because there are three ways to have two successes in three trials: the first and second, the first and third, or the second and third.Each of these has a probability of (0.6)^2 * (0.4)^1 = 0.36 * 0.4 = 0.144.So, adding them up: 0.144 + 0.144 + 0.144 = 0.432.Yep, that checks out.Alternatively, I could think about it as listing all possible outcomes and counting the ones where exactly two support.The possible outcomes for three trials are:1. Support, Support, Support2. Support, Support, Not Support3. Support, Not Support, Support4. Not Support, Support, Support5. Support, Not Support, Not Support6. Not Support, Support, Not Support7. Not Support, Not Support, Support8. Not Support, Not Support, Not SupportOut of these 8 possible outcomes, the ones where exactly two support are outcomes 2, 3, and 4. So, three outcomes.Each of these has a probability of (0.6)^2 * (0.4)^1 = 0.144, as calculated before.So, 3 * 0.144 = 0.432.Therefore, the probability is 0.432.Looking back at the options given:A. 0.360B. 0.420C. 0.432D. 0.489So, 0.432 is option C.I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. It makes sense because with a higher probability of supporting (60%), having two out of three supporting is a significant probability, but not the highest. The highest would be all three supporting, which would be (0.6)^3 = 0.216, but that's less than 0.432, which seems a bit counterintuitive at first, but since we're considering exactly two, it's higher.Wait, actually, let me check that. If all three supporting is 0.216, and exactly two supporting is 0.432, that means exactly two is more likely than all three. That seems correct because 60% is a high probability, but not overwhelmingly so.Alternatively, if the probability of support was higher, say 80%, then all three supporting would be 0.512, which is higher than exactly two supporting, which would be 3 * (0.8)^2 * (0.2) = 3 * 0.64 * 0.2 = 0.384.So, in this case, with 60%, exactly two is more likely than all three.Alright, that makes sense.So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 0.432, which is option C."},{"question":"In the rectangular coordinate system xOy, the parametric equations of line l are given by: begin{cases} x=1+t  y=2-2t end{cases} (t is the parameter).

The line l intersects the circle at points A and B. Calculate the length of the segment AB.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about finding the length of segment AB where line l intersects circle C. Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, the problem gives me the parametric equations of line l:[begin{cases}x = 1 + t y = 2 - 2tend{cases}]where t is the parameter. I remember that parametric equations can be converted into a standard linear equation by eliminating the parameter. So, I need to express t from one equation and substitute it into the other.From the first equation, x = 1 + t, I can solve for t:[t = x - 1]Now, substitute this into the second equation:[y = 2 - 2t = 2 - 2(x - 1) = 2 - 2x + 2 = 4 - 2x]So, the standard equation of line l is:[y = -2x + 4]Alternatively, I can write it in the form Ax + By + C = 0:[2x + y - 4 = 0]Okay, that seems straightforward.Next, the problem mentions a circle C with the polar equation:[rho = 2costheta]I need to convert this polar equation into rectangular coordinates to understand the circle's properties better. I recall that in polar coordinates, (rho = 2costheta) can be converted using the relationships:[x = rhocostheta quad text{and} quad y = rhosintheta]Also, (rho^2 = x^2 + y^2).Starting with the given polar equation:[rho = 2costheta]Multiply both sides by (rho):[rho^2 = 2rhocostheta]Now, substitute (rho^2 = x^2 + y^2) and (rhocostheta = x):[x^2 + y^2 = 2x]This simplifies to:[x^2 - 2x + y^2 = 0]To write this in standard form, I can complete the square for the x-terms:[x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 = 1]Which becomes:[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1]So, the circle C has center at (1, 0) and radius 1. Got it.Now, I need to find where line l intersects this circle. The line l is given by 2x + y - 4 = 0, and the circle is (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1. To find the points of intersection, I can solve these two equations simultaneously.Let me solve the equation of the line for y:[2x + y - 4 = 0 implies y = -2x + 4]Now, substitute this expression for y into the circle's equation:[(x - 1)^2 + (-2x + 4)^2 = 1]Let me expand both terms:First, (x - 1)^2:[(x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1]Next, (-2x + 4)^2:[(-2x + 4)^2 = (2x - 4)^2 = (2x)^2 - 2*2x*4 + 4^2 = 4x^2 - 16x + 16]So, substituting back into the circle equation:[(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (4x^2 - 16x + 16) = 1]Combine like terms:[x^2 + 4x^2 - 2x - 16x + 1 + 16 = 1]Simplify:[5x^2 - 18x + 17 = 1]Subtract 1 from both sides:[5x^2 - 18x + 16 = 0]Now, I have a quadratic equation in terms of x:[5x^2 - 18x + 16 = 0]I can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:[x = frac{18 pm sqrt{(-18)^2 - 4*5*16}}{2*5}]Calculate the discriminant:[D = 324 - 320 = 4]So, the solutions are:[x = frac{18 pm 2}{10}]Which gives:[x = frac{20}{10} = 2 quad text{and} quad x = frac{16}{10} = 1.6]So, the x-coordinates of points A and B are 2 and 1.6, respectively.Now, let's find the corresponding y-coordinates using the equation of the line y = -2x + 4.For x = 2:[y = -2*2 + 4 = -4 + 4 = 0]So, one point is (2, 0).For x = 1.6:[y = -2*1.6 + 4 = -3.2 + 4 = 0.8]So, the other point is (1.6, 0.8).Therefore, the points of intersection are A(2, 0) and B(1.6, 0.8).Now, I need to find the distance between points A and B. The distance formula is:[|AB| = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}]Substituting the coordinates:[|AB| = sqrt{(1.6 - 2)^2 + (0.8 - 0)^2} = sqrt{(-0.4)^2 + (0.8)^2} = sqrt{0.16 + 0.64} = sqrt{0.8}]Simplify (sqrt{0.8}):[sqrt{0.8} = sqrt{frac{4}{5}} = frac{2}{sqrt{5}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}]So, the length of segment AB is (frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the quadratic equation:5x¬≤ - 18x + 16 = 0Discriminant D = 324 - 320 = 4, which is correct.Solutions:x = (18 ¬± 2)/10 => x = 2 and x = 1.6, which seems right.Then, plugging back into y = -2x + 4:For x = 2, y = 0; for x = 1.6, y = 0.8. That looks correct.Distance between (2, 0) and (1.6, 0.8):Difference in x: 1.6 - 2 = -0.4Difference in y: 0.8 - 0 = 0.8Squares: (-0.4)¬≤ = 0.16, (0.8)¬≤ = 0.64Sum: 0.16 + 0.64 = 0.8Square root: ‚àö0.8 = 2‚àö5 / 5. Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, I could have used another method, like finding the distance from the center of the circle to the line and then using the formula for chord length.Let me try that method as a check.The center of the circle is (1, 0). The line is 2x + y - 4 = 0.The distance from the center to the line is given by:[d = frac{|2*1 + 1*0 - 4|}{sqrt{2^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|2 - 4|}{sqrt{5}} = frac{2}{sqrt{5}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}]The radius of the circle is 1.The length of the chord AB is given by:[|AB| = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} = 2sqrt{1 - left(frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}right)^2} = 2sqrt{1 - frac{4*5}{25}} = 2sqrt{1 - frac{20}{25}} = 2sqrt{frac{5}{25}} = 2sqrt{frac{1}{5}} = frac{2}{sqrt{5}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}]So, this method also gives the same result, which confirms that the length of AB is indeed ( frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} ).I think that solidifies the answer. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the length of segment AB is ( frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} ).**Final Answer**The length of segment ( AB ) is boxed{dfrac{2sqrt{5}}{5}}."},{"question":"In the prime factorization of 30!, what is the exponent of 3?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: In the prime factorization of 30!, what is the exponent of 3? Hmm, I remember that factorials involve multiplying a sequence of numbers, and prime factorization breaks down a number into its prime components. So, 30! means 30 factorial, which is 30 multiplied by 29, 28, all the way down to 1. That's a huge number! But I don't need to calculate the whole thing; instead, I just need to find out how many times the prime number 3 appears in its prime factorization.I think there's a method to find the exponent of a prime in a factorial. Maybe it's something to do with dividing the number by the prime and counting how many multiples there are? Let me recall. Oh, right! It's called Legendre's formula. It helps determine the exponent of a prime number in the factorization of a factorial. The formula is something like this: for a prime p and a number n, the exponent of p in n! is the sum of the floor division of n by p, n by p squared, n by p cubed, and so on, until the division results in zero.So, in this case, p is 3 and n is 30. I need to calculate the sum of floor(30/3) + floor(30/9) + floor(30/27) + floor(30/81) + ... until the division gives zero.Let me start with the first term: floor(30/3). That's 30 divided by 3, which is exactly 10. So, the first term is 10.Next, floor(30/9). 30 divided by 9 is approximately 3.333..., but since we take the floor, it becomes 3. So, the second term is 3.Then, floor(30/27). 30 divided by 27 is approximately 1.111..., and taking the floor gives 1. So, the third term is 1.Now, floor(30/81). 81 is larger than 30, so 30 divided by 81 is less than 1, specifically about 0.370..., and the floor of that is 0. Since we've reached zero, we can stop here.Adding up all these terms: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. So, the exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of 30! should be 14.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, starting from 3, each multiple contributes at least one 3. Then, multiples of 9 contribute an extra 3, and multiples of 27 contribute yet another 3. Let's list out the numbers from 1 to 30 and count the number of 3s.Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30. That's 10 numbers, each contributing at least one 3.Now, among these, the multiples of 9 are 9, 18, 27. Each of these has an additional 3, so that's 3 more.And then, the multiple of 27 is just 27, which has yet another 3. So, that's 1 more.Adding them up: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. Yep, that matches what I got earlier with Legendre's formula. So, I think I'm confident that the exponent of 3 in 30! is 14.I guess another way to think about it is that every time you multiply by a multiple of 3, you're adding another 3 to the prime factors. But since some numbers contribute more than one 3 (like 9 is 3 squared, so it contributes two 3s), you have to account for those extra factors. That's why you divide by higher powers of 3 and take the floor each time‚Äîbecause each higher power represents an additional 3 in the factorization.So, just to recap:- Divide 30 by 3: 10, which counts the multiples of 3.- Divide 30 by 9: 3, which counts the multiples of 9, each contributing an extra 3.- Divide 30 by 27: 1, which counts the multiples of 27, each contributing yet another 3.- Divide 30 by 81: 0, so we stop.Adding these up gives the total number of 3s in the prime factorization of 30!. That makes sense. I think I've got it right."},{"question":"Three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60.

The difference in their weights is 74 kg minus 65 kg, which equals 9 kg. This means the total weight of the group increases by 9 kg.Next, to find out how this change affects the average weight of the group, I divide the total weight increase by the number of people in the group.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that the roots of unity are the solutions to the equation ( z^n = 1 ). These roots are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. So, if all the roots of ( z^6 - z^3 + 1 = 0 ) are ( n )-th roots of unity, then each root must satisfy ( z^n = 1 ).Let me write down the given equation again: ( z^6 - z^3 + 1 = 0 ). Maybe I can manipulate this equation to relate it to ( z^n = 1 ). Let's see.I notice that the equation is a quadratic in terms of ( z^3 ). Let me substitute ( w = z^3 ). Then the equation becomes ( w^2 - w + 1 = 0 ). That seems simpler. Let me solve for ( w ):Using the quadratic formula, ( w = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = frac{1 pm sqrt{-3}}{2} = frac{1 pm isqrt{3}}{2} ).So, ( w = frac{1 + isqrt{3}}{2} ) or ( w = frac{1 - isqrt{3}}{2} ). These are complex numbers. Let me express them in polar form to make it easier to find their roots.The modulus of each ( w ) is ( sqrt{left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{4}} = sqrt{1} = 1 ). So, both ( w ) values lie on the unit circle.The argument for ( w = frac{1 + isqrt{3}}{2} ) is ( frac{pi}{3} ) because it's in the first quadrant and corresponds to a 60-degree angle. Similarly, the argument for ( w = frac{1 - isqrt{3}}{2} ) is ( -frac{pi}{3} ) or ( frac{5pi}{3} ) if we consider the positive angle.So, in polar form, ( w = e^{ipi/3} ) and ( w = e^{-ipi/3} ). Since ( w = z^3 ), we can write ( z^3 = e^{ipi/3} ) or ( z^3 = e^{-ipi/3} ).To find ( z ), we take the cube roots of these. Remember that when taking roots of complex numbers, we have to consider all the possible roots by adding multiples of ( 2pi ) to the angle.Let's start with ( z^3 = e^{ipi/3} ). The solutions will be ( z = e^{i(pi/9 + 2kpi/3)} ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2 ). Similarly, for ( z^3 = e^{-ipi/3} ), the solutions will be ( z = e^{i(-pi/9 + 2kpi/3)} ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2 ).So, let's compute these roots:For ( z^3 = e^{ipi/3} ):- ( k = 0 ): ( z = e^{ipi/9} )- ( k = 1 ): ( z = e^{i(pi/9 + 2pi/3)} = e^{i7pi/9} )- ( k = 2 ): ( z = e^{i(pi/9 + 4pi/3)} = e^{i13pi/9} )For ( z^3 = e^{-ipi/3} ):- ( k = 0 ): ( z = e^{-ipi/9} = e^{i17pi/9} )- ( k = 1 ): ( z = e^{-ipi/9 + i2pi/3} = e^{i5pi/9} )- ( k = 2 ): ( z = e^{-ipi/9 + i4pi/3} = e^{i11pi/9} )So, all the roots of the original equation are:( e^{ipi/9} ), ( e^{i7pi/9} ), ( e^{i13pi/9} ), ( e^{i17pi/9} ), ( e^{i5pi/9} ), ( e^{i11pi/9} ).Now, I need to check if these roots are ( n )-th roots of unity for some ( n ). That is, each of these roots should satisfy ( z^n = 1 ).Looking at the angles, each root has an angle that is a multiple of ( pi/9 ). So, if I can find an ( n ) such that ( (e^{ipi/9})^n = e^{inpi/9} = 1 ), then ( npi/9 ) must be a multiple of ( 2pi ). So, ( npi/9 = 2pi k ) for some integer ( k ), which simplifies to ( n = 18k ).The smallest positive integer ( n ) that satisfies this is ( n = 18 ). Let me verify this.If ( n = 18 ), then ( e^{ipi/9 times 18} = e^{i2pi} = 1 ), which is correct. Similarly, for any of the roots ( e^{i kpi/9} ), raising them to the 18th power would give ( e^{i kpi/9 times 18} = e^{i2kpi} = 1 ).Therefore, all the roots are 18th roots of unity. Is 18 the smallest such ( n )? Let's check if a smaller ( n ) could work.Suppose ( n = 9 ). Then, ( e^{ipi/9 times 9} = e^{ipi} = -1 neq 1 ). So, ( n = 9 ) doesn't work. What about ( n = 6 )? ( e^{ipi/9 times 6} = e^{i2pi/3} neq 1 ). Similarly, ( n = 12 ): ( e^{ipi/9 times 12} = e^{i4pi/3} neq 1 ). So, none of these smaller ( n ) values work.Hence, the smallest positive integer ( n ) is indeed 18."},{"question":"The graph of the function f(x) = a^{x+1} + 1 always passes through a fixed point P.

The options are:A: ( a > b > c )B: ( a > c > b )C: ( c > a > b )D: ( b > c > a )Okay, let me start by understanding each of these expressions.First, ( a = 2^{0.2} ). That‚Äôs 2 raised to the power of 0.2. Since 0.2 is the same as 1/5, this is the fifth root of 2. I know that the fifth root of 2 is a number slightly greater than 1 because 2 raised to any positive power greater than 0 is greater than 1. So, ( a > 1 ).Next, ( b = 0.4^{0.2} ). That‚Äôs 0.4 raised to the power of 0.2. 0.4 is less than 1, and when you raise a number less than 1 to a positive power, the result is greater than the original number but still less than 1. So, ( b < 1 ).Similarly, ( c = 0.4^{0.6} ). Again, 0.4 is less than 1, and raising it to a higher power (0.6 is greater than 0.2) will make it even smaller. So, ( c < b ).Wait, let me think about that again. If I have a number between 0 and 1, say 0.4, and I raise it to a higher exponent, does it get smaller or larger? For example, ( 0.4^1 = 0.4 ), ( 0.4^2 = 0.16 ), ( 0.4^3 = 0.064 ), and so on. So, yes, as the exponent increases, the result decreases. Therefore, ( 0.4^{0.6} < 0.4^{0.2} ), which means ( c < b ).So, putting it all together:- ( a > 1 )- ( b < 1 )- ( c < b )Therefore, ( a > b > c ).But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should calculate approximate values to be sure.Calculating ( a = 2^{0.2} ). Let me recall that ( 2^{0.1} ) is approximately 1.0718, so ( 2^{0.2} ) would be ( (2^{0.1})^2 approx 1.0718^2 approx 1.1487 ).For ( b = 0.4^{0.2} ). Let me take the natural logarithm to make it easier:( ln(b) = 0.2 times ln(0.4) approx 0.2 times (-0.9163) approx -0.1833 )So, ( b approx e^{-0.1833} approx 0.833 ).Similarly, ( c = 0.4^{0.6} ). Again, using logarithms:( ln(c) = 0.6 times ln(0.4) approx 0.6 times (-0.9163) approx -0.5498 )Thus, ( c approx e^{-0.5498} approx 0.578 ).So, approximately:- ( a approx 1.1487 )- ( b approx 0.833 )- ( c approx 0.578 )Therefore, ( a > b > c ), which confirms my earlier conclusion.I think that's solid.

I remember that for functions of the form ( A cos x + B sin x ), the maximum value is ( sqrt{A^2 + B^2} ). So, in this case, ( A = 1 ) and ( B = sqrt{3} ). Let me calculate that.Calculating the maximum value:( sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2 ). So, the maximum value ( a ) is 2. That seems straightforward.Now, substituting ( a = 2 ) into the binomial expression, we get:( (2 sqrt{x} - frac{1}{sqrt{x}})^6 ). I need to expand this and find the coefficient of the ( x^2 ) term.I remember that the binomial expansion of ( (A + B)^n ) is given by:( sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} A^{n - k} B^k ). So, in this case, ( A = 2 sqrt{x} ) and ( B = -frac{1}{sqrt{x}} ), and ( n = 6 ).Let me write the general term in the expansion:( T_{k+1} = binom{6}{k} (2 sqrt{x})^{6 - k} left(-frac{1}{sqrt{x}}right)^k ).Simplifying each part:First, ( (2 sqrt{x})^{6 - k} = 2^{6 - k} (sqrt{x})^{6 - k} = 2^{6 - k} x^{frac{6 - k}{2}} ).Second, ( left(-frac{1}{sqrt{x}}right)^k = (-1)^k left(frac{1}{sqrt{x}}right)^k = (-1)^k x^{-frac{k}{2}} ).Multiplying these together:( T_{k+1} = binom{6}{k} cdot 2^{6 - k} cdot (-1)^k cdot x^{frac{6 - k}{2} - frac{k}{2}} ).Simplifying the exponent:( frac{6 - k}{2} - frac{k}{2} = frac{6 - k - k}{2} = frac{6 - 2k}{2} = 3 - k ).So, the general term becomes:( T_{k+1} = binom{6}{k} cdot 2^{6 - k} cdot (-1)^k cdot x^{3 - k} ).We need the term where the exponent of ( x ) is 2. So, set ( 3 - k = 2 ). Solving for ( k ):( 3 - k = 2 ) implies ( k = 1 ).Therefore, the term corresponding to ( k = 1 ) will have ( x^2 ). Let's compute that term.Calculating ( T_{2} ):( T_{2} = binom{6}{1} cdot 2^{6 - 1} cdot (-1)^1 cdot x^{3 - 1} ).Compute each part:- ( binom{6}{1} = 6 )- ( 2^{5} = 32 )- ( (-1)^1 = -1 )- ( x^{2} )Putting it all together:( T_{2} = 6 cdot 32 cdot (-1) cdot x^2 = -192 x^2 ).So, the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is -192.

So, each term is defined based on the previous term. That means if I know a‚ÇÅ, I can find a‚ÇÇ, then a‚ÇÉ, and so on. But I don't know a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, or a‚ÇÉ individually, just their sum. So, maybe I can express a‚ÇÇ and a‚ÇÉ in terms of a‚ÇÅ and then use the recursive formula to find a pattern or something.Let me try that. Let's denote a‚ÇÅ as x for simplicity. Then, a‚ÇÇ would be -1/(x + 1) based on the recursive formula. Then, a‚ÇÉ would be -1/(a‚ÇÇ + 1). Let me compute a‚ÇÉ:a‚ÇÉ = -1/(a‚ÇÇ + 1) = -1/(-1/(x + 1) + 1).Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me simplify the denominator first:-1/(x + 1) + 1 = (-1 + (x + 1))/(x + 1) = (x)/(x + 1).So, a‚ÇÉ = -1/(x/(x + 1)) = - (x + 1)/x.Okay, so a‚ÇÉ is - (x + 1)/x. Now, the sum a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇ + a‚ÇÉ is given as 6. Let's write that out:x + (-1/(x + 1)) + (- (x + 1)/x) = 6.Hmm, that's an equation in terms of x. Let me write that more clearly:x - 1/(x + 1) - (x + 1)/x = 6.This seems a bit messy, but maybe I can find a common denominator or simplify it somehow. Let me try to combine the terms:First, let's combine the two fractions: -1/(x + 1) - (x + 1)/x.To combine these, I need a common denominator, which would be x(x + 1). So:-1/(x + 1) = -x / [x(x + 1)],and-(x + 1)/x = -(x + 1)^2 / [x(x + 1)].So, combining these:[-x - (x + 1)^2] / [x(x + 1)].Let me expand (x + 1)^2:(x + 1)^2 = x¬≤ + 2x + 1.So, substituting back:[-x - (x¬≤ + 2x + 1)] / [x(x + 1)] = (-x - x¬≤ - 2x - 1) / [x(x + 1)] = (-x¬≤ - 3x - 1) / [x(x + 1)].So, now the entire equation becomes:x + [(-x¬≤ - 3x - 1) / (x(x + 1))] = 6.Let me write this as:x - (x¬≤ + 3x + 1)/(x(x + 1)) = 6.To combine these terms, I'll express x as [x¬≤(x + 1)] / [x(x + 1)] to have the same denominator. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can multiply both sides by x(x + 1) to eliminate the denominator.Let's try that. Multiply both sides by x(x + 1):x * x(x + 1) - (x¬≤ + 3x + 1) = 6 * x(x + 1).Simplify each term:First term: x * x(x + 1) = x¬≤(x + 1) = x¬≥ + x¬≤.Second term: -(x¬≤ + 3x + 1).Third term: 6x(x + 1) = 6x¬≤ + 6x.So, putting it all together:x¬≥ + x¬≤ - x¬≤ - 3x - 1 = 6x¬≤ + 6x.Simplify the left side:x¬≥ + x¬≤ - x¬≤ - 3x - 1 = x¬≥ - 3x - 1.So, the equation becomes:x¬≥ - 3x - 1 = 6x¬≤ + 6x.Let's bring all terms to one side:x¬≥ - 6x¬≤ - 3x - 6x - 1 = 0.Wait, that's not quite right. Let me subtract 6x¬≤ + 6x from both sides:x¬≥ - 3x - 1 - 6x¬≤ - 6x = 0.Combine like terms:x¬≥ - 6x¬≤ - 9x - 1 = 0.Hmm, so I have a cubic equation: x¬≥ - 6x¬≤ - 9x - 1 = 0. That seems a bit complicated. Maybe I made a mistake earlier in simplifying. Let me double-check my steps.Starting from the sum:x - 1/(x + 1) - (x + 1)/x = 6.Then, combining the fractions:-1/(x + 1) - (x + 1)/x = (-x - (x + 1)^2)/[x(x + 1)].Wait, is that correct? Let me re-examine:-1/(x + 1) - (x + 1)/x.To combine these, I need a common denominator of x(x + 1). So:-1/(x + 1) = -x / [x(x + 1)],and-(x + 1)/x = -(x + 1)^2 / [x(x + 1)].So, combining these:[-x - (x + 1)^2] / [x(x + 1)].Yes, that part seems correct. Then expanding (x + 1)^2:x¬≤ + 2x + 1.So, numerator becomes:-x - x¬≤ - 2x - 1 = -x¬≤ - 3x - 1.So, that part is correct. Then, the entire equation is:x + (-x¬≤ - 3x - 1)/(x(x + 1)) = 6.Multiplying both sides by x(x + 1):x * x(x + 1) - (x¬≤ + 3x + 1) = 6x(x + 1).Which is:x¬≥ + x¬≤ - x¬≤ - 3x - 1 = 6x¬≤ + 6x.Simplifying left side:x¬≥ - 3x - 1.Right side: 6x¬≤ + 6x.Bringing all terms to left:x¬≥ - 6x¬≤ - 9x - 1 = 0.Yes, that seems correct. So, I have a cubic equation: x¬≥ - 6x¬≤ - 9x - 1 = 0.Cubic equations can be tricky. Maybe I can try to factor it or find rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem says that any rational root p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -1 and leading coefficient is 1, so possible rational roots are ¬±1.Let me test x=1:1 - 6 - 9 - 1 = 1 - 6 - 9 - 1 = -15 ‚â† 0.x=-1:-1 - 6 + 9 - 1 = 1 ‚â† 0.So, no rational roots. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe I need to use the cubic formula or numerical methods, but that seems beyond the scope of this problem. Perhaps there's a different approach.Wait, maybe instead of trying to find a‚ÇÅ, I can look for a pattern in the sequence. The recursive formula is a_{n+1} = -1/(a_n + 1). Let's see if the sequence is periodic.Let me compute the first few terms in terms of a‚ÇÅ:a‚ÇÅ = x,a‚ÇÇ = -1/(x + 1),a‚ÇÉ = -1/(a‚ÇÇ + 1) = -1/(-1/(x + 1) + 1) = -1/[( -1 + x + 1 )/(x + 1)] = -1/(x/(x + 1)) = -(x + 1)/x.a‚ÇÑ = -1/(a‚ÇÉ + 1) = -1/(-(x + 1)/x + 1) = -1/[ (-x -1 + x)/x ] = -1/(-1/x) = x.Wait, a‚ÇÑ = x, which is a‚ÇÅ. So, the sequence repeats every 3 terms. That means it's periodic with period 3. So, a‚ÇÑ = a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÖ = a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÜ = a‚ÇÉ, and so on.Therefore, the sequence cycles every three terms. So, to find a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ, a‚ÇÅ‚Çá, a‚ÇÅ‚Çà, I can find their positions in the cycle.Let me see: since the period is 3, I can divide the term number by 3 and find the remainder.16 divided by 3 is 5 with a remainder of 1. So, a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ = a‚ÇÅ.17 divided by 3 is 5 with a remainder of 2. So, a‚ÇÅ‚Çá = a‚ÇÇ.18 divided by 3 is 6 with a remainder of 0, which would correspond to a‚ÇÉ. So, a‚ÇÅ‚Çà = a‚ÇÉ.Therefore, a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ + a‚ÇÅ‚Çá + a‚ÇÅ‚Çà = a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇ + a‚ÇÉ = 6.Wow, so I didn't even need to solve for a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÉ individually. Recognizing the periodicity of the sequence made this much simpler. That was a bit of a detour trying to solve the cubic equation, but realizing the sequence repeats every three terms was key.So, the answer is 6."},{"question":"From the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, two different digits are selected to be the coordinates of a point in the Cartesian coordinate system. The number of points that can be determined not lying on the x-axis is ( )A: 100  B: 90  C: 81  D: 72","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: From the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, two different digits are selected to be the coordinates of a point in the Cartesian coordinate system. The question is asking for the number of points that can be determined not lying on the x-axis, and the options are A: 100, B: 90, C: 81, D: 72.Alright, let me try to break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. We have digits from 0 to 9, and we're selecting two different digits. These two digits will be the x and y coordinates of a point in the Cartesian plane. So, essentially, we're forming ordered pairs (x, y) where x and y are different digits from 0 to 9.Now, the key part is that the point should not lie on the x-axis. In the Cartesian coordinate system, a point lies on the x-axis if its y-coordinate is 0. So, to ensure the point doesn't lie on the x-axis, the y-coordinate must be something other than 0. That means y can be 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 9.Let me think about how many possible points there are in total without any restrictions. If we're selecting two different digits for x and y, how many ordered pairs can we form? Well, for the x-coordinate, we can choose any digit from 0 to 9, so that's 10 choices. For the y-coordinate, since it has to be different from x, we have 9 remaining choices. So, the total number of points is 10 * 9 = 90.But wait, the problem specifies that the point should not lie on the x-axis. So, we need to exclude all the points where y = 0. How many such points are there? Well, if y must be 0, then x can be any digit from 0 to 9, but since x and y have to be different, x can't be 0 in this case. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.If y is 0, then x can be any digit from 1 to 9 because x and y have to be different. So, actually, there are 9 points where y = 0: (1,0), (2,0), ..., (9,0). So, we need to subtract these 9 points from the total of 90 to get the number of points not lying on the x-axis. That would give us 90 - 9 = 81 points.Hmm, but let me double-check that. Another way to approach this is to consider the y-coordinate first. Since y can't be 0, we have 9 choices for y (1 through 9). For each of these y values, x can be any digit from 0 to 9 except y itself. So, for each y, there are 9 choices for x. Therefore, the total number of points is 9 * 9 = 81. That seems consistent with my earlier calculation.Wait, but hold on a second. If y can't be 0, and x can be 0, but x and y have to be different. So, for each y (1-9), x can be 0 or any digit except y. That's 9 choices for x, as I thought. So, 9 * 9 = 81. That seems right.But let me think about another angle. If we consider all possible ordered pairs where x and y are different digits, that's 10 * 9 = 90. Out of these, how many lie on the x-axis? As I thought earlier, it's when y = 0, and x can be 1-9, so 9 points. So, subtracting those gives 90 - 9 = 81. Yep, that matches.Is there another way someone might approach this problem and get a different answer? Maybe if they considered that x can't be 0 as well? But the problem doesn't say anything about x being non-zero, only that the point shouldn't lie on the x-axis, which only restricts y. So, x can be 0, as long as y isn't 0. So, points like (0,1), (0,2), etc., are valid and should be counted.Another possible mistake could be if someone thought that both x and y have to be non-zero, but that's not the case. The only restriction is that y can't be zero. So, x can be zero, but y can't. So, points where x is zero but y is non-zero are still valid and should be included.Wait, but in the initial total of 90 points, does that include points where x is zero? Yes, because x can be zero, and y can be any digit except zero. So, for x = 0, y can be 1-9, which is 9 points. Similarly, for x = 1, y can be 0-9 except 1, which is 9 points, and so on. So, the total is indeed 90.So, subtracting the 9 points where y = 0 gives us 81, which is option C. That seems to be the correct answer.But just to make sure, let me think about how many points lie on the x-axis. As I said, it's when y = 0, and x can be 1-9, so 9 points. So, total points not on the x-axis would be total points minus points on the x-axis, which is 90 - 9 = 81.Alternatively, if I think about it as choosing y first, since y can't be zero, there are 9 choices for y. For each y, x can be any digit except y, so 9 choices for x. So, 9 * 9 = 81.Yes, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 81, which is option C.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any overlap or something I'm missing. For example, are there any points where both x and y are zero? Well, no, because the problem says two different digits, so x and y can't both be zero. So, (0,0) is not allowed, but since y can't be zero anyway, that point isn't even in our consideration.Also, are there any other restrictions? The problem just says two different digits, so as long as x and y are different, regardless of their values, except that y can't be zero. So, I think my reasoning holds.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 81, which is option C."},{"question":"Given four positive integers ( m, n, p, q ), such that ( p < m ) and ( q < n ). In the Cartesian plane, consider four points ( A(0,0) ), ( B(p, 0) ), ( C(m, q) ), and ( D(m, n) ). We are interested in paths ( f ) from ( A ) to ( D ) and paths ( g ) from ( B ) to ( C ). Both ( f ) and ( g ) are only allowed to move in the positive direction along coordinate axes and can only change direction at integer coordinate points (from one positive direction axis to another).Let ( S ) be the number of pairs of paths ( (f, g) ) such that ( f ) and ( g ) do not share any common points. Prove that:S=C_{m+n}^{m} C_{m+q-p}^{q}-C_{m+q}^{m} C_{m+n-p}^{n} .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of pairs of paths from A to D and from B to C such that these paths don't share any common points. The points are given as A(0,0), B(p,0), C(m,q), and D(m,n). Both paths can only move in the positive direction along the coordinate axes and can only change direction at integer points. First, I need to understand what these paths look like. Since both paths can only move right or up, the number of paths from A to D should be the number of ways to arrange m right moves and n up moves. Similarly, the number of paths from B to C should be the number of ways to arrange (m - p) right moves and q up moves. So, the total number of paths from A to D is C(m+n, m), which is the binomial coefficient. Similarly, the number of paths from B to C is C((m-p)+q, q). Therefore, the total number of pairs of paths without any restrictions is C(m+n, m) * C(m+q-p, q). But the problem asks for the number of pairs where the paths do not share any common points. So, I need to subtract the number of pairs where the paths intersect or share a common point. How do I count the number of intersecting pairs? Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That is, total pairs minus the intersecting pairs will give me the non-intersecting pairs. To find the number of intersecting pairs, perhaps I can consider the paths that intersect at some point. If two paths intersect at a point K, then I can think of the paths as going from A to K and then K to D for path f, and from B to K and then K to C for path g. But wait, if I fix an intersection point K, how do I count the number of such paths? It seems complicated because K can be any point along the paths. Maybe there's a smarter way to count the intersecting pairs without fixing K. I remember something about the principle of reflection or maybe the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. Maybe I can model this as two paths that cross each other, and then use some kind of transformation to count them. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as two separate path counts and then find a relationship between them. Let me try to visualize the grid. Point A is at the origin, B is somewhere along the x-axis, C is somewhere along the line x = m, and D is at (m, n). If I consider the paths from A to D and from B to C, they can potentially intersect somewhere in the grid. To ensure they don't intersect, I need to make sure that one path is always above or below the other, or to the left or right. Wait, maybe I can use the concept of non-intersecting lattice paths. I think there's a formula for that, something involving binomial coefficients and subtracting the intersecting cases. Let me recall the formula for non-intersecting paths. If we have two paths, one from A to D and another from B to C, the number of non-intersecting pairs is equal to the total number of pairs minus the number of intersecting pairs. So, S = total pairs - intersecting pairs. I already have the total pairs as C(m+n, m) * C(m+q-p, q). Now, I need to find the number of intersecting pairs. How do I compute the number of intersecting pairs? Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or some combinatorial argument. I think there's a way to transform the problem by swapping parts of the paths after an intersection point. This might allow me to count the intersecting pairs by relating them to another set of paths. Suppose two paths intersect at some point K. Then, if I swap the segments of the two paths after K, I might end up with a different pair of paths that can be counted in another way. Let me try to formalize this. Suppose path f goes from A to D and path g goes from B to C. If they intersect at point K, then we can split each path into two parts: from the start to K, and from K to the end. If I swap the segments from K to D and K to C, then path f would go from A to K to C, and path g would go from B to K to D. But wait, does this transformation always work? Let me check. If I swap the segments, then the new path f' goes from A to K to C, and the new path g' goes from B to K to D. But the original paths were from A to D and B to C, so after swapping, f' is from A to C and g' is from B to D. So, the number of intersecting pairs is equal to the number of pairs of paths from A to C and from B to D. Therefore, the number of intersecting pairs is C(m+q, m) * C(m+n-p, n). Wait, let me verify this. The number of paths from A to C is C(m+q, m), since we need to make m right moves and q up moves. Similarly, the number of paths from B to D is C(m+n-p, n), since we need to make (m - p) right moves and n up moves. So, if I swap the segments after the intersection point, each intersecting pair corresponds uniquely to a pair of paths from A to C and from B to D. Therefore, the number of intersecting pairs is indeed C(m+q, m) * C(m+n-p, n). Therefore, the number of non-intersecting pairs S is equal to the total number of pairs minus the number of intersecting pairs, which is:S = C(m+n, m) * C(m+q-p, q) - C(m+q, m) * C(m+n-p, n)So, that's the formula I was supposed to prove. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of pairs of paths is the product of the number of paths from A to D and from B to C. The number of intersecting pairs is the product of the number of paths from A to C and from B to D, because of the swapping argument. Therefore, subtracting the intersecting pairs from the total gives the number of non-intersecting pairs. I think this makes sense. The key idea was to realize that intersecting pairs can be transformed into pairs of paths from A to C and B to D, which allows us to count them using binomial coefficients. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning, so I think the proof is correct."},{"question":"Can ( x ), ( frac{14x + 5}{9} ), and ( frac{17x - 5}{12} ) all be integers at the same time?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if ( x ), ( frac{14x + 5}{9} ), and ( frac{17x - 5}{12} ) can all be integers at the same time. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I know that for ( frac{14x + 5}{9} ) to be an integer, the numerator ( 14x + 5 ) must be divisible by 9. Similarly, for ( frac{17x - 5}{12} ) to be an integer, ( 17x - 5 ) must be divisible by 12. So, I need to find an integer ( x ) that satisfies both these divisibility conditions.Let me start with the first condition: ( 14x + 5 ) is divisible by 9. That means ( 14x + 5 equiv 0 pmod{9} ). Simplifying this congruence, I can subtract 5 from both sides: ( 14x equiv -5 pmod{9} ). Since 14 is equivalent to 5 modulo 9 (because 14 - 9 = 5), I can rewrite this as ( 5x equiv -5 pmod{9} ).Now, to solve for ( x ), I need to find the modular inverse of 5 modulo 9. The inverse of 5 modulo 9 is a number ( y ) such that ( 5y equiv 1 pmod{9} ). Trying out numbers, I find that ( y = 2 ) because ( 5 times 2 = 10 equiv 1 pmod{9} ). So, multiplying both sides of ( 5x equiv -5 pmod{9} ) by 2 gives ( x equiv -10 pmod{9} ). Simplifying ( -10 ) modulo 9, I get ( x equiv -1 pmod{9} ), which is the same as ( x equiv 8 pmod{9} ).So, ( x ) must be of the form ( x = 9k + 8 ) for some integer ( k ).Next, let's look at the second condition: ( 17x - 5 ) is divisible by 12. This translates to ( 17x - 5 equiv 0 pmod{12} ). Simplifying, I add 5 to both sides: ( 17x equiv 5 pmod{12} ). Since 17 is equivalent to 5 modulo 12 (because 17 - 12 = 5), this becomes ( 5x equiv 5 pmod{12} ).To solve for ( x ), I can divide both sides by 5, but I need to make sure that 5 has an inverse modulo 12. Since 5 and 12 are coprime, the inverse exists. The inverse of 5 modulo 12 is a number ( z ) such that ( 5z equiv 1 pmod{12} ). Testing values, I find that ( z = 5 ) because ( 5 times 5 = 25 equiv 1 pmod{12} ). Multiplying both sides of ( 5x equiv 5 pmod{12} ) by 5 gives ( x equiv 25 pmod{12} ), which simplifies to ( x equiv 1 pmod{12} ).So, ( x ) must also be of the form ( x = 12m + 1 ) for some integer ( m ).Now, I have two expressions for ( x ):1. ( x = 9k + 8 )2. ( x = 12m + 1 )To find a common ( x ) that satisfies both, I set them equal to each other:[ 9k + 8 = 12m + 1 ]Simplifying, I get:[ 9k - 12m = -7 ]This is a linear Diophantine equation. To solve it, I can look for integer solutions ( k ) and ( m ).First, I'll simplify the equation by dividing through by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9 and 12, which is 3. However, dividing -7 by 3 doesn't give an integer, which suggests there might be no solution. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's rearrange the equation:[ 9k = 12m - 7 ]This means that ( 9k ) must be equal to ( 12m - 7 ). Since 9k is divisible by 3, ( 12m - 7 ) must also be divisible by 3. Let's check:[ 12m equiv 0 pmod{3} ]So,[ 12m - 7 equiv -7 pmod{3} ][ -7 equiv 2 pmod{3} ]But 2 is not congruent to 0 modulo 3, which means ( 12m - 7 ) is not divisible by 3. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for ( k ) and ( m ) that satisfy the equation.This implies that there is no integer ( x ) that makes both ( frac{14x + 5}{9} ) and ( frac{17x - 5}{12} ) integers at the same time. Therefore, it's impossible for all three expressions ( x ), ( frac{14x + 5}{9} ), and ( frac{17x - 5}{12} ) to be integers simultaneously.I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work to make sure there are no mistakes. It seems like the conclusion is solid."},{"question":"A cistern can be filled by three pipes: pipe A in 12 hours, pipe B in 15 hours, and pipe C in 20 hours. The full cistern can be leaked out by two exhaust pipes: pipe D in 18 hours and pipe E in 24 hours. If all the pipes are opened at the same time, in what time will the cistern be full?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a cistern being filled and emptied by various pipes. Let me try to understand it step by step. First, there are three pipes that can fill the cistern: Pipe A, Pipe B, and Pipe C. Pipe A can fill the cistern in 12 hours, Pipe B in 15 hours, and Pipe C in 20 hours. Then, there are two exhaust pipes, Pipe D and Pipe E, which can empty the cistern. Pipe D empties it in 18 hours, and Pipe E in 24 hours. The question is, if all these pipes are opened at the same time, how long will it take for the cistern to be full?Alright, so I think the key here is to figure out the rates at which each pipe fills or empties the cistern and then combine them to find the net rate. Once I have the net rate, I can find out how long it takes to fill the cistern.Let me start by recalling that if a pipe can fill a cistern in 'x' hours, its filling rate is 1/x per hour. Similarly, if an exhaust pipe can empty the cistern in 'y' hours, its emptying rate is 1/y per hour. But since it's emptying, I guess I should consider it as a negative rate.So, for the filling pipes:- Pipe A fills at a rate of 1/12 per hour.- Pipe B fills at a rate of 1/15 per hour.- Pipe C fills at a rate of 1/20 per hour.For the exhaust pipes:- Pipe D empties at a rate of -1/18 per hour.- Pipe E empties at a rate of -1/24 per hour.Now, to find the net rate when all pipes are open, I need to add up all these rates:Net rate = (1/12) + (1/15) + (1/20) - (1/18) - (1/24)Hmm, adding these fractions. I need a common denominator to add them properly. Let me see, the denominators are 12, 15, 20, 18, and 24. What's the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers? Let me break them down:- 12 = 2^2 * 3- 15 = 3 * 5- 20 = 2^2 * 5- 18 = 2 * 3^2- 24 = 2^3 * 3So, the LCM would be the highest power of each prime number present:- 2^3, 3^2, and 5^1. So, 8 * 9 * 5 = 360.Okay, so 360 is the least common multiple. Now, let's convert each fraction to have 360 as the denominator.- 1/12 = 30/360- 1/15 = 24/360- 1/20 = 18/360- 1/18 = 20/360- 1/24 = 15/360So, plugging these back into the net rate equation:Net rate = 30/360 + 24/360 + 18/360 - 20/360 - 15/360Now, let's add and subtract these numerators:30 + 24 + 18 = 7272 - 20 - 15 = 37So, the net rate is 37/360 per hour.This means that every hour, the cistern is being filled at a rate of 37/360 of its capacity.To find out how long it takes to fill the cistern completely, I need to divide the total capacity (which is 1 cistern) by the net rate:Time = 1 / (37/360) = 360/37 hoursCalculating that, 360 divided by 37 is approximately 9.73 hours.So, if all the pipes are opened at the same time, the cistern will be full in about 9.73 hours.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, the rates:- Pipe A: 1/12 ‚âà 0.0833- Pipe B: 1/15 ‚âà 0.0667- Pipe C: 1/20 = 0.05- Pipe D: -1/18 ‚âà -0.0556- Pipe E: -1/24 ‚âà -0.0417Adding these up:0.0833 + 0.0667 + 0.05 - 0.0556 - 0.0417 ‚âà 0.0833 + 0.0667 = 0.15; 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.2; 0.2 - 0.0556 = 0.1444; 0.1444 - 0.0417 ‚âà 0.1027So, the net rate is approximately 0.1027 per hour.Then, time = 1 / 0.1027 ‚âà 9.73 hours.Yes, that seems consistent. So, my initial calculation was correct.Therefore, the cistern will be full in approximately 9.73 hours when all pipes are opened simultaneously."},{"question":"Simplify: (2a^{2}-3ab+8)-(-ab-a^{2}+8).","answer":"First, I observe the original expression: ( (2a^{2} - 3ab + 8) - (-ab - a^{2} + 8) ).To simplify this, I need to distribute the negative sign across the terms inside the second parenthesis. This means changing the sign of each term within the second parenthesis.After distributing the negative sign, the expression becomes: ( 2a^{2} - 3ab + 8 + ab + a^{2} - 8 ).Next, I combine like terms. The ( a^{2} ) terms are ( 2a^{2} ) and ( a^{2} ), which add up to ( 3a^{2} ). The ( ab ) terms are ( -3ab ) and ( ab ), which combine to ( -2ab ). The constant terms ( 8 ) and ( -8 ) cancel each other out.Putting it all together, the simplified expression is ( 3a^{2} - 2ab )."},{"question":"Two circles of different radii touch each other externally. Find the angle determined by the chords connecting the point of tangency of the circles with the points of tangency of their common external tangent.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here: there are two circles with different radii that touch each other externally. I need to find the angle determined by the chords connecting the point of tangency of the circles with the points of tangency of their common external tangent. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to visualize it.First, let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. There are two circles, one bigger and one smaller, touching each other at a single point. Let's call that point of tangency C. Now, they have a common external tangent, which is a line that touches both circles without crossing between them. Let me denote the points where this external tangent touches the circles as A and B. So, A is the point of tangency on the first circle, and B is the point on the second circle.Now, the problem is asking about the angle determined by the chords connecting C with A and B. So, essentially, I need to find the angle at point C between the two chords CA and CB. That angle is what I need to find.Let me recall some properties of circles and tangents. When two circles touch externally, the point of tangency lies on the line connecting their centers. Also, the common external tangent will be parallel to the line connecting the centers if the circles are congruent, but since they have different radii, that's not the case here. However, the lengths from the external tangent points to the point of tangency might have some relation.Wait, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, if I consider point D where the external tangent meets the line connecting the centers, then DA and DB should be equal? Hmm, no, actually, point D is not necessarily on the line connecting the centers. Maybe I'm confusing something.Let me think again. The external tangent touches both circles at A and B. The point C is where the two circles touch each other. So, I have chords CA and CB. The angle at C between these two chords is what I need to find.Maybe I can use some triangle properties here. Let me consider triangle CAB. Wait, no, that's not necessarily a triangle because A and B are on different circles. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider triangles involving the centers of the circles.Let me denote the centers of the two circles as O1 and O2. Since the circles touch externally, the distance between O1 and O2 is equal to the sum of their radii, say r1 and r2. So, O1O2 = r1 + r2.Now, the external tangent AB is tangent to both circles, so O1A is perpendicular to AB, and O2B is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, O1A and O2B are both radii perpendicular to the same tangent line, which means they are parallel to each other.So, O1A is parallel to O2B. That might help in forming some similar triangles or something.Also, since O1A and O2B are both perpendicular to AB, the quadrilateral O1AO2B is a trapezoid with O1A parallel to O2B.Wait, maybe I can consider the triangle formed by O1, O2, and the point where the external tangent meets the line connecting the centers. Let me see.Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to model this problem. Let me place the two circles on a coordinate plane to make things clearer.Let me assume that the first circle, with center O1, is at (0,0), and the second circle, with center O2, is at (d,0), where d is the distance between the centers, which is r1 + r2. So, O1 is at (0,0), O2 is at (d,0), and the point of tangency C is somewhere along the line connecting O1 and O2.Since the circles touch externally, point C lies on the line O1O2, and the distance from O1 to C is r1, and from O2 to C is r2. So, C is at (r1, 0) from O1, but since O2 is at (d,0), which is (r1 + r2, 0), then C is at (r1,0).Wait, no, that can't be right because if O1 is at (0,0) and O2 is at (d,0), then point C is at (r1,0), which is also (d - r2,0). So, that makes sense because d = r1 + r2, so r1 = d - r2.Now, the external tangent AB touches the first circle at A and the second circle at B. Let me find the coordinates of points A and B.Since AB is a common external tangent, the line AB is tangent to both circles. The slope of AB can be found using the formula for the slope of a common external tangent.The slope m of the external tangent can be found using similar triangles. The distance between the centers is d = r1 + r2, and the difference in radii is r1 - r2. Wait, no, for external tangents, the formula is a bit different.Actually, for two circles with centers separated by distance d, the length of the external tangent is sqrt(d^2 - (r1 + r2)^2). Wait, no, that's for internal tangents. Let me recall.Wait, no, the length of the external tangent is sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2). Yes, that's correct. Because for external tangents, the radii are effectively subtracted when considering the right triangle formed by the centers and the points of tangency.So, the length of the external tangent AB is sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2). But I need the coordinates of A and B.Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the tangent line. Let me suppose that the external tangent has equation y = mx + c. Since it is tangent to both circles, the distance from O1 to the line must be equal to r1, and the distance from O2 to the line must be equal to r2.The distance from a point (x0,y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). In our case, the line is y = mx + c, which can be rewritten as mx - y + c = 0. So, a = m, b = -1, c = c.Therefore, the distance from O1(0,0) to the line is |0 + 0 + c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = |c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = r1.Similarly, the distance from O2(d,0) to the line is |m*d - 0 + c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = |m*d + c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = r2.So, we have two equations:1. |c| = r1 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)2. |m*d + c| = r2 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)Since the tangent is external, the signs of c and m*d + c should be the same. Let's assume c is positive, so we can drop the absolute value:1. c = r1 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)2. m*d + c = r2 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)Substituting c from the first equation into the second:m*d + r1 * sqrt(m^2 + 1) = r2 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)Let me rearrange this:m*d = (r2 - r1) * sqrt(m^2 + 1)Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:m^2 * d^2 = (r2 - r1)^2 * (m^2 + 1)Expanding the right side:m^2 * d^2 = (r2 - r1)^2 * m^2 + (r2 - r1)^2Bring all terms to one side:m^2 * d^2 - (r2 - r1)^2 * m^2 - (r2 - r1)^2 = 0Factor m^2:m^2 [d^2 - (r2 - r1)^2] - (r2 - r1)^2 = 0Let me denote k = (r2 - r1)^2 for simplicity:m^2 [d^2 - k] - k = 0So,m^2 = k / (d^2 - k)Substituting back k = (r2 - r1)^2:m^2 = (r2 - r1)^2 / (d^2 - (r2 - r1)^2)But d = r1 + r2, so let's substitute that:m^2 = (r2 - r1)^2 / [(r1 + r2)^2 - (r2 - r1)^2]Let me compute the denominator:(r1 + r2)^2 - (r2 - r1)^2 = [r1^2 + 2 r1 r2 + r2^2] - [r1^2 - 2 r1 r2 + r2^2] = 4 r1 r2So,m^2 = (r2 - r1)^2 / (4 r1 r2)Therefore,m = (r2 - r1) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2))Since we assumed c positive, and depending on the configuration, m could be positive or negative. But since we're dealing with external tangents above the x-axis, let's take m positive if r2 > r1, otherwise negative. But for simplicity, let's just keep it as m = (r2 - r1) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)).Now, let's compute c:c = r1 * sqrt(m^2 + 1) = r1 * sqrt( (r2 - r1)^2 / (4 r1 r2) + 1 )Simplify inside the square root:= sqrt( (r2 - r1)^2 / (4 r1 r2) + 1 )= sqrt( (r2^2 - 2 r1 r2 + r1^2) / (4 r1 r2) + 1 )= sqrt( (r1^2 + r2^2 - 2 r1 r2) / (4 r1 r2) + 1 )= sqrt( (r1^2 + r2^2 - 2 r1 r2 + 4 r1 r2) / (4 r1 r2) )= sqrt( (r1^2 + r2^2 + 2 r1 r2) / (4 r1 r2) )= sqrt( (r1 + r2)^2 / (4 r1 r2) )= (r1 + r2) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2))Therefore,c = r1 * (r1 + r2) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) = [r1 (r1 + r2)] / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) = [sqrt(r1) (r1 + r2)] / (2 sqrt(r2)) = (r1 + r2) / (2) * sqrt(r1 / r2)Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can express it differently.Alternatively, let me write c as:c = r1 * sqrt(m^2 + 1) = r1 * sqrt( (r2 - r1)^2 / (4 r1 r2) + 1 )But I think I already did that.Anyway, now that I have m and c, I can write the equation of the external tangent AB as y = mx + c.Now, points A and B lie on this tangent line and are points of tangency on their respective circles.Let me find the coordinates of A and B.For point A on the first circle centered at O1(0,0):The tangent line at A is y = mx + c, and the radius O1A is perpendicular to this tangent. Therefore, the slope of O1A is -1/m.Since O1A has slope -1/m and passes through (0,0), its equation is y = (-1/m) x.Point A lies on both the tangent line and the radius line, so solving:y = mx + cy = (-1/m) xSet equal:mx + c = (-1/m) xMultiply both sides by m:m^2 x + c m = -xBring terms with x to one side:m^2 x + x = -c mx (m^2 + 1) = -c mTherefore,x = -c m / (m^2 + 1)Similarly, y = (-1/m) x = (-1/m) * (-c m / (m^2 + 1)) = c / (m^2 + 1)So, point A has coordinates:A = ( -c m / (m^2 + 1), c / (m^2 + 1) )Similarly, for point B on the second circle centered at O2(d,0):The tangent line at B is y = mx + c, and the radius O2B is perpendicular to this tangent. Therefore, the slope of O2B is -1/m.Since O2 is at (d,0), the equation of O2B is y = (-1/m)(x - d)Point B lies on both the tangent line and the radius line, so solving:y = mx + cy = (-1/m)(x - d)Set equal:mx + c = (-1/m)(x - d)Multiply both sides by m:m^2 x + c m = -x + dBring terms with x to one side:m^2 x + x = d - c mx (m^2 + 1) = d - c mTherefore,x = (d - c m) / (m^2 + 1)Similarly, y = mx + c = m * (d - c m)/(m^2 + 1) + c= [m d - c m^2 + c (m^2 + 1)] / (m^2 + 1)= [m d - c m^2 + c m^2 + c] / (m^2 + 1)= (m d + c) / (m^2 + 1)So, point B has coordinates:B = ( (d - c m)/(m^2 + 1), (m d + c)/(m^2 + 1) )Now, I have coordinates for points A, B, and C.Point C is the point where the two circles touch each other, which we established earlier is at (r1, 0) or equivalently (d - r2, 0). Since d = r1 + r2, point C is at (r1, 0).So, point C is at (r1, 0).Now, I need to find the angle at point C between chords CA and CB.To find this angle, I can use the dot product formula. If I have vectors CA and CB, the angle between them can be found using:cos(theta) = (CA ¬∑ CB) / (|CA| |CB|)First, let's find vectors CA and CB.Vector CA = A - C = ( -c m / (m^2 + 1) - r1, c / (m^2 + 1) - 0 ) = ( (-c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) / (m^2 + 1), c / (m^2 + 1) )Similarly, vector CB = B - C = ( (d - c m)/(m^2 + 1) - r1, (m d + c)/(m^2 + 1) - 0 ) = ( (d - c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) / (m^2 + 1), (m d + c)/(m^2 + 1) )This is getting quite involved. Maybe there's a simpler way.Alternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, and C, we can compute the vectors CA and CB and then compute the angle between them.But before I proceed, let me see if there's a geometric property or theorem that can help me find this angle without getting bogged down in coordinates.I remember that when two circles touch externally, the angle between the common external tangent and the line connecting the centers is equal to the angle between the radii at the points of tangency.Wait, actually, the angle between the tangent and the radius is 90 degrees, since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent.So, at point A, O1A is perpendicular to AB, and at point B, O2B is perpendicular to AB.Therefore, triangles O1AC and O2BC are right triangles.Wait, but point C is the point where the two circles touch, so O1C is a radius of the first circle, and O2C is a radius of the second circle. Since the circles touch externally, O1C + O2C = O1O2.Wait, no, O1C is r1, O2C is r2, and O1O2 = r1 + r2.So, O1, C, and O2 are colinear, with C lying between O1 and O2.Now, considering triangles O1AC and O2BC, both are right triangles with right angles at A and B respectively.Perhaps I can use some trigonometric relations here.Let me consider triangle O1AC. It is a right triangle with sides O1A = r1, AC, and O1C = r1.Wait, no, O1C is the distance from O1 to C, which is r1, and O1A is also r1, so triangle O1AC is an isosceles right triangle? Wait, no, because AC is not necessarily equal to O1C.Wait, no, O1A is perpendicular to AB, and AC is a chord from A to C.Hmm, maybe I need to find the lengths of CA and CB.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines in triangle ACB.Wait, but I don't know the lengths of AC and BC yet.Alternatively, maybe I can find the coordinates and compute the vectors.Let me try that approach.Given that point C is at (r1, 0), point A is at ( -c m / (m^2 + 1), c / (m^2 + 1) ), and point B is at ( (d - c m)/(m^2 + 1), (m d + c)/(m^2 + 1) ).So, vector CA is A - C = ( -c m / (m^2 + 1) - r1, c / (m^2 + 1) - 0 ) = ( (-c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) / (m^2 + 1), c / (m^2 + 1) )Similarly, vector CB is B - C = ( (d - c m)/(m^2 + 1) - r1, (m d + c)/(m^2 + 1) - 0 ) = ( (d - c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) / (m^2 + 1), (m d + c)/(m^2 + 1) )Now, let's compute the dot product of vectors CA and CB.Dot product = [ (-c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) / (m^2 + 1) ] * [ (d - c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) / (m^2 + 1) ] + [ c / (m^2 + 1) ] * [ (m d + c)/(m^2 + 1) ]This is quite complex, but let's try to simplify step by step.First, let's compute the x-components:Term1 = [ (-c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) / (m^2 + 1) ] * [ (d - c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) / (m^2 + 1) ]Let me denote numerator1 = (-c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) and numerator2 = (d - c m - r1 (m^2 + 1))So,Term1 = (numerator1 * numerator2) / (m^2 + 1)^2Similarly, the y-components:Term2 = [ c / (m^2 + 1) ] * [ (m d + c)/(m^2 + 1) ] = c (m d + c) / (m^2 + 1)^2So, the total dot product is (numerator1 * numerator2 + c (m d + c)) / (m^2 + 1)^2Now, let's compute numerator1 * numerator2:= (-c m - r1 (m^2 + 1)) * (d - c m - r1 (m^2 + 1))Let me expand this:= (-c m)(d) + (-c m)(-c m) + (-c m)(-r1 (m^2 + 1)) + (-r1 (m^2 + 1))(d) + (-r1 (m^2 + 1))(-c m) + (-r1 (m^2 + 1))(-r1 (m^2 + 1))Simplify term by term:1. (-c m)(d) = -c m d2. (-c m)(-c m) = c^2 m^23. (-c m)(-r1 (m^2 + 1)) = c m r1 (m^2 + 1)4. (-r1 (m^2 + 1))(d) = -r1 d (m^2 + 1)5. (-r1 (m^2 + 1))(-c m) = c m r1 (m^2 + 1)6. (-r1 (m^2 + 1))(-r1 (m^2 + 1)) = r1^2 (m^2 + 1)^2So, combining all these:= -c m d + c^2 m^2 + c m r1 (m^2 + 1) - r1 d (m^2 + 1) + c m r1 (m^2 + 1) + r1^2 (m^2 + 1)^2Now, let's collect like terms:- Terms with c m d: -c m d- Terms with c^2 m^2: c^2 m^2- Terms with c m r1 (m^2 + 1): c m r1 (m^2 + 1) + c m r1 (m^2 + 1) = 2 c m r1 (m^2 + 1)- Terms with -r1 d (m^2 + 1): -r1 d (m^2 + 1)- Terms with r1^2 (m^2 + 1)^2: r1^2 (m^2 + 1)^2So, numerator1 * numerator2 = -c m d + c^2 m^2 + 2 c m r1 (m^2 + 1) - r1 d (m^2 + 1) + r1^2 (m^2 + 1)^2Now, let's compute c (m d + c):= c m d + c^2So, numerator1 * numerator2 + c (m d + c) = [ -c m d + c^2 m^2 + 2 c m r1 (m^2 + 1) - r1 d (m^2 + 1) + r1^2 (m^2 + 1)^2 ] + [ c m d + c^2 ]Simplify:- The -c m d and +c m d cancel out.- c^2 m^2 + c^2 = c^2 (m^2 + 1)- 2 c m r1 (m^2 + 1) remains- -r1 d (m^2 + 1) remains- r1^2 (m^2 + 1)^2 remainsSo, total becomes:c^2 (m^2 + 1) + 2 c m r1 (m^2 + 1) - r1 d (m^2 + 1) + r1^2 (m^2 + 1)^2Factor out (m^2 + 1):= (m^2 + 1) [ c^2 + 2 c m r1 - r1 d + r1^2 (m^2 + 1) ]Now, let's substitute the values of c and m that we found earlier.Recall:m = (r2 - r1) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2))c = r1 * sqrt(m^2 + 1) = r1 * sqrt( (r2 - r1)^2 / (4 r1 r2) + 1 )Earlier, we found that sqrt(m^2 + 1) = (r1 + r2) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2))Therefore, c = r1 * (r1 + r2) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) = [ r1 (r1 + r2) ] / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) = [ sqrt(r1) (r1 + r2) ] / (2 sqrt(r2)) = (r1 + r2) / (2) * sqrt(r1 / r2)But let's keep it as c = r1 * (r1 + r2) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) for substitution.Also, d = r1 + r2.So, let's substitute c and d into the expression:(m^2 + 1) [ c^2 + 2 c m r1 - r1 d + r1^2 (m^2 + 1) ]First, compute c^2:c^2 = [ r1 (r1 + r2) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) ]^2 = r1^2 (r1 + r2)^2 / (4 r1 r2) = r1 (r1 + r2)^2 / (4 r2)Next, compute 2 c m r1:2 c m r1 = 2 * [ r1 (r1 + r2) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) ] * [ (r2 - r1) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) ] * r1Simplify:= 2 * [ r1 (r1 + r2) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) ] * [ (r2 - r1) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) ] * r1= [ r1 (r1 + r2) / sqrt(r1 r2) ] * [ (r2 - r1) / (2 sqrt(r1 r2)) ] * r1= [ r1^2 (r1 + r2) (r2 - r1) ] / (2 r1 r2 )= [ r1 (r1 + r2) (r2 - r1) ] / (2 r2 )= [ r1 (r2^2 - r1^2) ] / (2 r2 )Next, compute -r1 d:= -r1 (r1 + r2)Next, compute r1^2 (m^2 + 1):We already have m^2 + 1 = (r2 - r1)^2 / (4 r1 r2) + 1 = [ (r2 - r1)^2 + 4 r1 r2 ] / (4 r1 r2 ) = (r2^2 - 2 r1 r2 + r1^2 + 4 r1 r2 ) / (4 r1 r2 ) = (r1^2 + 2 r1 r2 + r2^2 ) / (4 r1 r2 ) = (r1 + r2)^2 / (4 r1 r2 )Therefore, r1^2 (m^2 + 1) = r1^2 * (r1 + r2)^2 / (4 r1 r2 ) = r1 (r1 + r2)^2 / (4 r2 )Now, putting it all together:c^2 + 2 c m r1 - r1 d + r1^2 (m^2 + 1 ) = [ r1 (r1 + r2)^2 / (4 r2 ) ] + [ r1 (r2^2 - r1^2 ) / (2 r2 ) ] - r1 (r1 + r2 ) + [ r1 (r1 + r2 )^2 / (4 r2 ) ]Let me compute each term:1. [ r1 (r1 + r2)^2 / (4 r2 ) ]2. [ r1 (r2^2 - r1^2 ) / (2 r2 ) ]3. - r1 (r1 + r2 )4. [ r1 (r1 + r2 )^2 / (4 r2 ) ]Combine terms 1 and 4:= 2 * [ r1 (r1 + r2 )^2 / (4 r2 ) ] = [ r1 (r1 + r2 )^2 / (2 r2 ) ]Now, term 2:= [ r1 (r2^2 - r1^2 ) / (2 r2 ) ]Term 3:= - r1 (r1 + r2 )So, total expression:= [ r1 (r1 + r2 )^2 / (2 r2 ) ] + [ r1 (r2^2 - r1^2 ) / (2 r2 ) ] - r1 (r1 + r2 )Let me factor out r1 / (2 r2 ):= r1 / (2 r2 ) [ (r1 + r2 )^2 + (r2^2 - r1^2 ) ] - r1 (r1 + r2 )Compute inside the brackets:= (r1 + r2 )^2 + (r2^2 - r1^2 ) = r1^2 + 2 r1 r2 + r2^2 + r2^2 - r1^2 = 2 r2^2 + 2 r1 r2Therefore,= r1 / (2 r2 ) * (2 r2^2 + 2 r1 r2 ) - r1 (r1 + r2 )Simplify:= r1 / (2 r2 ) * 2 r2 (r2 + r1 ) - r1 (r1 + r2 )= r1 (r2 + r1 ) - r1 (r1 + r2 ) = 0Wait, that's interesting. So, the entire expression inside the brackets becomes zero.Therefore, numerator1 * numerator2 + c (m d + c ) = (m^2 + 1 ) * 0 = 0So, the dot product of vectors CA and CB is zero.That means the vectors CA and CB are perpendicular to each other.Therefore, the angle between them is 90 degrees.Wow, that's a neat result. So, regardless of the radii of the circles, as long as they touch externally, the angle determined by the chords connecting the point of tangency with the points of tangency of their common external tangent is a right angle.I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.We set up the problem with coordinates, found the equations of the tangent and the points of tangency, computed the vectors, and through a lot of algebra, found that the dot product is zero, implying a right angle. It seems consistent.Alternatively, is there a more straightforward geometric proof without coordinates?Let me think. Since the tangent is common, and the radii are perpendicular to the tangent, the lines O1A and O2B are both perpendicular to AB, hence parallel to each other.Therefore, quadrilateral O1AO2B is a trapezoid with O1A || O2B.Now, since O1, C, O2 are colinear, and C is the point of tangency, we can consider triangles O1AC and O2BC.But I'm not sure if that directly leads to the angle at C being 90 degrees.Alternatively, since O1A and O2B are both perpendicular to AB, and O1C and O2C are radii, perhaps there's some cyclic quadrilateral property or something.Wait, if I consider quadrilateral O1ACB, but I don't think it's cyclic.Alternatively, maybe using homothety. The point C is the external homothety center of the two circles, which maps one circle to the other. The external tangent AB is mapped to itself, so the lines AC and BC are mapped to each other, implying some angle relations.But I think the coordinate approach, although lengthy, confirmed that the angle is 90 degrees.So, I'm confident that the angle is 90 degrees.**Final Answer**The angle determined by the chords is boxed{90^circ}."},{"question":"Perry made a recipe that serves four people. He created a sauce using a specific ratio of 3:2:1 of cream, cheese, and butter. Cream has 88 grams of fat per cup, cheese contains 110 grams of fat per cup, and butter has 184 grams of fat per cup. For the whole recipe, Perry used a total of one cup of the mixture of these ingredients. How many grams of fat were added to each serving of food?","answer":"First, I need to determine how much of each ingredient Perry used based on the ratio 3:2:1. The total parts of the ratio are 3 (cream) + 2 (cheese) + 1 (butter) = 6 parts.Since Perry used a total of one cup of the mixture, I can calculate the amount of each ingredient as follows:- Cream: (3/6) * 1 cup = 1/2 cup- Cheese: (2/6) * 1 cup = 1/3 cup- Butter: (1/6) * 1 cup = 1/6 cupNext, I'll calculate the grams of fat from each ingredient:- Cream: 1/2 cup * 88 grams of fat = 44 grams of fat- Cheese: 1/3 cup * 110 grams of fat = 36.67 grams of fat (approximately)- Butter: 1/6 cup * 184 grams of fat = 30.67 grams of fat (approximately)Adding these together gives the total grams of fat in the sauce:Total fat = 44 + 36.67 + 30.67 = 111.34 grams of fat (approximately)Since the recipe serves four people, I'll divide the total grams of fat by 4 to find the grams of fat per serving:Fat per serving = 111.34 grams / 4 = 27.835 grams of fat per serving (approximately)So, each serving of food has approximately 27.84 grams of fat added from the sauce."},{"question":"For which ( k ) does the system of equations [ x^2 - y^2 = 0 ][ (x - k)^2 + y^2 = 1 ]have exactly (1) two, and (2) three real solutions?","answer":"Okay, so I have this system of equations:1. ( x^2 - y^2 = 0 )2. ( (x - k)^2 + y^2 = 1 )And I need to find for which values of ( k ) this system has exactly two real solutions and exactly three real solutions. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, looking at the first equation, ( x^2 - y^2 = 0 ). I remember that this can be factored as ( (x - y)(x + y) = 0 ), which means either ( x = y ) or ( x = -y ). So, the solutions to the first equation are the lines ( y = x ) and ( y = -x ).Now, the second equation is ( (x - k)^2 + y^2 = 1 ). That looks like the equation of a circle with center at ( (k, 0) ) and radius 1. So, we're looking for the points where this circle intersects the lines ( y = x ) and ( y = -x ).Since the system is asking for real solutions, we need to find the points where the circle intersects these two lines. Depending on the value of ( k ), the circle can intersect each line in 0, 1, or 2 points. Therefore, the total number of solutions can vary.Let me consider each case separately.**Case 1: ( y = x )**Substituting ( y = x ) into the second equation:( (x - k)^2 + x^2 = 1 )Let me expand this:( (x^2 - 2kx + k^2) + x^2 = 1 )Combine like terms:( 2x^2 - 2kx + k^2 - 1 = 0 )So, this is a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ). Let me write it as:( 2x^2 - 2kx + (k^2 - 1) = 0 )To find real solutions, the discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative. The discriminant ( D ) is given by:( D = b^2 - 4ac )Here, ( a = 2 ), ( b = -2k ), and ( c = k^2 - 1 ). Plugging these in:( D = (-2k)^2 - 4 * 2 * (k^2 - 1) )Simplify:( D = 4k^2 - 8(k^2 - 1) )( D = 4k^2 - 8k^2 + 8 )( D = -4k^2 + 8 )So, ( D = 8 - 4k^2 ). For real solutions, ( D geq 0 ):( 8 - 4k^2 geq 0 )( 8 geq 4k^2 )( 2 geq k^2 )( |k| leq sqrt{2} )So, when ( |k| leq sqrt{2} ), the line ( y = x ) intersects the circle in real points. If ( |k| > sqrt{2} ), there are no real intersections.**Case 2: ( y = -x )**Similarly, substituting ( y = -x ) into the second equation:( (x - k)^2 + (-x)^2 = 1 )Simplify:( (x - k)^2 + x^2 = 1 )Which is the same equation as in Case 1! So, this substitution leads to the same quadratic equation:( 2x^2 - 2kx + (k^2 - 1) = 0 )Therefore, the analysis is identical. The discriminant is ( D = 8 - 4k^2 ), so the same condition ( |k| leq sqrt{2} ) applies.So, for both lines ( y = x ) and ( y = -x ), the circle intersects them if ( |k| leq sqrt{2} ). Now, let's think about how many intersection points we can have.Each line can intersect the circle in 0, 1, or 2 points. Since both lines are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the number of intersections for each line will be the same.So, if ( |k| < sqrt{2} ), each line intersects the circle in two distinct points, giving a total of 4 solutions. If ( |k| = sqrt{2} ), each line is tangent to the circle, giving exactly one intersection point per line, totaling 2 solutions.Wait, but the problem asks for exactly two and three real solutions. So, how do we get three solutions?Hmm, maybe when one of the lines intersects the circle at the origin, which is a common point for both lines. Let me check.If ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 0 ), does this satisfy both equations?First equation: ( 0 - 0 = 0 ), yes.Second equation: ( (0 - k)^2 + 0^2 = k^2 ). For this to equal 1, ( k^2 = 1 ), so ( k = pm 1 ).So, when ( k = pm 1 ), the circle passes through the origin, which is the intersection point of the lines ( y = x ) and ( y = -x ). Therefore, in this case, the origin is a common solution for both lines.So, for ( k = pm 1 ), the circle intersects each line ( y = x ) and ( y = -x ) at two points each, but one of those points is the origin, which is shared. Therefore, instead of having four distinct solutions, we have three distinct solutions: the origin and two other points.Let me verify this.For ( k = 1 ):Substitute ( k = 1 ) into the quadratic equation:( 2x^2 - 2(1)x + (1 - 1) = 0 )( 2x^2 - 2x = 0 )( 2x(x - 1) = 0 )So, ( x = 0 ) or ( x = 1 ).For ( x = 0 ), ( y = 0 ) (from both lines).For ( x = 1 ), ( y = 1 ) or ( y = -1 ).So, the solutions are ( (0, 0) ), ( (1, 1) ), and ( (1, -1) ). That's three solutions.Similarly, for ( k = -1 ), the solutions would be ( (0, 0) ), ( (-1, 1) ), and ( (-1, -1) ). Again, three solutions.Therefore, when ( k = pm 1 ), the system has exactly three real solutions.Putting it all together:- When ( |k| = sqrt{2} ), the circle is tangent to both lines, giving exactly two solutions.- When ( |k| = 1 ), the circle passes through the origin, resulting in exactly three solutions.- For other values of ( k ) within ( |k| < sqrt{2} ) but ( |k| neq 1 ), the system has four solutions.- For ( |k| > sqrt{2} ), there are no real solutions.But the problem specifically asks for exactly two and exactly three real solutions. So, the values of ( k ) are:1. Exactly two real solutions: ( k = pm sqrt{2} )2. Exactly three real solutions: ( k = pm 1 )I think that's it. Let me just double-check if there are any other cases where the number of solutions could be different. For example, could there be a case where one line intersects the circle twice and the other line doesn't intersect at all? But since both lines are symmetric and the circle is centered on the x-axis, if one line intersects, the other should too, unless the circle is too far left or right. But we've already considered the discriminant condition, which shows that for ( |k| leq sqrt{2} ), both lines intersect the circle.Therefore, I'm confident with the conclusion."},{"question":"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} with the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n, if frac{a_8}{a_4} = 2 and S_4 = 4, then the value of S_8 is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says that the sum of the first n terms is denoted as S_n. It gives me two pieces of information: the ratio of the 8th term to the 4th term is 2, and the sum of the first 4 terms is 4. I need to find the sum of the first 8 terms, S_8.Okay, let's recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as q. So, the nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as a_n = a_1 * q^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term.The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula S_n = a_1 * (1 - q^n) / (1 - q), provided that q is not equal to 1. If q is 1, then the sum is just n * a_1, but since the ratio of terms is given as 2, q can't be 1 here.Alright, so let's write down what we know:1. a_8 / a_4 = 22. S_4 = 4Let me express a_8 and a_4 using the formula for the nth term.a_8 = a_1 * q^(8-1) = a_1 * q^7a_4 = a_1 * q^(4-1) = a_1 * q^3So, the ratio a_8 / a_4 is (a_1 * q^7) / (a_1 * q^3). The a_1 terms cancel out, so we get q^(7-3) = q^4. Given that a_8 / a_4 = 2, this means q^4 = 2. So, q is the fourth root of 2. Hmm, that's approximately 1.1892, but maybe I don't need to calculate it numerically right now. I can just keep it as q^4 = 2.Now, moving on to the sum of the first 4 terms, S_4 = 4.Using the sum formula:S_4 = a_1 * (1 - q^4) / (1 - q) = 4But we already know that q^4 = 2, so let's substitute that in:S_4 = a_1 * (1 - 2) / (1 - q) = 4Simplify the numerator:1 - 2 = -1, so:S_4 = a_1 * (-1) / (1 - q) = 4Which simplifies to:- a_1 / (1 - q) = 4Let me solve for a_1:Multiply both sides by (1 - q):- a_1 = 4 * (1 - q)Then, multiply both sides by -1:a_1 = -4 * (1 - q)So, a_1 is expressed in terms of q. Now, I need to find S_8.Using the sum formula again:S_8 = a_1 * (1 - q^8) / (1 - q)We already know that q^4 = 2, so q^8 is (q^4)^2 = 2^2 = 4.So, substituting q^8 = 4 into the formula:S_8 = a_1 * (1 - 4) / (1 - q) = a_1 * (-3) / (1 - q)But we have an expression for a_1 in terms of q: a_1 = -4*(1 - q). Let's substitute that in:S_8 = (-4*(1 - q)) * (-3) / (1 - q)Let me simplify this step by step.First, multiply the numerators:(-4*(1 - q)) * (-3) = (-4)*(-3)*(1 - q) = 12*(1 - q)So now, we have:S_8 = 12*(1 - q) / (1 - q)Wait, the (1 - q) terms in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, as long as (1 - q) is not zero. Since q is the fourth root of 2, which is approximately 1.1892, 1 - q is negative but not zero. So, we can safely cancel them.Therefore, S_8 = 12.Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I found that q^4 = 2 from the ratio of a_8 to a_4. That seems correct.2. Then, I used the sum formula for S_4 and substituted q^4 = 2, leading to a_1 = -4*(1 - q). That also seems correct.3. For S_8, I used the sum formula again, substituted q^8 = 4, and then substituted a_1. The (1 - q) terms canceled out, leaving me with 12.Yes, that all checks out. So, I think the value of S_8 is 12.**Final Answer**The value of ( S_8 ) is boxed{12}."},{"question":"Circle  omega_1  and  omega_2  have centers  (0,6)  and  (20,0) , respectively.

They intersect at two points, X and Y, and I need to find the equation of the line passing through these two points. Then, I have to compute 100m + b, where the line is written as y = mx + b.Alright, let's start by writing down the equations of both circles.For œâ‚ÇÅ, the center is (0,6) and the radius is 30. So, the equation should be:x¬≤ + (y - 6)¬≤ = 30¬≤Which simplifies to:x¬≤ + (y - 6)¬≤ = 900Similarly, for œâ‚ÇÇ, the center is (20,0) and the radius is also 30. So, its equation is:(x - 20)¬≤ + y¬≤ = 30¬≤Which simplifies to:(x - 20)¬≤ + y¬≤ = 900Now, since both circles intersect at points X and Y, the line passing through these two points is actually the radical axis of the two circles. I remember that the radical axis can be found by subtracting the equations of the two circles.So, let's subtract the equation of œâ‚ÇÇ from œâ‚ÇÅ.First, write both equations:1. x¬≤ + (y - 6)¬≤ = 9002. (x - 20)¬≤ + y¬≤ = 900Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:x¬≤ + (y - 6)¬≤ - [(x - 20)¬≤ + y¬≤] = 900 - 900Simplify the left-hand side:x¬≤ + (y¬≤ - 12y + 36) - [x¬≤ - 40x + 400 + y¬≤] = 0Let me expand each term step by step.First, expand (y - 6)¬≤:(y - 6)¬≤ = y¬≤ - 12y + 36Then, expand (x - 20)¬≤:(x - 20)¬≤ = x¬≤ - 40x + 400So, substituting back into the equation:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 12y + 36 - (x¬≤ - 40x + 400 + y¬≤) = 0Now distribute the negative sign inside the parentheses:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 12y + 36 - x¬≤ + 40x - 400 - y¬≤ = 0Now, let's combine like terms:x¬≤ - x¬≤ cancels out.y¬≤ - y¬≤ cancels out.So, we're left with:-12y + 36 + 40x - 400 = 0Combine constants and terms:40x - 12y - 364 = 0Hmm, that's the equation we get after subtracting. So, this is the equation of the radical axis, which is the line passing through points X and Y.But we need to write it in the form y = mx + b. So, let's solve for y.Starting with:40x - 12y - 364 = 0Let's move the 40x and the -364 to the other side:-12y = -40x + 364Now, divide both sides by -12 to solve for y:y = (-40x + 364)/(-12)Simplify the fractions:First, let's factor out the numerator:-40x + 364 = -40x + 364Divide numerator and denominator by -4 to simplify:(-40x)/(-12) = (40x)/12 = (10x)/3364/(-12) = -364/12Simplify 364 divided by 12:364 √∑ 4 = 91, and 12 √∑ 4 = 3, so 364/12 = 91/3So, putting it together:y = (10/3)x - 91/3So, the equation of the line is y = (10/3)x - 91/3.Therefore, m is 10/3 and b is -91/3.Now, the problem asks for 100m + b.Compute 100m + b:100*(10/3) + (-91/3) = (1000/3) - (91/3) = (1000 - 91)/3 = 909/3Simplify 909 divided by 3:909 √∑ 3 = 303So, 100m + b = 303.I think that's the answer.

Solving for y: Yes, got y = (10/3)x - 91/3.5. Calculating 100m + b: 100*(10/3) = 1000/3, and b is -91/3, so 1000/3 - 91/3 = 909/3 = 303.Looks good.

Let me try to break it down step by step. First, the equation given is (2x^3 - px^2 + qx - d = 0). I know that for polynomials, especially cubic ones, Vieta's formulas are really helpful. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since this is a cubic equation, there are three roots, let's call them (x_1), (x_2), and (x_3).Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0) tell us that:1. The sum of the roots (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -frac{b}{a}).2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time (x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3 = frac{c}{a}).3. The product of the roots (x_1x_2x_3 = -frac{d}{a}).In our equation, the coefficients are a bit different because the leading coefficient isn't 1. Let me rewrite the equation to match the standard form:[2x^3 - px^2 + qx - d = 0]So, comparing this to the standard form (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0), we can see that:- (a = 2)- (b = -p)- (c = q)- (d = -d) (Wait, that seems confusing. Let me double-check.)Hold on, in the standard form, the constant term is (d), but in our equation, the constant term is (-d). So actually, the constant term is (-d), which means in the standard form, (d_{text{standard}} = -d_{text{given}}). Hmm, that might be important later.But for now, focusing on the sum of the roots. Using Vieta's formula, the sum (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -frac{b}{a}). Substituting the values from our equation:[x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -frac{-p}{2} = frac{p}{2}]Wait, that seems straightforward. So the sum of the roots is (frac{p}{2}). But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.The problem also mentions that (q = 2d). I wonder if that affects the sum of the roots. Let me think. The sum of the roots depends only on the coefficients (a) and (b), right? So (q) and (d) are related, but since we're only asked about the sum, which is determined by (a) and (b), maybe the relationship between (q) and (d) isn't directly relevant here.But just to be thorough, let's see what else Vieta's formulas tell us. The sum of the products two at a time is (frac{c}{a}), which in our case is (frac{q}{2}). And the product of the roots is (-frac{d_{text{standard}}}{a}), which would be (-frac{-d}{2} = frac{d}{2}).So, we have:1. (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = frac{p}{2})2. (x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3 = frac{q}{2})3. (x_1x_2x_3 = frac{d}{2})Given that (q = 2d), substituting into the second equation gives:[x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3 = frac{2d}{2} = d]So, the sum of the products two at a time is equal to (d). But since the problem is only asking for the sum of the roots, which we've already determined is (frac{p}{2}), I think that's the answer.Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in interpreting the coefficients. The original equation is (2x^3 - px^2 + qx - d = 0). So, in standard form, it's:[2x^3 + (-p)x^2 + qx + (-d) = 0]Therefore, (a = 2), (b = -p), (c = q), and (d_{text{standard}} = -d). So, applying Vieta's formula for the sum:[x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -frac{b}{a} = -frac{-p}{2} = frac{p}{2}]Yep, that looks correct. So, despite the relationship between (q) and (d), it doesn't affect the sum of the roots. Therefore, the answer should be (frac{p}{2}), which corresponds to option A.I think I've covered all the bases here. I applied Vieta's formula correctly, checked the coefficients, considered the given relationship between (q) and (d), and confirmed that it doesn't impact the sum of the roots. So, I'm confident that the answer is (frac{p}{2})."},{"question":"To address the difficulty people face in accessing healthcare, the health department decided to significantly reduce the price of a commonly used medication.

The transformation rule is to take each pair of adjacent elements, multiply them, and form a new quadruple. So, from (a, b, c, d), we get (ab, bc, cd, da). The question is asking to prove that we can never return to the original quadruple unless all elements are 1.Hmm, okay. So, first, let's try to understand what happens when we apply this transformation multiple times. Maybe I can compute a few transformations manually to see if I notice a pattern.Let's say we start with Q‚ÇÄ = (a, b, c, d). After one transformation, Q‚ÇÅ = (ab, bc, cd, da). After another transformation, Q‚ÇÇ would be:- First element: (ab)(bc) = ab¬≤c- Second element: (bc)(cd) = bc¬≤d- Third element: (cd)(da) = c d¬≤ a- Fourth element: (da)(ab) = d a¬≤ bSo, Q‚ÇÇ = (ab¬≤c, bc¬≤d, c d¬≤ a, d a¬≤ b). Hmm, interesting.

Let's compute that.For Q‚ÇÄ, the product is a * b * c * d. For Q‚ÇÅ, it's ab * bc * cd * da. Let's compute that:(ab)(bc)(cd)(da) = a b * b c * c d * d a = a¬≤ b¬≤ c¬≤ d¬≤ = (a b c d)¬≤.So, the product of the elements in Q‚ÇÅ is the square of the product of the elements in Q‚ÇÄ. Similarly, if we compute the product for Q‚ÇÇ, it would be (ab¬≤c)(bc¬≤d)(c d¬≤ a)(d a¬≤ b). Let's compute that:ab¬≤c * bc¬≤d * c d¬≤ a * d a¬≤ b = a * b¬≤ * c * b * c¬≤ * d * c * d¬≤ * a * d * a¬≤ * b.Let me count the exponents:- a: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4- b: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4- c: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4- d: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4So, the product is a‚Å¥ b‚Å¥ c‚Å¥ d‚Å¥ = (a b c d)‚Å¥.Wait, so each time we apply the transformation, the product of the elements gets squared. So, starting from Q‚ÇÄ, the product is P‚ÇÄ = a b c d. Then, Q‚ÇÅ has product P‚ÇÅ = P‚ÇÄ¬≤, Q‚ÇÇ has product P‚ÇÇ = P‚ÇÅ¬≤ = P‚ÇÄ‚Å¥, Q‚ÇÉ has product P‚ÇÉ = P‚ÇÇ¬≤ = P‚ÇÄ‚Å∏, and so on. So, in general, after k transformations, the product is P_k = P‚ÇÄ^{2^k}.Now, suppose we start with some quadruple Q‚ÇÄ and after some number of transformations, say k, we get back to Q‚ÇÄ. That would mean that Q_k = Q‚ÇÄ. But then, the product of Q_k would be equal to the product of Q‚ÇÄ. So, P_k = P‚ÇÄ. But we just saw that P_k = P‚ÇÄ^{2^k}. Therefore, P‚ÇÄ^{2^k} = P‚ÇÄ.Assuming P‚ÇÄ ‚â† 0 (since all elements are positive reals), we can divide both sides by P‚ÇÄ, getting P‚ÇÄ^{2^k - 1} = 1. Since P‚ÇÄ is a positive real, the only way this can happen is if P‚ÇÄ = 1. So, the product of the original quadruple must be 1.But the question is asking to prove that we can never return to the original quadruple unless a = b = c = d = 1. So, even if the product is 1, does that necessarily mean that all elements are 1?Hmm, not necessarily. For example, if a = 2, b = 1/2, c = 2, d = 1/2, then the product is 2 * 1/2 * 2 * 1/2 = 1. But clearly, the quadruple isn't (1,1,1,1). So, maybe there's more to it.Wait, but maybe the transformation has some other properties that force the elements to be equal if we return to the original quadruple. Let me think.Suppose we have Q_k = Q‚ÇÄ. Then, each element of Q_k must be equal to the corresponding element of Q‚ÇÄ. So, for example, the first element of Q_k is equal to a, the second to b, and so on.But from the transformation, each element of Q_{n+1} is the product of two adjacent elements of Q_n. So, if Q_k = Q‚ÇÄ, then:- a = (some product involving elements of Q_{k-1})- b = (some product involving elements of Q_{k-1})- etc.This seems recursive and might lead to some system of equations. Maybe I can write down these equations.Let me denote Q_{k-1} as (w, x, y, z). Then, Q_k = (wx, xy, yz, zw). And we want Q_k = (a, b, c, d). So:1. wx = a2. xy = b3. yz = c4. zw = dNow, we have four equations:1. wx = a2. xy = b3. yz = c4. zw = dWe can try to solve for w, x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, d.From equation 1: w = a / xFrom equation 2: y = b / xFrom equation 3: z = c / y = c / (b / x) = (c x) / bFrom equation 4: zw = d => z * w = dSubstitute z and w from above:(c x / b) * (a / x) = dSimplify:(c x / b) * (a / x) = (c a) / b = dSo, (c a) / b = d => c a = b dSo, we get a relationship between a, b, c, d: c a = b d.Similarly, we can try to find other relationships.From equation 1: w = a / xFrom equation 2: y = b / xFrom equation 3: z = c / y = c / (b / x) = (c x) / bFrom equation 4: zw = d => (c x / b) * (a / x) = (c a) / b = dSo, we have c a = b d.Similarly, let's see if we can find more relationships.From equation 1: wx = aFrom equation 2: xy = bDivide equation 2 by equation 1: (xy)/(wx) = b/a => y/w = b/a => y = (b/a) wSimilarly, from equation 3: yz = cFrom equation 4: zw = dDivide equation 4 by equation 3: (zw)/(yz) = d/c => w/y = d/c => w = (d/c) yBut we already have y = (b/a) w, so substituting:w = (d/c) * (b/a) w => w = (b d)/(a c) wAssuming w ‚â† 0 (which it isn't, since all elements are positive reals), we can divide both sides by w:1 = (b d)/(a c) => a c = b dWhich is the same as before.So, the only condition we get is a c = b d.But in our initial quadruple, we have a c = b d. So, if we start with a quadruple where a c = b d, then it's possible that after one transformation, we get back to the original quadruple? Wait, no, because we have Q‚ÇÅ = (ab, bc, cd, da). For Q‚ÇÅ to equal Q‚ÇÄ, we need:ab = abc = bcd = cda = dSo, let's write these equations:1. ab = a => b = 1 (since a ‚â† 0)2. bc = b => c = 1 (since b ‚â† 0)3. cd = c => d = 1 (since c ‚â† 0)4. da = d => a = 1 (since d ‚â† 0)So, the only solution is a = b = c = d = 1.Therefore, if we start with a quadruple where a = b = c = d = 1, then applying the transformation will keep it the same. But if we start with any other quadruple, even if a c = b d, we won't get back to the original quadruple.Wait, but earlier we saw that if a c = b d, then Q‚ÇÅ would satisfy certain conditions, but it doesn't necessarily mean Q‚ÇÅ = Q‚ÇÄ unless all elements are 1.So, putting it all together, the only way to return to the original quadruple is if all elements are 1. Otherwise, the product of the elements keeps increasing (or decreasing) exponentially, and you can't cycle back.Therefore, part (a) is proved.Now, moving on to part (b): Given n is a power of 2, and an n-tuple (a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ..., a_n) where each a_i is either 1 or -1. The transformation is to take each pair of adjacent elements, multiply them, and form a new n-tuple, with the last element being a_n a‚ÇÅ. We need to prove that after sufficiently many transformations, all elements become 1.Hmm, okay. So, let's think about what happens when we apply this transformation. Each element in the new tuple is the product of two adjacent elements in the original tuple.Since each a_i is either 1 or -1, their product is also either 1 or -1. So, the transformation preserves the property that all elements are 1 or -1.Now, let's consider what happens after multiple transformations. Maybe we can analyze the behavior of the tuple over time.Let me try with a small n, say n=2, which is a power of 2.For n=2, the tuple is (a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ). The transformation gives (a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÇa‚ÇÅ) = (a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ). So, after one transformation, both elements become the same. If we apply the transformation again, we get ( (a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ)^2, (a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ)^2 ) = (1,1). So, in two transformations, we get all 1s.Okay, that works for n=2.What about n=4? Let's see.Let‚Äôs denote the tuple as (a, b, c, d). The transformation gives (ab, bc, cd, da). Let's apply it again:First transformation: (ab, bc, cd, da)Second transformation: (ab * bc, bc * cd, cd * da, da * ab) = (a b¬≤ c, b c¬≤ d, c d¬≤ a, d a¬≤ b)Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should think in terms of exponents or something else.Wait, another approach: Since n is a power of 2, maybe we can use induction. Suppose it's true for n=2^k, then prove it for n=2^{k+1}.But I'm not sure how to set that up yet.Alternatively, maybe consider the number of -1s in the tuple. Each transformation might reduce the number of -1s in some way.Wait, let's think about the product of all elements. Initially, the product is P = a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ...a_n. After one transformation, the new product is (a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ)(a‚ÇÇa‚ÇÉ)...(a_n a‚ÇÅ) = (a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ...a_n)^2 = P¬≤.So, similar to part (a), the product of the tuple squares each time. But since each a_i is ¬±1, the product P is also ¬±1. So, P¬≤ = 1. Therefore, after one transformation, the product becomes 1.Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of the initial product, after one transformation, the product becomes 1. So, all tuples after the first transformation have a product of 1.But we need to show that after sufficiently many transformations, all elements become 1.Hmm, so maybe the product being 1 is a necessary condition, but not sufficient. We need more.Let me think about the structure of the transformations. Each element is the product of two adjacent elements. So, it's like a kind of convolution or something.Wait, maybe I can represent the transformations as a matrix. Since each new element is a product of two old elements, it's a kind of linear transformation in the multiplicative sense.But since we're dealing with multiplicative transformations, maybe it's better to take logarithms, but since the elements are ¬±1, taking logarithms would complicate things because log(-1) isn't real.Alternatively, maybe think in terms of exponents modulo 2, since multiplying by -1 is equivalent to adding 1 modulo 2 in the exponent if we represent -1 as e^{iœÄ}.Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Let's think differently.Suppose we represent each -1 as 1 and 1 as 0 in some binary sense. Then, multiplying two elements would correspond to adding their binary representations modulo 2.But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Wait, another idea: Since n is a power of 2, maybe after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, something nice happens.Let me try with n=4.Start with (a, b, c, d). After one transformation: (ab, bc, cd, da). After two transformations: (ab*bc, bc*cd, cd*da, da*ab) = (a b¬≤ c, b c¬≤ d, c d¬≤ a, d a¬≤ b). After three transformations: Each element is the product of two elements from the previous step.Wait, this seems messy. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, let's consider the transformation as a kind of shift register. Each element is influenced by its neighbors. Since n is a power of 2, maybe after n transformations, the influence has propagated around the entire tuple.Alternatively, think about the transformation as a linear operator over the field of two elements, but since we're dealing with multiplicative operations, it's not straightforward.Wait, another thought: Since each transformation squares the product, and after one transformation, the product is 1, maybe after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, all elements become 1.But I need to make this more precise.Wait, let's think about the number of -1s. Each transformation could potentially reduce the number of -1s.But how? Let's see.Suppose we have a tuple with some number of -1s. After one transformation, each element is the product of two adjacent elements. So, if two adjacent elements are both -1, their product is 1. If one is -1 and the other is 1, their product is -1. If both are 1, their product is 1.So, the number of -1s in the new tuple depends on the number of adjacent pairs where exactly one element is -1.Hmm, so if we have a run of k consecutive -1s, how does that affect the next transformation?Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the positions of -1s.Alternatively, consider that each transformation is a kind of \\"diffusion\\" of the -1s. Maybe after enough transformations, the -1s cancel out.Wait, another idea: Since n is a power of 2, the transformation can be seen as a kind of binary operation that eventually leads to all elements being 1.Wait, maybe using induction on the number of transformations.Base case: n=1. Trivially, it's already 1.n=2: As we saw earlier, after two transformations, we get all 1s.Assume it's true for n=2^k. Now, consider n=2^{k+1}. Maybe we can split the tuple into two halves, each of size 2^k, and apply the induction hypothesis.But I'm not sure how the transformation interacts with splitting the tuple.Wait, another approach: Since each transformation squares the product, and after one transformation, the product is 1, maybe after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, all elements become 1.But I need to make this rigorous.Alternatively, think about the transformation as a kind of Fourier transform or something similar, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe consider the exponents of -1. Since each element is either 1 or -1, we can represent each element as (-1)^{x_i}, where x_i is 0 or 1.Then, the transformation becomes:New element = (-1)^{x_i + x_{i+1}}.So, the new tuple is ( (-1)^{x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ}, (-1)^{x‚ÇÇ + x‚ÇÉ}, ..., (-1)^{x_n + x‚ÇÅ} ).If we take the logarithm (in the multiplicative sense), we get:New x'_i = x_i + x_{i+1} mod 2.So, the transformation on the exponents is linear over GF(2).Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that after sufficiently many applications of this linear transformation, all x_i become 0.But since we're working over GF(2), the transformation is a linear operator, and we can analyze its properties.The transformation matrix is a circulant matrix where each row has 1s in positions corresponding to the neighbors.Since n is a power of 2, the eigenvalues of this matrix can be computed, and perhaps the transformation is nilpotent or something similar.Wait, but actually, since the transformation is linear, we can represent it as a matrix and analyze its behavior.Let me denote the transformation matrix as T, where T is a circulant matrix with 1s on the superdiagonal and 1s on the subdiagonal, and also a 1 in the top-right and bottom-left corners.Wait, no, actually, each element is the sum of two adjacent elements, so the matrix would have 1s on the main diagonal shifted by one, but actually, in terms of the exponents, it's a linear combination.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Alternatively, since the transformation is linear over GF(2), and n is a power of 2, the transformation matrix is likely to have a certain structure that allows us to conclude that after enough transformations, we reach the zero vector.But I'm not sure about the exact properties.Wait, another idea: Since each transformation is equivalent to adding each element to its neighbor, in GF(2), this is similar to a cellular automaton rule.In particular, it's similar to Rule 102 or something, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, think about the transformation as a kind of shift register where each bit is the sum of two adjacent bits.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe consider that after n transformations, each element has been influenced by all other elements, due to the cyclic nature.Since n is a power of 2, after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, the influence has propagated around the entire tuple.But I'm not sure how to formalize this.Wait, maybe think about the binary representation of the positions. Since n is a power of 2, each position can be represented with log‚ÇÇ(n) bits. Each transformation could correspond to a bit shift or something.Alternatively, think about the transformation as a kind of binary convolution.Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.Wait, let's think about the number of -1s. Each transformation could potentially reduce the number of -1s or keep it the same.But how?Suppose we have a tuple with an even number of -1s. Then, after one transformation, the number of -1s could be different.Wait, actually, the number of -1s can increase or decrease depending on the arrangement.Wait, maybe consider that the transformation is a kind of parity check. Each new element is the product of two elements, which is equivalent to the XOR of their exponents.So, if we represent each -1 as 1 and 1 as 0, then the transformation is equivalent to adding adjacent bits modulo 2.So, the problem reduces to: Starting with a binary vector, apply the transformation where each bit is the sum of two adjacent bits modulo 2, and show that after enough transformations, all bits become 0.This is a linear transformation over GF(2), and we can analyze its behavior.The key is to show that the transformation is nilpotent, meaning that some power of it is the zero transformation.But I'm not sure if it's nilpotent. Alternatively, maybe the transformation has a certain period, but since we're working over GF(2), it might eventually reach the zero vector.Wait, actually, since the transformation is linear, we can represent it as a matrix and find its eigenvalues. If all eigenvalues are zero, then it's nilpotent.But I'm not sure about the eigenvalues of this specific matrix.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that n is a power of 2, and the transformation matrix has a certain structure that allows us to conclude that after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, we reach the zero vector.Wait, another idea: Since each transformation is a kind of \\"diffusion\\" of the bits, and n is a power of 2, after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, each bit has been influenced by all other bits, leading to cancellation.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe consider that the transformation is similar to a binary shift register, and after n transformations, the state repeats. But since we're working over GF(2), and n is a power of 2, maybe the period divides n, but I'm not sure.Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.Wait, let's think about the transformation as a kind of binary matrix multiplication. Each transformation is equivalent to multiplying by a certain matrix. If we can show that this matrix raised to some power is the identity matrix, then we can conclude that after that many transformations, we return to the original state. But we need to show that we reach the all-ones state, not necessarily the original state.Wait, but since the product after one transformation is 1, and we need to reach all 1s, maybe after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, we get there.Wait, another idea: Since each transformation squares the product, and after one transformation, the product is 1, maybe after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, all elements become 1.But I need to make this precise.Wait, let's think about the exponents again. If we represent each element as (-1)^{x_i}, then the transformation is x'_i = x_i + x_{i+1} mod 2.So, the transformation is linear, and we can represent it as a matrix. Let's denote this matrix as M.Then, after k transformations, the state is M^k x, where x is the initial vector.We need to show that for some k, M^k x = 0 for all x.But actually, we need to show that for any initial x, M^k x = 0.This would mean that M is nilpotent, i.e., M^k = 0 for some k.But is M nilpotent?Wait, M is a circulant matrix with 1s on the superdiagonal and 1s on the subdiagonal, and also a 1 in the top-right and bottom-left corners.Wait, actually, no. The transformation is x'_i = x_i + x_{i+1} mod 2, with indices modulo n.So, the matrix M has 1s on the main diagonal and the superdiagonal, and also a 1 in the bottom-left corner.Wait, no, actually, each row has 1s in positions i and i+1, modulo n.So, for example, for n=4, M would be:[1 1 0 00 1 1 00 0 1 11 0 0 1]Wait, no, actually, each row corresponds to x'_i = x_i + x_{i+1}.So, for row i, the 1s are in columns i and i+1 (mod n).So, for n=4, M would be:Row 1: 1 1 0 0Row 2: 0 1 1 0Row 3: 0 0 1 1Row 4: 1 0 0 1Yes, that's correct.Now, to check if M is nilpotent, we need to see if some power of M is the zero matrix.But nilpotent matrices have all eigenvalues equal to zero. Let's compute the eigenvalues of M.The eigenvalues of a circulant matrix can be computed using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the first row.The first row of M is [1, 1, 0, ..., 0], with 1s in the first two positions.The eigenvalues are given by Œª_j = c_0 + c_1 œâ^j + c_2 œâ^{2j} + ... + c_{n-1} œâ^{(n-1)j}, where œâ = e^{2œÄi/n} and c_k are the entries of the first row.In our case, c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1, and c_k = 0 for k ‚â• 2.So, Œª_j = 1 + œâ^j.We need to check if any Œª_j = 0, which would imply that M is singular, but not necessarily nilpotent.But for M to be nilpotent, all eigenvalues must be zero, which is not the case here since Œª_j = 1 + œâ^j.For n=4, œâ = i, so Œª_j = 1 + i^j.For j=0: Œª_0 = 1 + 1 = 2j=1: Œª_1 = 1 + ij=2: Œª_2 = 1 + (-1) = 0j=3: Œª_3 = 1 + (-i)So, for n=4, M has eigenvalues 2, 1+i, 0, 1-i.Since one eigenvalue is zero, M is singular, but not nilpotent because not all eigenvalues are zero.Wait, but in our case, we're working over GF(2), so maybe the eigenvalues are different.Wait, no, the eigenvalues are still in the complex field, regardless of the field we're working over.Hmm, this approach might not be helpful.Wait, maybe instead of looking at eigenvalues, think about the order of the matrix M. If M has finite order, then some power of M is the identity matrix.But we need to reach the zero vector, not the identity.Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach.Wait, another idea: Since n is a power of 2, and the transformation is linear, maybe the transformation can be decomposed into smaller transformations on subsets of the tuple.For example, for n=4, maybe we can split the tuple into two pairs and analyze their transformations separately.But I'm not sure.Wait, let's try with n=4.Start with (a, b, c, d). After one transformation: (ab, bc, cd, da).After two transformations: (ab*bc, bc*cd, cd*da, da*ab) = (a b¬≤ c, b c¬≤ d, c d¬≤ a, d a¬≤ b).After three transformations: Each element is the product of two elements from the previous step.This seems complicated. Maybe instead, consider that after each transformation, the exponents of -1 are being combined in a certain way.Wait, going back to the exponent representation: x'_i = x_i + x_{i+1} mod 2.So, each transformation is equivalent to adding each bit to its neighbor.This is similar to a linear feedback shift register.Wait, maybe consider that after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, the bits have been \\"mixed\\" enough to cancel out.But I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: Since n is a power of 2, the transformation matrix M is similar to a companion matrix, and its minimal polynomial divides x^{2^k} - x.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe think about the transformation as a kind of binary convolution, and after enough convolutions, the signal decays to zero.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe consider that each transformation is equivalent to multiplying by a certain polynomial, and after enough multiplications, the result is zero.But I'm not sure.Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.Wait, let's think about the problem in terms of the number of -1s. Each transformation could potentially reduce the number of -1s.But how?Suppose we have a run of k consecutive -1s. After one transformation, the product of two adjacent -1s is 1, so the run of k -1s would become a run of (k-1) 1s and one -1.Wait, no, actually, each element is the product of two adjacent elements. So, if we have a run of k consecutive -1s, the transformation would produce:- The first element: (-1)*(-1) = 1- The second element: (-1)*(-1) = 1- ...- The (k-1)th element: (-1)*(-1) = 1- The kth element: (-1)*something else.Wait, actually, if the run is at the end, it wraps around because it's a cyclic tuple.Wait, maybe it's better to think of specific examples.Let's take n=4 and a tuple with two -1s: (1, -1, -1, 1).After one transformation: (1*(-1), (-1)*(-1), (-1)*1, 1*1) = (-1, 1, -1, 1).After two transformations: (-1*1, 1*(-1), (-1)*1, 1*(-1)) = (-1, -1, -1, -1).After three transformations: (-1*(-1), (-1)*(-1), (-1)*(-1), (-1)*(-1)) = (1, 1, 1, 1).So, in three transformations, we reached all 1s.Another example: n=4, tuple (1, -1, 1, -1).After one transformation: (1*(-1), (-1)*1, 1*(-1), (-1)*1) = (-1, -1, -1, -1).After two transformations: (1, 1, 1, 1).So, in two transformations, we reached all 1s.Another example: n=4, tuple (-1, -1, -1, -1).After one transformation: (1, 1, 1, 1).So, in one transformation, we reached all 1s.Hmm, interesting. It seems that depending on the initial configuration, it takes a different number of transformations, but eventually, it reaches all 1s.Wait, but in the first example, it took three transformations, which is more than log‚ÇÇ(4)=2.So, maybe the number of transformations needed is not necessarily log‚ÇÇ(n), but something else.Wait, but in the first example, the number of -1s was two, and it took three transformations to reach all 1s.In the second example, the number of -1s was two, and it took two transformations.Wait, maybe the number of transformations needed is related to the number of -1s.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: Since each transformation is equivalent to adding each bit to its neighbor, in GF(2), this is similar to a linear transformation that can be represented as a matrix. If we can show that this matrix is invertible or has certain properties, we can conclude that after enough transformations, we reach the zero vector.But I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: Since n is a power of 2, the transformation can be applied recursively on smaller subsets of the tuple.For example, for n=4, split the tuple into two pairs, apply the transformation on each pair, and then combine.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe think about the transformation as a kind of binary tree, where each level corresponds to a transformation, and the leaves correspond to the original elements.But I'm not sure.Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern or a theorem that applies here.Wait, I recall that in problems involving transformations on tuples with products, especially when n is a power of 2, the transformations often lead to all elements becoming 1 after a certain number of steps due to the properties of the transformation and the structure of the tuple.But I need to make this more precise.Wait, another idea: Since each transformation squares the product, and after one transformation, the product is 1, maybe after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, all elements become 1.But I need to see why.Wait, let's think about the exponents again. If we represent each -1 as 1 and 1 as 0, then the transformation is x'_i = x_i + x_{i+1} mod 2.So, after k transformations, the state is M^k x, where M is the transformation matrix.We need to show that for some k, M^k x = 0 for all x.But actually, we need to show that for any initial x, M^k x = 0.This would mean that M is nilpotent, i.e., M^k = 0 for some k.But earlier, we saw that for n=4, M has eigenvalues 2, 1+i, 0, 1-i, so it's not nilpotent.Wait, but in our problem, we're working over GF(2), so maybe the behavior is different.Wait, no, the eigenvalues are still in the complex field, regardless of the field we're working over.Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, maybe instead of looking at eigenvalues, think about the transformation as a kind of binary operation that eventually leads to all zeros.Wait, another idea: Since n is a power of 2, the transformation can be applied log‚ÇÇ(n) times, and each application reduces the number of -1s in some way.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe consider that each transformation is equivalent to a kind of \\"diffusion\\" where the -1s spread out and cancel each other.But I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: Since the transformation is linear, and n is a power of 2, the transformation matrix M has a certain structure that allows us to conclude that after n transformations, we reach the zero vector.But I'm not sure.Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think differently.Wait, let's consider that each transformation is equivalent to multiplying the tuple by itself in a certain way.Wait, no, that's not helpful.Wait, another idea: Since each transformation is a kind of convolution, and n is a power of 2, we can use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the behavior.But I'm not sure.Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.Wait, another idea: Since n is a power of 2, and the transformation is cyclic, maybe after n transformations, each element has been multiplied by itself enough times to become 1.But I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: Since each transformation squares the product, and after one transformation, the product is 1, maybe after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, all elements become 1.But I need to see why.Wait, let's think about the exponents again. If we represent each -1 as 1 and 1 as 0, then the transformation is x'_i = x_i + x_{i+1} mod 2.So, after k transformations, the state is M^k x.We need to show that for some k, M^k x = 0 for all x.But since M is not nilpotent, this might not be possible.Wait, but in our examples earlier, we saw that after a certain number of transformations, we reached all 1s, which corresponds to the zero vector in the exponent representation.So, maybe M^k is the identity matrix for some k, but that would mean that after k transformations, we return to the original state, not necessarily the zero vector.Wait, but in our examples, we didn't return to the original state, but reached the zero vector.Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, maybe the key is that after one transformation, the product is 1, and then each subsequent transformation maintains the product as 1, but also reduces the number of -1s in some way.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: Since the product is 1 after the first transformation, and n is a power of 2, maybe the number of -1s must be even, and each transformation reduces the number of -1s by half or something.But I'm not sure.Wait, let's think about the number of -1s. Suppose we have m -1s in the tuple. After one transformation, each -1 can potentially create new -1s or cancel out.But it's not straightforward.Wait, maybe consider that each -1 in the original tuple affects the next tuple in a certain way, and after enough transformations, their effects cancel out.But I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: Since n is a power of 2, the transformation can be applied recursively, and each application reduces the problem size by half, leading to all 1s after log‚ÇÇ(n) steps.But I'm not sure.Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should give up and look for another approach.Wait, another idea: Since each transformation is equivalent to multiplying the tuple by itself in a certain way, and n is a power of 2, maybe after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, the tuple becomes all 1s.But I need to make this precise.Wait, let's think about the transformation as a kind of exponentiation. Each transformation squares the product, and after log‚ÇÇ(n) transformations, the product is raised to the power of 2^{log‚ÇÇ(n)} = n.But since the product is 1 after the first transformation, raising it to any power still gives 1.Wait, but we need to show that all elements become 1, not just the product.Wait, maybe think about the individual elements. Each element is the product of two elements from the previous step, so after k transformations, each element is the product of 2^k elements from the original tuple.Since n is a power of 2, say n=2^m, after m transformations, each element is the product of all elements in the original tuple.But since the product of all elements is 1 after the first transformation, and remains 1 thereafter, each element after m transformations would be 1.Wait, that sounds promising.Let me formalize this.Let n=2^m.After one transformation, each element is the product of two adjacent elements, so each element is a product of 2 elements.After two transformations, each element is the product of four elements.After k transformations, each element is the product of 2^k elements.After m transformations, each element is the product of 2^m = n elements.But since the product of all n elements is 1 (after the first transformation), each element after m transformations is 1.Therefore, after m transformations, all elements become 1.Yes, that makes sense.So, for part (b), since n is a power of 2, say n=2^m, after m transformations, each element is the product of all n elements, which is 1. Therefore, all elements become 1.Therefore, part (b) is proved."},{"question":"We define ( F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 ) for ( n geq 2 ) and take a prime factor ( p ) of ( F_n ). Show that:a) ( 2 ) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p );b) ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}} ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about Fermat numbers. Fermat numbers are defined as ( F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 ) for ( n geq 0 ). I remember that Fermat conjectured that all these numbers are prime, but that turned out not to be true. Anyway, the problem is about a prime factor ( p ) of ( F_n ) where ( n geq 2 ). I need to show two things: a) That 2 is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ).b) That ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}} ).Okay, let's start with part (a). I need to show that 2 is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ). I recall that a number ( a ) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ) if there exists some integer ( x ) such that ( x^2 equiv a pmod{p} ). So, I need to show that there exists an ( x ) such that ( x^2 equiv 2 pmod{p} ).I also remember something about the Legendre symbol, which can help determine if a number is a quadratic residue modulo a prime. The Legendre symbol ( left( frac{a}{p} right) ) is 1 if ( a ) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ), -1 if it's a non-residue, and 0 if ( p ) divides ( a ). So, maybe I can use that.But first, since ( p ) is a prime factor of ( F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 ), that means ( F_n equiv 0 pmod{p} ), so ( 2^{2^n} equiv -1 pmod{p} ). If I square both sides, I get ( 2^{2^{n+1}} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). This tells me that the order of 2 modulo ( p ) divides ( 2^{n+1} ). The order of an element is the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that ( 2^k equiv 1 pmod{p} ). So, the order of 2 modulo ( p ) is ( 2^{n+1} ), because ( 2^{2^n} equiv -1 pmod{p} ) and not 1, so the order can't be smaller than ( 2^{n+1} ).Now, since the order of 2 is ( 2^{n+1} ), by Fermat's Little Theorem, this order must divide ( p - 1 ). So, ( 2^{n+1} ) divides ( p - 1 ), which means ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+1}} ).Hmm, okay, so ( p ) is congruent to 1 modulo ( 2^{n+1} ). Since ( n geq 2 ), ( 2^{n+1} ) is at least 8, so ( p equiv 1 pmod{8} ). I also remember that for primes ( p equiv 1 pmod{8} ), 2 is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ). There's a theorem about that, maybe related to the quadratic reciprocity law. Let me recall: the Legendre symbol ( left( frac{2}{p} right) ) is equal to ( (-1)^{(p^2 - 1)/8} ). So, if ( p equiv 1 pmod{8} ), then ( (p^2 - 1)/8 ) is an integer, and since ( p = 8k + 1 ), ( p^2 = 64k^2 + 16k + 1 ), so ( (p^2 - 1)/8 = 8k^2 + 2k ). This is an even integer because 8k¬≤ is even and 2k is even, so their sum is even. Therefore, ( (-1)^{(p^2 - 1)/8} = 1 ), which means ( left( frac{2}{p} right) = 1 ). Therefore, 2 is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ). Okay, that takes care of part (a). Now, moving on to part (b): showing that ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}} ).I need to show that ( p ) is congruent to 1 modulo a higher power of 2, specifically ( 2^{n+2} ). From part (a), I already know that ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+1}} ). So, I need to strengthen this congruence.Since 2 is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ), there exists some integer ( a ) such that ( a^2 equiv 2 pmod{p} ). Let's consider the order of ( a ) modulo ( p ). Since ( a^2 equiv 2 pmod{p} ), the order of ( a ) must be a multiple of the order of 2. We know that the order of 2 modulo ( p ) is ( 2^{n+1} ). Therefore, the order of ( a ) must be ( 2^{n+2} ), because if ( a^2 equiv 2 pmod{p} ), then ( a^{2^{n+2}} equiv 2^{2^{n+1}} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). So, the order of ( a ) is ( 2^{n+2} ).By Fermat's Little Theorem, the order of ( a ) must divide ( p - 1 ). Therefore, ( 2^{n+2} ) divides ( p - 1 ), which implies that ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}} ).Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. I said that since ( a^2 equiv 2 pmod{p} ), the order of ( a ) is ( 2^{n+2} ). Is that necessarily true?Well, the order of ( a ) must be such that ( a^{2^{n+2}} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Since ( a^2 equiv 2 pmod{p} ), then ( a^{2^{k}} equiv 2^{2^{k-1}} pmod{p} ). So, for ( k = n+1 ), ( a^{2^{n+1}} equiv 2^{2^{n}} equiv -1 pmod{p} ). Therefore, ( a^{2^{n+2}} equiv (-1)^2 equiv 1 pmod{p} ). So, the order of ( a ) is indeed ( 2^{n+2} ), because ( a^{2^{n+1}} equiv -1 pmod{p} ) which is not 1, so the order can't be smaller than ( 2^{n+2} ).Therefore, the order of ( a ) is ( 2^{n+2} ), which divides ( p - 1 ), so ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}} ). That seems solid.Let me recap:1. ( p ) divides ( F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 ), so ( 2^{2^n} equiv -1 pmod{p} ).2. Squaring both sides, ( 2^{2^{n+1}} equiv 1 pmod{p} ), so the order of 2 modulo ( p ) is ( 2^{n+1} ).3. Since the order divides ( p - 1 ), ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+1}} ).4. Because ( p equiv 1 pmod{8} ), 2 is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ).5. There exists an integer ( a ) such that ( a^2 equiv 2 pmod{p} ).6. The order of ( a ) is ( 2^{n+2} ), which divides ( p - 1 ), so ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}} ).I think that covers both parts. I should check if there are any gaps or mistakes in my reasoning.In part (a), I used the fact that ( p equiv 1 pmod{8} ) to conclude that 2 is a quadratic residue. Is that always true? Let me recall the quadratic reciprocity for 2. The Legendre symbol ( left( frac{2}{p} right) = 1 ) if ( p equiv 1 ) or ( 7 pmod{8} ), and -1 if ( p equiv 3 ) or ( 5 pmod{8} ). Since ( p equiv 1 pmod{8} ), it's indeed a quadratic residue. So, that part is correct.In part (b), I assumed that the order of ( a ) is ( 2^{n+2} ). Is there a possibility that the order could be a multiple of ( 2^{n+2} ) but not exactly ( 2^{n+2} )? Well, since ( a^{2^{n+2}} equiv 1 pmod{p} ), and ( a^{2^{n+1}} equiv -1 pmod{p} ), which is not 1, the order must be exactly ( 2^{n+2} ). So, that seems correct.Therefore, I think my reasoning is solid for both parts. I don't see any mistakes in the logic.**Final Answer**a) boxed{2} is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ).b) boxed{p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}}}"},{"question":"Consider a sequence of positive terms {a_n} with partial sum S_n.

Determine the sum of the first 2016 terms of the sequence {C_n}.A: - frac{2015}{2016}B: - frac{2016}{2015}C: - frac{2017}{2016}D: - frac{2016}{2017}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a sequence of positive terms {a_n} with partial sums S_n. The given condition is that 2S_n = a_n¬≤ + a_n for all natural numbers n. Then there's another sequence C_n defined as (-1)^n times (2a_n + 1)/(2S_n). I need to find the sum of the first 2016 terms of {C_n}.Alright, let me start by understanding what's given. We have a relationship between the partial sum S_n and the nth term a_n. The equation is 2S_n = a_n¬≤ + a_n. Since S_n is the partial sum, that means S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n. So, each partial sum is related to the square of the nth term plus the nth term itself.Hmm, maybe I can express a_n in terms of S_n. Let's rearrange the equation:2S_n = a_n¬≤ + a_nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of a_n. So, I can write it as:a_n¬≤ + a_n - 2S_n = 0Using the quadratic formula, a_n = [-1 ¬± sqrt(1 + 8S_n)] / 2Since the sequence consists of positive terms, I'll take the positive root:a_n = [-1 + sqrt(1 + 8S_n)] / 2Okay, so that's an expression for a_n in terms of S_n. But I need to find S_n in terms of n to make progress. Maybe I can find a recursive relationship or find a pattern.Let me think about S_n and S_{n-1}. Since S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n, I can substitute the expression for a_n into this.So, S_n = S_{n-1} + [-1 + sqrt(1 + 8S_n)] / 2Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way. Let's see if I can find a relationship between S_n and S_{n-1}.Given that 2S_n = a_n¬≤ + a_n, and S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n, so substituting S_n into the equation:2(S_{n-1} + a_n) = a_n¬≤ + a_nExpanding that:2S_{n-1} + 2a_n = a_n¬≤ + a_nSubtracting a_n from both sides:2S_{n-1} + a_n = a_n¬≤So, 2S_{n-1} = a_n¬≤ - a_nBut from the original equation, 2S_{n-1} = a_{n-1}¬≤ + a_{n-1}Therefore, a_n¬≤ - a_n = a_{n-1}¬≤ + a_{n-1}So, a_n¬≤ - a_n - a_{n-1}¬≤ - a_{n-1} = 0Hmm, that's a difference equation. Maybe I can factor this.Let me write it as:(a_n¬≤ - a_{n-1}¬≤) - (a_n + a_{n-1}) = 0Factor the difference of squares:(a_n - a_{n-1})(a_n + a_{n-1}) - (a_n + a_{n-1}) = 0Factor out (a_n + a_{n-1}):(a_n + a_{n-1})(a_n - a_{n-1} - 1) = 0Since all terms are positive, a_n + a_{n-1} can't be zero. So, we have:a_n - a_{n-1} - 1 = 0Which simplifies to:a_n = a_{n-1} + 1Oh! So the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 1. That's a big simplification.So, if a_n is arithmetic with common difference 1, then a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)*1 = a_1 + n - 1Now, let's find a_1. Using the original equation for n=1:2S_1 = a_1¬≤ + a_1But S_1 = a_1, so:2a_1 = a_1¬≤ + a_1Subtract 2a_1:0 = a_1¬≤ - a_1So, a_1(a_1 - 1) = 0Since the sequence is positive, a_1 = 1Therefore, a_n = 1 + (n - 1) = nSo, a_n = n for all n.Wait, that's nice. So, each term is just n. Then, the partial sum S_n is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2Let me verify that with the original equation:2S_n = a_n¬≤ + a_n2*(n(n + 1)/2) = n¬≤ + nSimplify left side: n(n + 1) = n¬≤ + nWhich is equal to the right side. Perfect, that checks out.So, now I know that a_n = n and S_n = n(n + 1)/2Now, let's look at C_n:C_n = (-1)^n * (2a_n + 1)/(2S_n)Substituting a_n and S_n:C_n = (-1)^n * (2n + 1)/(2*(n(n + 1)/2)) = (-1)^n * (2n + 1)/(n(n + 1))Simplify denominator: 2*(n(n + 1)/2) = n(n + 1)So, C_n = (-1)^n * (2n + 1)/(n(n + 1))Hmm, so C_n = (-1)^n * (2n + 1)/(n(n + 1))I need to find the sum of the first 2016 terms of {C_n}, which is sum_{n=1}^{2016} C_nSo, let's write out the sum:Sum = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + ... + C_{2016}Each term is (-1)^n * (2n + 1)/(n(n + 1))Let me see if I can simplify this expression. Maybe partial fractions?Let me consider (2n + 1)/(n(n + 1)). Let's decompose this into partial fractions.Let me write (2n + 1)/(n(n + 1)) = A/n + B/(n + 1)Multiply both sides by n(n + 1):2n + 1 = A(n + 1) + BnExpand right side:2n + 1 = An + A + Bn = (A + B)n + ANow, equate coefficients:For n: 2 = A + BFor constants: 1 = ASo, A = 1, then B = 2 - 1 = 1Therefore, (2n + 1)/(n(n + 1)) = 1/n + 1/(n + 1)So, C_n = (-1)^n * [1/n + 1/(n + 1)]Therefore, the sum becomes:Sum = sum_{n=1}^{2016} (-1)^n [1/n + 1/(n + 1)]Let me split this into two separate sums:Sum = sum_{n=1}^{2016} (-1)^n / n + sum_{n=1}^{2016} (-1)^n / (n + 1)Let me denote the first sum as Sum1 and the second as Sum2.Sum1 = sum_{n=1}^{2016} (-1)^n / nSum2 = sum_{n=1}^{2016} (-1)^n / (n + 1)Let me adjust the index for Sum2 to make it easier. Let k = n + 1. When n=1, k=2; when n=2016, k=2017.So, Sum2 = sum_{k=2}^{2017} (-1)^{k - 1} / kBecause when n = k - 1, (-1)^n = (-1)^{k - 1}So, Sum2 = sum_{k=2}^{2017} (-1)^{k - 1} / k = - sum_{k=2}^{2017} (-1)^k / kTherefore, Sum2 = - [sum_{k=2}^{2017} (-1)^k / k]Now, let's write the total sum:Sum = Sum1 + Sum2 = sum_{n=1}^{2016} (-1)^n / n - sum_{k=2}^{2017} (-1)^k / kNotice that the second sum is almost the same as the first sum, except it starts at k=2 and goes to k=2017, while the first sum starts at n=1 and goes to n=2016.Let me write both sums with the same index for clarity:Sum = sum_{n=1}^{2016} (-1)^n / n - sum_{n=2}^{2017} (-1)^n / nNow, let's subtract these two sums:Sum = [sum_{n=1}^{2016} (-1)^n / n] - [sum_{n=2}^{2017} (-1)^n / n]This can be rewritten as:Sum = (-1)^1 / 1 + [sum_{n=2}^{2016} (-1)^n / n] - [sum_{n=2}^{2016} (-1)^n / n] - (-1)^{2017} / 2017Simplify:The sums from n=2 to n=2016 cancel out, leaving:Sum = (-1)/1 - (-1)^{2017}/2017Simplify further:Sum = -1 - [(-1)^{2017}/2017]Since 2017 is odd, (-1)^{2017} = -1So,Sum = -1 - (-1)/2017 = -1 + 1/2017Combine the terms:Sum = (-2017/2017) + (1/2017) = (-2016)/2017So, the sum of the first 2016 terms of {C_n} is -2016/2017.Looking back at the options, that's option D: -2016/2017.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"How many faces does an octahedron have?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many faces an octahedron has. Hmm, I remember that an octahedron is a type of polyhedron, but I'm not exactly sure about the details. Let me think. I know that \\"octa-\\" means eight in Greek, so maybe that has something to do with it. Wait, is it eight faces? That would make sense because \\"octa-\\" refers to eight. But I should double-check to be sure. I recall that there are different types of octahedrons, like the regular octahedron, which is one of the Platonic solids. Platonic solids have all their faces as regular polygons, and they are highly symmetrical.So, if it's a regular octahedron, each face should be a triangle. Let me visualize it. A regular octahedron has two pyramids with a triangular base glued together at their bases. Each pyramid has three triangular faces, so combined, that would make six faces. But wait, that doesn't add up because if I have two pyramids, each with three faces, that's six, but when you glue them together, the base faces are internal, right? So maybe the total number of faces is still eight? Hmm, I'm getting confused.Let me try another approach. I remember Euler's formula for polyhedrons, which states that the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces equals two. The formula is V - E + F = 2. If I can find out the number of vertices and edges, I can solve for the number of faces.For a regular octahedron, I think it has six vertices. Let me confirm that. Yes, a regular octahedron has six vertices. Now, how about the edges? Each face is a triangle, and each triangle has three edges. But each edge is shared by two faces. So, if there are F faces, each with three edges, the total number of edges would be (3F)/2.But I don't know F yet, so maybe I can find E another way. I think a regular octahedron has twelve edges. Let me see. If I have two pyramids, each pyramid has three edges on the base and three edges connecting the base to the apex. So, each pyramid has six edges, but when you glue them together, the base edges are shared, so the total number of edges would be six from one pyramid plus three from the other, making nine? Wait, that doesn't seem right.Wait, no, when you glue two pyramids together at their bases, the base edges are internal and not part of the exterior. So, each pyramid has three base edges and three side edges. When glued together, the three base edges are internal, and each pyramid contributes three side edges. So, the total number of edges would be six. But that can't be right because I thought it was twelve.I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look up the properties of a regular octahedron. Wait, I can't look things up, but I remember that a regular octahedron is dual to a cube. A cube has six faces, eight vertices, and twelve edges. Since they are duals, the number of vertices of one corresponds to the number of faces of the other. So, if a cube has six faces, then the octahedron should have six vertices. That matches what I thought earlier.Similarly, the number of edges should be the same for both, which is twelve. So, if a cube has twelve edges, then the octahedron also has twelve edges. Now, using Euler's formula, V - E + F = 2. We have V = 6, E = 12. Plugging in, 6 - 12 + F = 2. So, -6 + F = 2, which means F = 8.Okay, so that confirms it. The regular octahedron has eight faces. Each face is a triangle, and there are eight of them. So, the answer should be eight faces."},{"question":"Two circles with centers A and B have radii 5 units and 3 units respectively, and are externally tangent at point C. A common external tangent touches the circles at points D and E. Find the length of segment AB.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two circles that are externally tangent. Let me try to visualize it first. There's circle A with radius 5 units and circle B with radius 3 units. They touch each other at point C, which means they're just barely touching without overlapping. There's also a common external tangent that touches each circle at points D and E. I need to find the length of segment AB, which is the distance between the centers of the two circles.Hmm, I remember that when two circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. So, in this case, circle A has a radius of 5 and circle B has a radius of 3, so the distance AB should be 5 + 3 = 8 units. That seems straightforward, but wait, the problem mentions a common external tangent. Maybe I need to consider that as well?Let me think. A common external tangent is a line that touches both circles without crossing between them. The points where the tangent touches the circles are D on circle A and E on circle B. Since DE is a tangent, the radii AD and BE should be perpendicular to DE at points D and E respectively. So, triangles ADE and BEC are right triangles.Wait, no, actually, triangle ADE isn't necessarily a right triangle unless DE is the tangent. But since DE is a tangent, then yes, angles at D and E are right angles. So, triangle ADE is a right triangle with legs AD and DE, and hypotenuse AE. Similarly, triangle BEC is a right triangle with legs BE and EC, and hypotenuse BC.But I'm not sure if I need to use these right triangles to find AB. Since AB is just the distance between the centers, and the circles are externally tangent, it should be the sum of the radii. But maybe I should verify this using the properties of the tangent.Let me draw a diagram in my mind. Circle A is bigger, radius 5, circle B is smaller, radius 3. They touch at point C. The external tangent touches circle A at D and circle B at E. So, if I draw line DE, it's tangent to both circles. Then, lines AD and BE are perpendicular to DE.If I consider the quadrilateral ADEB, it has two right angles at D and E. So, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem somewhere here. But I'm not sure how to relate this to AB directly.Alternatively, I remember that the length of the common external tangent between two circles can be found using the formula:Length of external tangent = sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2)where d is the distance between the centers, and r1 and r2 are the radii.But wait, in this case, I don't know the length of the external tangent DE, but I might not need it because I'm supposed to find AB. Hmm, maybe I can rearrange the formula to solve for d.So, if I let DE be the length of the external tangent, then:DE = sqrt(AB^2 - (5 - 3)^2)DE = sqrt(AB^2 - 4)But I don't know DE, so maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, since the circles are externally tangent, the distance AB is just 5 + 3 = 8. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering the external tangent.Wait, but the problem mentions the external tangent, so maybe it's trying to test my understanding of both the external tangent and the distance between centers. Let me think again.If I consider the external tangent DE, and the radii AD and BE are perpendicular to DE, then the lines AD and BE are both perpendicular to the same line, which means AD is parallel to BE. So, the quadrilateral ADEB has AD parallel to BE and both are perpendicular to DE, making it a trapezoid with right angles at D and E.In this trapezoid, the distance between the two parallel sides AD and BE is DE, and the lengths of AD and BE are 5 and 3 respectively. The distance between the centers AB can be found by considering the line connecting A and B, which would form the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the difference in radii (5 - 3 = 2) and the other leg is the length of the external tangent DE.Wait, that sounds like the formula I mentioned earlier. So, AB^2 = DE^2 + (5 - 3)^2. But I don't know DE, so I can't use this directly. Hmm.But since the circles are externally tangent, the distance AB is just the sum of the radii, which is 8. Maybe the mention of the external tangent is just additional information, but it's not necessary to solve for AB because AB is determined by the fact that the circles are externally tangent.Alternatively, if the circles weren't tangent, then AB would be greater than the sum of the radii, and the external tangent length would be as per the formula. But since they are externally tangent, AB is exactly 5 + 3 = 8.I think I'm confusing myself by trying to involve the external tangent when it's not necessary. The key here is that the circles are externally tangent, so the distance between centers is the sum of the radii. The external tangent is just extra information, perhaps to test if I know that the distance between centers when circles are externally tangent is simply the sum of the radii.So, to conclude, AB = 5 + 3 = 8 units."},{"question":"Given a function f(x) with domain I, if there exists an open interval (a,b) subseteq I and a positive constant c, such that for any x in (a,b), -c < f(x) < c holds, and for any x notin (a,b), |f(x)|=c always holds, then f(x) is called a \\"Z-type\\" function on interval I.

Let me try to understand what a \\"Z-type\\" function is first.The definition says: A function ( f(x) ) with domain ( I ) is called a \\"Z-type\\" function if there exists an open interval ( (a, b) subseteq I ) and a positive constant ( c ) such that:1. For any ( x in (a, b) ), ( -c < f(x) < c ).2. For any ( x notin (a, b) ), ( |f(x)| = c ).So, essentially, the function is bounded between ( -c ) and ( c ) on some open interval ( (a, b) ), and outside of this interval, the function's absolute value is exactly ( c ). That makes sense. It's like the function is \\"zapped\\" to the constant ( c ) outside of this interval, hence the name \\"Z-type.\\"Now, let's look at the four functions given and see which ones fit this definition.**Function 1:**[ f(x) = begin{cases} 2, & x leq 1 4 - 2x, & 1 < x < 3 -2, & x geq 3 end{cases} ]Okay, let's analyze this piecewise function.- For ( x leq 1 ), ( f(x) = 2 ).- For ( 1 < x < 3 ), ( f(x) = 4 - 2x ).- For ( x geq 3 ), ( f(x) = -2 ).First, let's check if there's an open interval where ( f(x) ) is bounded between ( -c ) and ( c ), and outside of that interval, ( |f(x)| = c ).Looking at the intervals:- When ( x leq 1 ), ( f(x) = 2 ). So, ( |f(x)| = 2 ).- When ( x geq 3 ), ( f(x) = -2 ). So, ( |f(x)| = 2 ).- In between, for ( 1 < x < 3 ), ( f(x) = 4 - 2x ). Let's see what the range of this is.When ( x = 1 ), ( f(x) = 4 - 2(1) = 2 ).When ( x = 3 ), ( f(x) = 4 - 2(3) = -2 ).So, as ( x ) increases from 1 to 3, ( f(x) ) decreases from 2 to -2.Therefore, in the interval ( (1, 3) ), ( f(x) ) varies between -2 and 2. So, for ( x in (1, 3) ), ( -2 < f(x) < 2 ). That fits the first condition with ( c = 2 ).Outside of ( (1, 3) ), for ( x leq 1 ) and ( x geq 3 ), ( |f(x)| = 2 ). So, that fits the second condition.Therefore, function 1 is a \\"Z-type\\" function with ( (a, b) = (1, 3) ) and ( c = 2 ).**Function 2:**[ f(x) = begin{cases} sqrt{x}, & x geq 0 0, & x < 0 end{cases} ]Let's analyze this function.- For ( x geq 0 ), ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ). As ( x ) increases, ( sqrt{x} ) increases without bound. So, ( f(x) ) can be made arbitrarily large.- For ( x < 0 ), ( f(x) = 0 ).Now, according to the definition of a \\"Z-type\\" function, we need an open interval ( (a, b) ) where ( |f(x)| < c ) and outside of this interval, ( |f(x)| = c ).But here, for ( x geq 0 ), ( f(x) ) can be made larger than any constant ( c ) by choosing a sufficiently large ( x ). So, there's no finite ( c ) such that ( |f(x)| < c ) on some interval ( (a, b) ) and ( |f(x)| = c ) outside of it. Because as ( x ) increases, ( f(x) ) just keeps growing.Moreover, for ( x < 0 ), ( f(x) = 0 ), which is not equal to ( c ) unless ( c = 0 ), but ( c ) has to be positive. So, this function doesn't satisfy the second condition either.Therefore, function 2 is not a \\"Z-type\\" function.**Function 3:**[ f(x) = |sin x| ]Alright, this is the absolute value of the sine function. Let's recall that ( |sin x| ) oscillates between 0 and 1 for all real numbers ( x ).So, ( 0 leq |sin x| leq 1 ).Now, according to the definition, we need an open interval ( (a, b) ) where ( |f(x)| < c ) and outside of this interval, ( |f(x)| = c ).But ( |sin x| ) is always less than or equal to 1, but it never actually reaches 1 except at discrete points ( x = frac{pi}{2} + kpi ) for integers ( k ). So, except at those points, ( |sin x| < 1 ).But the problem is, outside of any interval ( (a, b) ), ( |sin x| ) doesn't equal 1 everywhere. It only equals 1 at specific points. So, for example, if we pick an interval ( (a, b) ) that doesn't include any of those points where ( |sin x| = 1 ), then outside of ( (a, b) ), ( |sin x| ) is still less than 1, not equal to 1. Conversely, if we include some of those points in ( (a, b) ), then outside of ( (a, b) ), ( |sin x| ) is still less than 1.Moreover, ( |sin x| ) is periodic, so it keeps oscillating between 0 and 1. Therefore, it's impossible to have an open interval ( (a, b) ) such that outside of it, ( |f(x)| = c ) for some constant ( c ). Because outside of ( (a, b) ), ( |f(x)| ) will still oscillate between 0 and 1, not staying constant.Therefore, function 3 is not a \\"Z-type\\" function.**Function 4:**[ f(x) = x + cos x ]Alright, this function is ( x + cos x ). Let's analyze its behavior.First, ( cos x ) oscillates between -1 and 1, so ( f(x) = x + cos x ) will behave similarly to ( x ), but with a small oscillation around it.As ( x ) approaches positive infinity, ( f(x) ) approaches positive infinity, and as ( x ) approaches negative infinity, ( f(x) ) approaches negative infinity.So, ( f(x) ) is unbounded both above and below.Now, according to the definition of a \\"Z-type\\" function, we need an open interval ( (a, b) ) where ( |f(x)| < c ) and outside of this interval, ( |f(x)| = c ).But since ( f(x) ) is unbounded, for any interval ( (a, b) ), as ( x ) moves away from ( (a, b) ), ( |f(x)| ) will exceed any constant ( c ). Therefore, it's impossible to have such an interval ( (a, b) ) and a constant ( c ) that satisfy the conditions.Moreover, even if we try to find an interval where ( |f(x)| < c ), outside of that interval, ( |f(x)| ) will grow without bound, so it can't be equal to ( c ).Therefore, function 4 is not a \\"Z-type\\" function.**Conclusion:**After analyzing all four functions:1. Function 1 satisfies the conditions of a \\"Z-type\\" function.2. Function 2 does not satisfy the conditions.3. Function 3 does not satisfy the conditions.4. Function 4 does not satisfy the conditions.So, only function 1 is a \\"Z-type\\" function.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_1 = 2, a_8 = 4, and f(x) = x(x - a_1)(x - a_2) ldots (x - a_8), f'(x) is the derivative of the function f(x). Then, f'(0) = („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: 0B: 26C: 29D: 2^{12}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence and a function defined using its terms. Let me try to understand what it's asking step by step.First, the problem says that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, a‚ÇÅ = 2 and a‚Çà = 4. Then, there's a function f(x) defined as x times the product of (x - a‚ÇÅ)(x - a‚ÇÇ)...(x - a‚Çà). We need to find f'(0), which is the derivative of f(x) evaluated at x = 0. The options are given as A: 0, B: 26, C: 29, D: 2¬π¬≤.Alright, so let's break this down. I know that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio r. So, a‚ÇÅ = 2, a‚ÇÇ = 2r, a‚ÇÉ = 2r¬≤, and so on. Since a‚Çà is given as 4, I can find the common ratio r.The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a‚Çô = a‚ÇÅ * r^(n-1). So, for a‚Çà, that would be a‚Çà = a‚ÇÅ * r^(8-1) = 2 * r‚Å∑. We know a‚Çà is 4, so:4 = 2 * r‚Å∑  Divide both sides by 2:  2 = r‚Å∑  So, r = 2^(1/7). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but okay.Now, moving on to the function f(x). It's given by f(x) = x(x - a‚ÇÅ)(x - a‚ÇÇ)...(x - a‚Çà). So, f(x) is a polynomial of degree 9 because it's x multiplied by 8 linear terms. To find f'(x), we need to take the derivative of this function.But instead of expanding the entire polynomial, which would be really tedious, maybe there's a smarter way to find f'(0). I remember that the derivative of a product can be found using the product rule, but with so many terms, that might not be straightforward either.Wait, actually, I recall that for a function f(x) = x * g(x), where g(x) is the product (x - a‚ÇÅ)(x - a‚ÇÇ)...(x - a‚Çà), the derivative f'(x) can be expressed using the product rule as:f'(x) = g(x) + x * g'(x)So, f'(0) would be g(0) + 0 * g'(0) = g(0). Because the second term becomes zero when x is 0.Therefore, f'(0) is just g(0), where g(x) = (x - a‚ÇÅ)(x - a‚ÇÇ)...(x - a‚Çà). So, evaluating g(0) means plugging in x = 0 into each factor:g(0) = (-a‚ÇÅ)(-a‚ÇÇ)(-a‚ÇÉ)...(-a‚Çà)That's the product of (-a‚ÇÅ) through (-a‚Çà). So, that's (-1)^8 times (a‚ÇÅ * a‚ÇÇ * ... * a‚Çà). Since (-1)^8 is 1, because any even power of -1 is positive, so g(0) is just the product of all the a_i from i=1 to 8.So, f'(0) = a‚ÇÅ * a‚ÇÇ * ... * a‚Çà.Now, I need to compute the product of the first 8 terms of this geometric sequence. Let's recall that in a geometric sequence, the product of terms equidistant from the ends is the same. For example, a‚ÇÅ * a‚Çà = a‚ÇÇ * a‚Çá = ... and so on.Given that a‚ÇÅ = 2 and a‚Çà = 4, their product is 2 * 4 = 8. Since there are 8 terms, which is an even number, we can pair them up into 4 pairs, each multiplying to 8.Therefore, the product a‚ÇÅ * a‚ÇÇ * ... * a‚Çà = (a‚ÇÅ * a‚Çà) * (a‚ÇÇ * a‚Çá) * (a‚ÇÉ * a‚ÇÜ) * (a‚ÇÑ * a‚ÇÖ) = 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 8‚Å¥.Calculating 8‚Å¥: 8¬≤ is 64, so 8‚Å¥ is 64¬≤, which is 4096. Alternatively, 8 is 2¬≥, so 8‚Å¥ is (2¬≥)‚Å¥ = 2¬π¬≤, which is 4096 as well.Looking back at the options, D is 2¬π¬≤, which is 4096. So, that must be the answer.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, f'(0) is equal to the product of all a_i from 1 to 8. Since it's a geometric sequence, the product can be expressed as (a‚ÇÅ * a‚Çà)^(n/2), where n is the number of terms. Here, n=8, so it's (2*4)^(8/2) = 8‚Å¥ = 2¬π¬≤. Yep, that seems right.I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be D: 2¬π¬≤.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Mr. Baker thinks his own inconvenience and _________ of his fellow colleagues are the only thing that the government should deal with.A. whoever¬†¬†¬†¬† B. someone¬†¬†¬†¬† C. that¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† D. any","answer":"Okay, so I've got this sentence here: \\"Mr. Baker thinks his own inconvenience and _______ of his fellow colleagues are the only thing that the government should deal with.\\" And I need to figure out which word fits best in the blank. The options are A. whoever, B. someone, C. that, and D. any.Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. It seems like Mr. Baker is talking about two things: his own inconvenience and something else related to his colleagues. The blank is supposed to fill in that something else.Looking at the options, \\"whoever\\" and \\"someone\\" are pronouns that refer to people. \\"That\\" and \\"any\\" are more general pronouns or determiners. Since the sentence is talking about \\"inconvenience,\\" which is a noun, I think the blank should be a pronoun that refers back to \\"inconvenience.\\"So, if I use \\"that\\" in the blank, it would refer back to \\"inconvenience,\\" making the sentence: \\"Mr. Baker thinks his own inconvenience and that of his fellow colleagues are the only thing that the government should deal with.\\" That makes sense because \\"that\\" is replacing \\"inconvenience.\\"If I try \\"whoever,\\" it would imply that the inconvenience is caused by someone, which doesn't quite fit. \\"Someone\\" also doesn't make much sense in this context because it's referring to a person, not the inconvenience itself. \\"Any\\" could work, but it's more about quantity, like \\"any inconvenience,\\" which isn't exactly what's needed here.So, \\"that\\" seems to be the best fit because it clearly refers back to \\"inconvenience\\" and keeps the sentence grammatically correct."},{"question":"Let (a in mathbb{R}), then \\" (a=4) \\" is the condition for \\"Line (l_{1}): (ax+8y-8=0) is parallel to line (l_{2}): (2x+ay-a=0)\\" to beA: A sufficient but not necessary conditionB: A necessary but not sufficient conditionC: A necessary and sufficient conditionD: Neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about two lines being parallel, and I need to figure out whether the condition ( a = 4 ) is sufficient, necessary, both, or neither. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that for two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. So, I need to find the slopes of both lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) and set them equal to each other. Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:- Line ( l_1 ): ( ax + 8y - 8 = 0 )- Line ( l_2 ): ( 2x + ay - a = 0 )Okay, so to find the slope of each line, I should probably rewrite them in slope-intercept form, which is ( y = mx + b ), where ( m ) is the slope.Starting with ( l_1 ):( ax + 8y - 8 = 0 )Let me solve for ( y ):( 8y = -ax + 8 )Divide both sides by 8:( y = (-a/8)x + 1 )So, the slope ( m_1 ) of ( l_1 ) is ( -a/8 ).Now, doing the same for ( l_2 ):( 2x + ay - a = 0 )Solving for ( y ):( ay = -2x + a )Divide both sides by ( a ):( y = (-2/a)x + 1 )So, the slope ( m_2 ) of ( l_2 ) is ( -2/a ).Now, for the lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal:( m_1 = m_2 )Which gives:( -a/8 = -2/a )Hmm, let's solve this equation for ( a ). First, I can multiply both sides by ( 8a ) to eliminate the denominators:( (-a/8)(8a) = (-2/a)(8a) )Simplifying both sides:Left side: ( -a times a = -a^2 )Right side: ( -2 times 8 = -16 )So, we have:( -a^2 = -16 )Multiply both sides by -1:( a^2 = 16 )Taking square roots:( a = pm 4 )Wait, so ( a ) can be either 4 or -4. That means there are two possible values for ( a ) that make the lines parallel. But the condition given in the problem is ( a = 4 ). So, ( a = 4 ) is one of the solutions, but not the only one. That suggests that ( a = 4 ) is sufficient to make the lines parallel, but it's not necessary because ( a = -4 ) also works.Hold on, let me double-check this. If ( a = 4 ), then:- ( l_1 ): ( 4x + 8y - 8 = 0 ) simplifies to ( y = (-4/8)x + 1 = -0.5x + 1 )- ( l_2 ): ( 2x + 4y - 4 = 0 ) simplifies to ( y = (-2/4)x + 1 = -0.5x + 1 )So, both lines have the same slope and the same y-intercept, which means they are not just parallel but actually the same line. Wait, does that count as parallel? I think in some definitions, coinciding lines are considered parallel, but sometimes they are considered a special case. I need to clarify that.In the context of this problem, I think they are considering parallel lines as distinct lines with the same slope. If that's the case, then having the same y-intercept would mean they are not just parallel but coinciding. So, maybe ( a = 4 ) makes them coinciding, which might not be what the problem is asking for.But earlier, I found that ( a = -4 ) would give:- ( l_1 ): ( -4x + 8y - 8 = 0 ) simplifies to ( y = (4/8)x + 1 = 0.5x + 1 )- ( l_2 ): ( 2x - 4y - (-4) = 0 ) which is ( 2x - 4y + 4 = 0 ), simplifying to ( y = (2/4)x - 1 = 0.5x - 1 )So, here, both lines have the same slope ( 0.5 ) but different y-intercepts, meaning they are parallel and distinct. Wait, so if ( a = 4 ), the lines coincide, and if ( a = -4 ), they are parallel and distinct. So, does the problem consider coinciding lines as parallel? If yes, then both ( a = 4 ) and ( a = -4 ) make the lines parallel. If not, then only ( a = -4 ) does.I need to check the problem statement again. It says, \\"Line ( l_1 ) is parallel to line ( l_2 ).\\" It doesn't specify whether they have to be distinct. In mathematics, sometimes parallel lines are defined as lines that do not intersect, which would exclude coinciding lines. But in other contexts, especially in linear algebra, coinciding lines are considered parallel.Given that, I think in this problem, since it's about the condition for being parallel, and coinciding lines are a special case of parallel lines, ( a = 4 ) is a valid solution. However, ( a = -4 ) also works, so ( a = 4 ) is not the only solution.Therefore, ( a = 4 ) is a sufficient condition because if ( a = 4 ), the lines are parallel. But it's not a necessary condition because there's another value, ( a = -4 ), that also makes them parallel. So, ( a = 4 ) is sufficient but not necessary.Wait, but earlier when I plugged in ( a = 4 ), the lines coincided. If the problem requires the lines to be parallel and distinct, then ( a = 4 ) wouldn't be sufficient because they coincide. So, I need to clarify whether coinciding lines are considered parallel in this context.Looking back at the problem, it just says \\"parallel,\\" without specifying distinctness. So, I think in this case, coinciding lines are considered parallel. Therefore, both ( a = 4 ) and ( a = -4 ) make the lines parallel. Hence, ( a = 4 ) is sufficient but not necessary because another value also works.But wait, when ( a = 4 ), the lines coincide, which is a stronger condition than just being parallel. So, is ( a = 4 ) a sufficient condition for being parallel? Yes, because coinciding lines are a subset of parallel lines. But it's not necessary because another value, ( a = -4 ), also makes them parallel.Therefore, the correct answer should be A: A sufficient but not necessary condition.But hold on, earlier I thought about whether coinciding lines are considered parallel. If they are not, then ( a = 4 ) would not be sufficient because it makes them coincide, not just parallel. But in that case, only ( a = -4 ) would be sufficient. But since ( a = 4 ) is given as a condition, and it's one of the solutions, I think the problem is considering coinciding lines as parallel.So, in conclusion, ( a = 4 ) is sufficient because it ensures the lines are parallel (including coinciding), but it's not necessary because another value, ( a = -4 ), also works. Therefore, the answer is A.Wait, but the initial solution I wrote earlier concluded that it's neither sufficient nor necessary. That seems conflicting. Let me re-examine.In my initial solution, I thought that when ( a = 4 ), the lines coincide, which might not be considered as parallel in some contexts. But in reality, in most mathematical contexts, coinciding lines are considered parallel. So, ( a = 4 ) is a valid solution for the lines being parallel. However, since there's another solution ( a = -4 ), ( a = 4 ) is not the only solution, meaning it's not necessary.Therefore, ( a = 4 ) is sufficient (because it guarantees parallelism) but not necessary (because another value also works). So, the correct answer is A.But wait, in my initial solution, I concluded D, which was incorrect. I think I made a mistake there. So, the correct answer should be A.But let me double-check the equations again.For ( a = 4 ):- ( l_1 ): ( 4x + 8y - 8 = 0 ) simplifies to ( y = -0.5x + 1 )- ( l_2 ): ( 2x + 4y - 4 = 0 ) simplifies to ( y = -0.5x + 1 )They are the same line.For ( a = -4 ):- ( l_1 ): ( -4x + 8y - 8 = 0 ) simplifies to ( y = 0.5x + 1 )- ( l_2 ): ( 2x - 4y - (-4) = 0 ) simplifies to ( y = 0.5x - 1 )They have the same slope but different y-intercepts, so they are parallel and distinct.Therefore, ( a = 4 ) makes them coincide, which is a type of parallelism, and ( a = -4 ) makes them parallel and distinct. So, both are valid for parallelism.Hence, ( a = 4 ) is sufficient (as it ensures parallelism) but not necessary (since ( a = -4 ) also works). Therefore, the correct answer is A.But wait, in my initial solution, I thought that when ( a = 4 ), the lines coincide, which might not be considered as parallel in some contexts. But in reality, in most cases, coinciding lines are considered parallel. So, my initial conclusion of D was wrong. The correct answer should be A.However, I need to make sure that in the problem's context, coinciding lines are considered parallel. If they are, then A is correct. If not, then only ( a = -4 ) would be sufficient, making ( a = 4 ) neither sufficient nor necessary, which would be D. But since the problem doesn't specify distinctness, I think coinciding lines are included.Therefore, the answer is A: A sufficient but not necessary condition."},{"question":"Given that m, n, and l are three different lines, and alpha, beta are two different planes, consider the following propositions:  ‚ë† If m subset alpha, n subset alpha, m parallel beta, n parallel beta, then alpha parallel beta;  ‚ë° If m nsubseteq alpha, n subset alpha, m parallel n, then m parallel alpha;  ‚ë¢ If m subset alpha, n subset alpha, l perp m, l perp n, then l perp alpha;  ‚ë£ If m subset alpha, m perp beta, then alpha perp beta.

So, if two lines in plane Œ± are both parallel to another plane Œ≤, does that mean the entire plane Œ± is parallel to Œ≤? I remember something about two intersecting lines in a plane being enough to determine the plane's orientation. So, if m and n are two lines in Œ± that are both parallel to Œ≤, does that necessarily make Œ± parallel to Œ≤? Wait, but what if m and n are parallel to each other? Then they wouldn't determine the plane's orientation uniquely. So, maybe the proposition is only true if m and n intersect? The problem doesn't specify that m and n are intersecting, just that they are different lines. So, if m and n are parallel, then even if they're both parallel to Œ≤, Œ± might not be parallel to Œ≤. So, I think ‚ë† is incorrect because it doesn't specify that m and n intersect.Moving on to ‚ë°: If m is not a subset of Œ±, n is a subset of Œ±, and m is parallel to n, then m is parallel to Œ±.Alright, so m is a line not lying in plane Œ±, and it's parallel to another line n that is in Œ±. Does that mean m is parallel to the entire plane Œ±? I think there's a theorem about this. If a line is parallel to any line in a plane, then the line is parallel to the plane. So, yeah, that sounds right. So, ‚ë° should be correct.Next is ‚ë¢: If m is a subset of Œ±, n is a subset of Œ±, and l is perpendicular to both m and n, then l is perpendicular to Œ±.Hmm, so if a line l is perpendicular to two lines in plane Œ±, does that mean it's perpendicular to the entire plane? I recall that for a line to be perpendicular to a plane, it needs to be perpendicular to every line in that plane. But if l is only perpendicular to two lines, m and n, which are in Œ±, is that enough? I think it depends on whether m and n are intersecting. If m and n intersect, then yes, l would be perpendicular to the plane. But if m and n are parallel, then l might not be perpendicular to the entire plane. The problem doesn't specify that m and n intersect, so I can't assume that.

If ( D geq 0 ), then the equation has real roots.In this case, the equation is ( x^2 + 2x + a = 0 ).

So, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = k ).So, the discriminant ( D = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4(1)(k) = 4 - 4k ).For the equation to have real roots, ( D geq 0 ), so ( 4 - 4k geq 0 ).Solving for ( k ), I get ( 4 geq 4k ) which simplifies to ( 1 geq k ) or ( k leq 1 ).But in the problem, ( k ) is the same as ( a ), which is chosen randomly from the interval [0, 4]. So, ( a ) must be less than or equal to 1 for the equation to have real roots.Now, since ( a ) is chosen uniformly at random from [0, 4], the probability that ( a leq 1 ) is the length of the interval [0, 1] divided by the length of the entire interval [0, 4].The length of [0, 1] is 1, and the length of [0, 4] is 4. So, the probability is ( frac{1}{4} = 0.25 ).Wait, but let me double-check. Is there a possibility that I made a mistake in identifying the coefficients? Let me go back.The quadratic equation is ( x^2 + 2x + a = 0 ). So, in standard form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), here ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = a ) (the constant term). So, the discriminant is indeed ( D = 2^2 - 4(1)(a) = 4 - 4a ). Setting ( D geq 0 ), we get ( 4 - 4a geq 0 ), which simplifies to ( a leq 1 ).Since ( a ) is selected from [0, 4], the favorable interval is [0, 1], which has length 1. The total interval is [0, 4], which has length 4. So, the probability is ( frac{1}{4} ), which is 0.25. That corresponds to option A.I think that's correct. But just to make sure, let me visualize it. If I plot the quadratic equation ( x^2 + 2x + a ), the discriminant tells me whether it touches or crosses the x-axis. When ( a = 1 ), the discriminant is zero, so the equation has exactly one real root (a repeated root). For ( a < 1 ), the discriminant is positive, so two distinct real roots. For ( a > 1 ), the discriminant is negative, so no real roots.Since ( a ) is chosen from [0, 4], the values of ( a ) that result in real roots are from 0 to 1. The probability is the ratio of the favorable interval to the total interval, which is ( frac{1}{4} ).Therefore, the answer should be A: 0.25."},{"question":"Determine all pairs  (x, y)  of positive integers for which the equation [x + y + xy = 2006] holds.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: x + y + xy = 2006, and I need to find all pairs of positive integers (x, y) that satisfy it. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that sometimes equations like this can be factored or manipulated in a way that makes them easier to solve. Let me see if I can rewrite this equation in a different form. Looking at x + y + xy, I notice that if I add 1 to both sides, I get x + y + xy + 1 = 2007. Hmm, that seems interesting. Now, can I factor the left side somehow? Let me try.If I factor x out of the first two terms, I get x(1 + y) + y + 1. Wait, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe another approach. What if I consider it as (x + 1)(y + 1)? Let me check:(x + 1)(y + 1) = xy + x + y + 1. Oh! That's exactly what I have on the left side. So, (x + 1)(y + 1) = 2007. Great, so now the equation is factored into (x + 1)(y + 1) = 2007. Now, since x and y are positive integers, x + 1 and y + 1 must be integers greater than 1. So, I need to find all pairs of integers (a, b) such that a * b = 2007, where a and b are greater than 1. Then, I can subtract 1 from each to get x and y.So, first, I need to factorize 2007 to find all possible pairs (a, b). Let me do that.2007 divided by 3 is 669, because 3 * 669 = 2007. Then, 669 divided by 3 is 223, so 3 * 3 * 223 = 2007. Is 223 a prime number? Let me check. 223 divided by 2 is not an integer, 223 divided by 3 is 74.333, which isn't an integer. 5? 223 divided by 5 is 44.6, nope. 7? 223 divided by 7 is about 31.85, not an integer. 11? 20.27, nope. 13? 17.15, nope. 17? 13.11, nope. So, I think 223 is prime. So, the prime factorization of 2007 is 3^2 * 223^1.Therefore, the factors of 2007 are 1, 3, 9, 223, 669, and 2007. So, the possible pairs (a, b) where a * b = 2007 are:(1, 2007), (3, 669), (9, 223), (223, 9), (669, 3), (2007, 1).But since a and b must be greater than 1 (because x and y are positive integers), we can exclude the pairs where a or b is 1. So, the valid pairs are:(3, 669), (9, 223), (223, 9), (669, 3).Now, each of these pairs corresponds to (x + 1, y + 1). So, to find x and y, we subtract 1 from each component.For (3, 669): x = 3 - 1 = 2, y = 669 - 1 = 668. So, (2, 668).For (9, 223): x = 9 - 1 = 8, y = 223 - 1 = 222. So, (8, 222).For (223, 9): x = 223 - 1 = 222, y = 9 - 1 = 8. So, (222, 8).For (669, 3): x = 669 - 1 = 668, y = 3 - 1 = 2. So, (668, 2).So, the possible pairs (x, y) are (2, 668), (8, 222), (222, 8), and (668, 2). Wait, let me double-check these solutions to make sure they satisfy the original equation.First, (2, 668): 2 + 668 + (2)(668) = 2 + 668 + 1336 = 2006. Correct.Next, (8, 222): 8 + 222 + (8)(222) = 8 + 222 + 1776 = 2006. Correct.Similarly, (222, 8): 222 + 8 + (222)(8) = 222 + 8 + 1776 = 2006. Correct.And (668, 2): 668 + 2 + (668)(2) = 668 + 2 + 1336 = 2006. Correct.Okay, so all these pairs satisfy the equation. I think that's all the possible pairs because we considered all factor pairs of 2007 greater than 1, and each gave us a valid solution when we subtracted 1. So, I don't think I missed any.**Final Answer**The pairs of positive integers are boxed{(2, 668)}, boxed{(668, 2)}, boxed{(8, 222)}, and boxed{(222, 8)}."},{"question":"Within triangle ( ABC ), a point ( K ) is located on the angle bisector of (angle BAC).

Prove that points ( P ), ( Q ), and ( M ) are collinear.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to visualize and understand all the given information step by step.We have triangle ( ABC ) with a point ( K ) on the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ). That means ( K ) is somewhere along the line that splits ( angle BAC ) into two equal angles. Then, line ( CK ) intersects the circumcircle ( omega ) of triangle ( ABC ) again at point ( M ). So, ( M ) is the second intersection point of ( CK ) with the circumcircle.Next, there's a circle ( Omega ) that passes through point ( A ), is tangent to line ( CM ) at point ( K ), intersects segment ( AB ) again at point ( P ), and intersects ( omega ) again at point ( Q ). We need to prove that points ( P ), ( Q ), and ( M ) are collinear.Alright, let me try to break this down. First, I should probably draw a diagram to get a better sense of the problem. Since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine it.So, triangle ( ABC ), with ( K ) on the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ). Then ( CK ) meets the circumcircle again at ( M ). Circle ( Omega ) goes through ( A ) and is tangent to ( CM ) at ( K ). It also intersects ( AB ) again at ( P ) and the circumcircle ( omega ) again at ( Q ).I think the key here is to use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, tangent circles, and maybe some angle chasing.Let me recall that if a circle is tangent to a line at a point, then the tangent at that point is perpendicular to the radius. So, the radius of ( Omega ) at point ( K ) is perpendicular to ( CM ). That might be useful.Also, since ( Omega ) passes through ( A ) and ( K ), and is tangent to ( CM ) at ( K ), maybe there's some power of a point or something related to tangents that I can use.Another thought: since ( P ) is on both ( AB ) and ( Omega ), and ( Q ) is on both ( Omega ) and ( omega ), perhaps there's a way to relate these points through some cyclic quadrilateral properties.Let me try to do some angle chasing. Since ( Omega ) is tangent to ( CM ) at ( K ), the angle between ( CM ) and ( Omega ) at ( K ) is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. Wait, that's the tangent-chord angle theorem. So, ( angle MKP = angle KAP ), where ( P ) is another point on ( Omega ).Hmm, let me write that down:( angle MKP = angle KAP ).Since ( P ) is on ( AB ), this might relate to some angles in triangle ( ABC ).Also, since ( K ) is on the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ), maybe we can use properties related to angle bisectors, like the Angle Bisector Theorem.Wait, but I'm not sure how that would directly apply here. Maybe I need to consider more points or lines.Another idea: since ( M ) is on the circumcircle ( omega ), maybe I can relate angles at ( M ) with angles at ( A ) or ( B ) or ( C ).Also, since ( Q ) is another intersection point of ( Omega ) and ( omega ), perhaps there's a radical axis or something involved.But maybe I should focus on the angles first.Let me try to consider triangle ( AKP ). Since ( P ) is on ( Omega ), which passes through ( A ) and ( K ), and is tangent to ( CM ) at ( K ), we have that ( angle KAP = angle MKP ) as per the tangent-chord angle theorem.So, ( angle KAP = angle MKP ).Now, since ( P ) is on ( AB ), ( angle KAP ) is just ( angle KAB ), which is part of ( angle BAC ). Since ( K ) is on the angle bisector, ( angle KAB = angle KAC ).Wait, but ( angle KAP = angle MKP ), so ( angle MKP = angle KAC ).Is there a way to relate ( angle MKP ) to another angle in the diagram?Maybe considering triangle ( MKP ) and triangle ( KAC ). If I can find some similarity or congruence, that might help.Alternatively, maybe I can look at cyclic quadrilaterals. Since ( A ), ( P ), ( K ), and ( Q ) are on ( Omega ), quadrilateral ( APKQ ) is cyclic. So, ( angle APK = angle AQL ) or something like that. Wait, not sure.Wait, actually, since ( Q ) is on both ( Omega ) and ( omega ), maybe there's a way to relate angles at ( Q ).Alternatively, perhaps I can use power of a point. Let me consider point ( C ). The power of ( C ) with respect to ( Omega ) should be equal to ( CK^2 ) because ( CK ) is tangent to ( Omega ) at ( K ). So, power of ( C ) with respect to ( Omega ) is ( CK^2 ).On the other hand, the power of ( C ) with respect to ( Omega ) can also be expressed as ( CP cdot CA ) because ( C ) lies outside ( Omega ) and ( CP ) and ( CA ) are the lengths from ( C ) to the points of intersection with ( Omega ).So, ( CK^2 = CP cdot CA ).Hmm, that's an interesting relation. Maybe I can use that later.Now, let me think about point ( M ). Since ( M ) is on the circumcircle ( omega ) of ( ABC ), and ( M ) is also on line ( CK ), perhaps there's some cyclic quadrilateral properties involving ( M ).Also, since ( Q ) is the other intersection point of ( Omega ) and ( omega ), maybe ( AQ ) is significant.Wait, perhaps I can use radical axes. The radical axis of ( omega ) and ( Omega ) is line ( AQ ) because ( A ) and ( Q ) are the intersection points. So, the radical axis is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of ( omega ) and ( Omega ).But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can use inversion. But that might be too complicated for now.Let me go back to the angle chasing. Since ( angle MKP = angle KAP ), and ( angle KAP = angle KAC ) because ( K ) is on the angle bisector, so ( angle MKP = angle KAC ).Also, since ( M ) is on the circumcircle ( omega ), ( angle KAC = angle KMC ) because they subtend the same arc ( KC ).Wait, is that correct? Let me think.In circle ( omega ), points ( A ), ( B ), ( C ), ( M ) lie on it. So, ( angle KAC ) is equal to ( angle KMC ) because both angles subtend arc ( KC ).Yes, that seems right.So, ( angle KAC = angle KMC ).But we also have ( angle MKP = angle KAC ), so substituting, ( angle MKP = angle KMC ).Hmm, so ( angle MKP = angle KMC ).That suggests that points ( P ), ( K ), ( M ), and ( C ) lie on a circle? Wait, no, because ( angle MKP = angle KMC ), which might imply that lines ( PK ) and ( MC ) are parallel?Wait, if two angles are equal and they are alternate interior angles, then the lines are parallel.So, if ( angle MKP = angle KMC ), then line ( PK ) is parallel to line ( MC ).Is that correct? Let me see.Yes, because if you have two lines cut by a transversal, and the alternate interior angles are equal, then the lines are parallel.So, ( PK parallel MC ).That's a useful piece of information.Now, if ( PK parallel MC ), then the angles formed by a transversal with these lines will be equal.So, for example, ( angle PKM = angle KCM ).But I'm not sure yet how to use this.Wait, maybe I can consider triangle ( PKM ) and triangle ( KCM ). Since ( PK parallel MC ), these triangles might be similar.But I need to check the angles.Alternatively, since ( PK parallel MC ), the ratio of segments might be preserved.But perhaps I should look for another angle relation.Let me think about point ( Q ). Since ( Q ) is on both ( Omega ) and ( omega ), maybe I can relate angles at ( Q ).In circle ( omega ), ( angle CQM = angle CAM ) because they subtend the same arc ( CM ).Similarly, in circle ( Omega ), ( angle CQP = angle CAP ) because they subtend the same arc ( CP ).Wait, but ( angle CAP = angle KAP ) because ( P ) is on ( AB ) and ( K ) is on the angle bisector.But earlier, we had ( angle KAP = angle MKP ), so ( angle CAP = angle MKP ).Hmm, maybe I can relate these angles.Wait, let me try to write down the angles:In ( omega ): ( angle CQM = angle CAM ).In ( Omega ): ( angle CQP = angle CAP ).But ( angle CAP = angle KAP = angle MKP ).So, ( angle CQP = angle MKP ).But ( angle MKP = angle KMC ) as we saw earlier.So, ( angle CQP = angle KMC ).Hmm, interesting.Now, if I can relate ( angle CQP ) and ( angle KMC ), maybe I can find that points ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) are collinear.Wait, if ( angle CQP = angle KMC ), then perhaps lines ( PQ ) and ( KM ) are related in some way.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that ( PK parallel MC ) to find some similar triangles or something.Wait, since ( PK parallel MC ), then ( angle PKM = angle KCM ).But ( angle PKM ) is also equal to ( angle PQM ) if ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) are collinear.Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.Let me try a different approach. Since ( PK parallel MC ), the line ( PK ) is parallel to ( MC ). So, if I can show that ( Q ) lies on line ( PM ), then ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) would be collinear.Alternatively, maybe I can use Menelaus' theorem or something similar.Wait, Menelaus' theorem applies to a transversal cutting through the sides of a triangle. Maybe I can consider triangle ( ACM ) with transversal ( PK ).But I'm not sure.Alternatively, since ( PK parallel MC ), the ratio ( frac{AP}{PB} = frac{AK}{KC} ) by the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem).Wait, but ( K ) is on the angle bisector, so by the Angle Bisector Theorem, ( frac{AK}{KC} = frac{AB}{BC} ).But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Wait, let me recall that ( CK ) meets the circumcircle again at ( M ). So, ( M ) is the midpoint of the arc ( BC ) or something? Not necessarily, unless ( K ) is the midpoint, which it isn't necessarily.Wait, but ( K ) is on the angle bisector, so maybe ( M ) has some special property.Alternatively, perhaps I can use power of a point from point ( P ).Since ( P ) is on ( Omega ), and ( Omega ) is tangent to ( CM ) at ( K ), the power of ( P ) with respect to ( Omega ) is zero. Wait, no, ( P ) is on ( Omega ), so its power is zero.But ( P ) is also on ( AB ), so maybe I can relate the power of ( P ) with respect to ( omega ).Wait, the power of ( P ) with respect to ( omega ) is ( PA cdot PB ) because ( P ) lies on ( AB ), which is a chord of ( omega ).But ( P ) is also on ( Omega ), so the power of ( P ) with respect to ( omega ) is also equal to ( PQ cdot PA ) because ( P ) and ( Q ) are the intersection points of ( Omega ) and ( omega ).Wait, no, the power of ( P ) with respect to ( omega ) is ( PA cdot PB ), and also ( PQ cdot PA ) because ( P ) is on ( Omega ) and ( Q ) is the other intersection point.Wait, actually, the power of ( P ) with respect to ( omega ) is ( PA cdot PB ), and the power of ( P ) with respect to ( Omega ) is ( PK^2 ) because ( PK ) is tangent to ( Omega ) at ( K ).Wait, no, ( PK ) is not necessarily tangent to ( Omega ). Wait, ( Omega ) is tangent to ( CM ) at ( K ), not necessarily to ( PK ).Hmm, maybe I confused something.Wait, ( Omega ) is tangent to ( CM ) at ( K ), so the tangent at ( K ) is ( CM ). Therefore, the power of ( P ) with respect to ( Omega ) is ( PK^2 ) only if ( PK ) is tangent, which it isn't necessarily.Wait, no, the power of ( P ) with respect to ( Omega ) is ( PA cdot PP ) but ( P ) is on ( Omega ), so its power is zero. That doesn't help.Wait, maybe I should use the power of ( C ) with respect to ( Omega ). Earlier, I thought ( CK^2 = CP cdot CA ). Let me verify that.Yes, because ( C ) lies outside ( Omega ), and ( CK ) is tangent to ( Omega ) at ( K ), so the power of ( C ) with respect to ( Omega ) is ( CK^2 ). Also, ( C ) lies on ( CM ), which intersects ( Omega ) at ( K ) and ( M ). Wait, no, ( M ) is on ( omega ), not necessarily on ( Omega ). So, the power of ( C ) with respect to ( Omega ) is ( CK^2 = CP cdot CA ).So, ( CK^2 = CP cdot CA ).That's a useful relation.Now, let me think about triangle ( ABC ) and point ( M ). Since ( M ) is on the circumcircle, ( angle AMC = angle ABC ) because they subtend the same arc ( AC ).Wait, is that correct? Let me think.In circle ( omega ), ( angle AMC = angle ABC ) because both angles subtend arc ( AC ).Yes, that's correct.So, ( angle AMC = angle ABC ).Now, let me consider triangle ( PKM ). Since ( PK parallel MC ), as we established earlier, then ( angle PKM = angle KCM ).But ( angle KCM = angle KCB ) because ( C ), ( K ), ( B ) are colinear? Wait, no, ( K ) is on the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ), so ( K ) is inside the triangle.Wait, maybe I should think differently.Since ( PK parallel MC ), then ( angle PKM = angle KCM ).But ( angle KCM ) is equal to ( angle KCB ) because they are the same angle.Wait, no, ( angle KCM ) is the angle at ( C ) between ( CM ) and ( CK ).Hmm, maybe I can relate this to some other angle.Wait, let me think about triangle ( KCM ). Since ( PK parallel MC ), then triangle ( PKM ) is similar to triangle ( KCM ) by AA similarity because they have equal angles.Wait, if ( PK parallel MC ), then ( angle PKM = angle KCM ) and ( angle KPM = angle CMC ). Wait, not sure.Wait, maybe it's better to consider the ratio of sides.Since ( PK parallel MC ), by the basic proportionality theorem, ( frac{AP}{PB} = frac{AK}{KC} ).But ( K ) is on the angle bisector, so by the Angle Bisector Theorem, ( frac{AK}{KC} = frac{AB}{BC} ).So, ( frac{AP}{PB} = frac{AB}{BC} ).Hmm, that gives a ratio involving ( AP ) and ( PB ).But I'm not sure how that helps with collinearity.Wait, maybe I can use Ceva's Theorem. If I can find concurrent lines, but I don't see an immediate application.Alternatively, maybe I can use Menelaus' Theorem on triangle ( ACM ) with transversal ( PK ).Wait, Menelaus' Theorem states that for a triangle ( ACM ) and a transversal line that intersects ( AC ) at ( R ), ( CM ) at ( S ), and ( AM ) at ( T ), the product of the ratios is 1.But in our case, the transversal would be ( PK ), but I don't know where it intersects ( AM ).Alternatively, maybe I can use Menelaus on triangle ( ABC ) with transversal ( PKM ). Wait, but I don't know if ( PKM ) is a straight line.Wait, that's what we're trying to prove: that ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) are collinear. So, maybe I can't use Menelaus directly.Wait, perhaps I can use the radical axis theorem. The radical axis of two circles is the set of points with equal power with respect to both circles. So, the radical axis of ( omega ) and ( Omega ) is line ( AQ ), since ( A ) and ( Q ) are the intersection points.But if I can show that ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) lie on a line that is the radical axis, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.Wait, but ( M ) is on ( omega ), and ( Q ) is on both ( omega ) and ( Omega ). So, ( Q ) is on the radical axis. If I can show that ( P ) is also on the radical axis, then ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) would be collinear.Wait, but ( P ) is on ( Omega ), so its power with respect to ( Omega ) is zero. Its power with respect to ( omega ) is ( PA cdot PB ). For ( P ) to be on the radical axis, its power with respect to both circles must be equal, so ( PA cdot PB = 0 ), which is not necessarily true unless ( P ) is ( A ) or ( B ), which it isn't.So, that approach might not work.Wait, maybe I can use harmonic division or something related to projective geometry, but that might be too advanced.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that ( PK parallel MC ) to find some similar triangles that can help me relate ( P ), ( Q ), and ( M ).Wait, let me think about point ( Q ). Since ( Q ) is on both ( Omega ) and ( omega ), maybe I can relate angles at ( Q ) involving ( P ) and ( M ).In circle ( omega ), ( angle CQM = angle CAM ) because they subtend the same arc ( CM ).In circle ( Omega ), ( angle CQP = angle CAP ) because they subtend the same arc ( CP ).But ( angle CAP = angle KAP = angle MKP ), as we saw earlier.So, ( angle CQP = angle MKP ).But ( angle MKP = angle KMC ) because ( PK parallel MC ).So, ( angle CQP = angle KMC ).Hmm, so ( angle CQP = angle KMC ).Now, if I can show that ( angle KMC = angle QMP ), then ( angle CQP = angle QMP ), which would imply that ( Q ), ( M ), ( P ) are collinear because the angles would be equal, suggesting that ( Q ) lies on line ( PM ).Wait, but I'm not sure if ( angle KMC = angle QMP ).Wait, let me think about triangle ( KMC ). Since ( PK parallel MC ), then ( angle KMC = angle PKM ).But ( angle PKM ) is equal to ( angle PQM ) if ( Q ) lies on line ( PM ).Wait, maybe I'm getting somewhere.Let me try to write this down:Since ( PK parallel MC ), ( angle PKM = angle KMC ).If ( Q ) lies on line ( PM ), then ( angle PKM = angle PQM ).But we have ( angle CQP = angle KMC ), which is equal to ( angle PKM ).So, ( angle CQP = angle PKM ).If ( Q ) lies on ( PM ), then ( angle CQP = angle PQM ), which would be equal to ( angle PKM ).Therefore, this suggests that ( Q ) must lie on line ( PM ), making ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) collinear.Wait, that seems a bit hand-wavy. Let me try to formalize it.Since ( PK parallel MC ), ( angle PKM = angle KMC ).In circle ( Omega ), ( angle CQP = angle CAP ).But ( angle CAP = angle KAP = angle MKP ).So, ( angle CQP = angle MKP ).But ( angle MKP = angle PKM ) because they are the same angle.Wait, no, ( angle MKP ) is at ( K ), while ( angle PKM ) is at ( K ) as well. Wait, no, ( angle MKP ) is at ( K ), between ( M ), ( K ), ( P ), and ( angle PKM ) is at ( K ), between ( P ), ( K ), ( M ). So, they are the same angle.Wait, no, ( angle MKP ) is at ( K ), between ( M ), ( K ), ( P ), and ( angle PKM ) is at ( K ), between ( P ), ( K ), ( M ). So, they are the same angle.Wait, that can't be right because ( angle MKP ) is equal to ( angle KAP ), which is equal to ( angle KAC ), which is equal to ( angle KMC ).Wait, I'm getting confused with the notation.Let me try to clarify:- ( angle MKP ) is the angle at ( K ) between ( M ), ( K ), ( P ).- ( angle PKM ) is the angle at ( K ) between ( P ), ( K ), ( M ).So, they are the same angle.Therefore, ( angle CQP = angle PKM ).But ( angle PKM = angle KMC ) because ( PK parallel MC ).So, ( angle CQP = angle KMC ).Now, in triangle ( KMC ), ( angle KMC ) is at ( M ), between ( K ), ( M ), ( C ).But ( angle CQP ) is at ( Q ), between ( C ), ( Q ), ( P ).If ( Q ) lies on line ( PM ), then ( angle CQP ) would be equal to ( angle KMC ), which is the case here.Therefore, ( Q ) must lie on line ( PM ), making ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) collinear.Wait, that seems to make sense.So, to summarize:1. Since ( Omega ) is tangent to ( CM ) at ( K ), ( angle MKP = angle KAP ).2. ( K ) is on the angle bisector, so ( angle KAP = angle KAC ).3. In circle ( omega ), ( angle KAC = angle KMC ) because they subtend the same arc.4. Therefore, ( angle MKP = angle KMC ).5. This implies ( PK parallel MC ) because the alternate interior angles are equal.6. In circle ( Omega ), ( angle CQP = angle CAP ).7. ( angle CAP = angle KAP = angle MKP ).8. Therefore, ( angle CQP = angle MKP = angle KMC ).9. Since ( PK parallel MC ), ( angle KMC = angle PKM ).10. Thus, ( angle CQP = angle PKM ), implying that ( Q ) lies on line ( PM ).11. Hence, ( P ), ( Q ), ( M ) are collinear.I think that covers the necessary steps. I might have skipped some details, but overall, the key idea is using the tangent-chord angle theorem, angle bisector properties, and parallel lines to establish the collinearity."},{"question":"Given a complex number z satisfies z=1-i, then the modulus of z is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given a complex number z equals 1 minus i, I need to find the modulus of z. Hmm, modulus... I think that's like the distance from the origin in the complex plane, right? So, if I remember correctly, for any complex number a plus bi, the modulus is the square root of (a squared plus b squared). Let me write that down to make sure I got it right.So, z is 1 minus i, which means a is 1 and b is -1, because the imaginary part is negative. Plugging those into the formula, I get the modulus of z is the square root of (1 squared plus (-1) squared). Let me calculate that step by step. 1 squared is 1, and (-1) squared is also 1, because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, adding those together, I get 1 plus 1, which is 2. Then, taking the square root of 2, that's approximately 1.414, but I think the exact value is just the square root of 2.Wait, let me double-check. If z is 1 minus i, then in the complex plane, it's located at the point (1, -1). The modulus is the distance from the origin to that point, which is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. So, yes, the distance would be the square root of (1 squared plus (-1) squared), which is indeed the square root of 2. I don't think I made any mistakes there.Just to be thorough, let me visualize it. On the complex plane, the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is -1, so it's in the fourth quadrant. Drawing a right triangle from the origin to the point (1, -1), the legs are both length 1, so the hypotenuse, which is the modulus, should be the square root of (1^2 + 1^2) = square root of 2. Yep, that makes sense.I guess another way to think about it is that the modulus is like the magnitude of the vector representing the complex number. So, if I have a vector pointing to (1, -1), its length is the square root of 2. That's consistent with what I've calculated.Is there another method to find the modulus? Maybe using Euler's formula or something? Hmm, I don't think that's necessary here because we have a straightforward expression for z. Euler's formula is more for when you have the complex number in polar form, like r times e^(iŒ∏). In this case, since we have it in rectangular form, a + bi, the modulus is just the square root of (a^2 + b^2).Let me also recall that the modulus has some properties, like |z1 * z2| = |z1| * |z2| and |z1 + z2| ‚â§ |z1| + |z2|. But those properties aren't directly needed here; I just need to compute the modulus of a single complex number.So, to summarize, z is 1 - i, which is 1 plus (-1)i. The modulus is the square root of (1^2 + (-1)^2) = square root of 2. That seems straightforward. I don't think I've missed anything here. It's a basic application of the modulus formula for complex numbers.Wait, just to make sure I didn't confuse modulus with something else, like the argument. The argument is the angle it makes with the positive real axis, right? For z = 1 - i, the argument would be -45 degrees or 315 degrees, but that's not what the question is asking. It specifically asks for the modulus, so I'm good.Another thing to consider: sometimes people get confused between the modulus and the complex conjugate. The complex conjugate of z = a + bi is a - bi, which in this case would be 1 + i. But again, that's not what we're looking for here. We're looking for the modulus, which is a scalar value representing the distance from the origin.I think I've covered all the bases here. The modulus is definitely the square root of 2. I don't see any reason to doubt that calculation. It's a fundamental concept in complex numbers, and I think I've applied it correctly.Just to recap in my head: complex number z = a + bi, modulus |z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Applied to z = 1 - i, so a = 1, b = -1. Therefore, |z| = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). Yep, that's solid.I guess the only thing left is to present the answer in the required format. The problem says to put the final answer within boxed{}, so I'll make sure to do that. No need for any additional explanations or steps beyond what I've already done.In conclusion, after carefully thinking through the problem and verifying each step, I'm confident that the modulus of z = 1 - i is indeed the square root of 2."},{"question":"Given sin alpha - 2cos alpha = 0, find  (1) frac {2sin alpha + cos alpha}{sin alpha -3cos alpha};  (2) 2sin alpha cos alpha.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given that sin Œ± minus 2 cos Œ± equals zero, and I need to find two things: the first is this fraction (2 sin Œ± + cos Œ±) divided by (sin Œ± - 3 cos Œ±), and the second is 2 sin Œ± cos Œ±. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.Starting with the given equation: sin Œ± - 2 cos Œ± = 0. Maybe I can rearrange this to find a relationship between sin Œ± and cos Œ±. If I move the 2 cos Œ± to the other side, I get sin Œ± = 2 cos Œ±. That seems useful because it relates sin and cos directly. So, sin Œ± is twice cos Œ±. I remember that tan Œ± is sin Œ± over cos Œ±, so if sin Œ± is 2 cos Œ±, then tan Œ± would be 2 cos Œ± divided by cos Œ±, which simplifies to 2. So, tan Œ± equals 2. That's good because maybe I can express everything in terms of tan Œ± to solve the first part.Looking at the first part: (2 sin Œ± + cos Œ±) / (sin Œ± - 3 cos Œ±). Since I have tan Œ± = 2, which is sin Œ± / cos Œ± = 2, I can express sin Œ± as 2 cos Œ±. Let me substitute that into the numerator and denominator.So, substituting sin Œ± = 2 cos Œ± into the numerator: 2*(2 cos Œ±) + cos Œ± = 4 cos Œ± + cos Œ± = 5 cos Œ±. In the denominator: (2 cos Œ±) - 3 cos Œ± = -cos Œ±.So now, the fraction becomes (5 cos Œ±) / (-cos Œ±). The cos Œ± terms cancel out, leaving 5 / (-1) which is -5. So, the first part is -5.Alright, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the second part: 2 sin Œ± cos Œ±. I need to find the value of this expression. Since I have tan Œ± = 2, maybe I can find sin Œ± and cos Œ± individually.I remember that tan Œ± = opposite / adjacent in a right triangle, so if tan Œ± = 2, I can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is 2 and the adjacent side is 1. Then, the hypotenuse would be sqrt(2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So, sin Œ± is opposite over hypotenuse, which is 2 / sqrt(5), and cos Œ± is adjacent over hypotenuse, which is 1 / sqrt(5). But wait, I should rationalize the denominators. So, sin Œ± is (2 sqrt(5)) / 5 and cos Œ± is (sqrt(5)) / 5.Now, plugging these into 2 sin Œ± cos Œ±: 2 * (2 sqrt(5)/5) * (sqrt(5)/5). Let's compute that step by step.First, multiply 2 and (2 sqrt(5)/5): that gives (4 sqrt(5))/5. Then, multiply that by (sqrt(5)/5): (4 sqrt(5) * sqrt(5)) / (5 * 5). Simplifying sqrt(5) * sqrt(5) is 5, so the numerator becomes 4 * 5 = 20, and the denominator is 25. So, 20/25 simplifies to 4/5.Wait, but hold on a second. When I considered the right triangle, I assumed that both sin Œ± and cos Œ± are positive. But depending on the quadrant where Œ± is, they could be negative. The original equation was sin Œ± - 2 cos Œ± = 0, which implies sin Œ± = 2 cos Œ±. If cos Œ± is positive, sin Œ± is positive, so Œ± is in the first quadrant. If cos Œ± is negative, sin Œ± is also negative, so Œ± is in the third quadrant. However, in both cases, when I compute 2 sin Œ± cos Œ±, whether sin and cos are positive or negative, their product will be positive because negative times negative is positive. So, regardless of the quadrant, 2 sin Œ± cos Œ± is positive 4/5.So, putting it all together, the first part is -5, and the second part is 4/5.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{-5}(2) boxed{dfrac{4}{5}}"},{"question":"A van takes 6 hours to cover a certain distance.

Hmm, that means I need to find the value of x such that when I plug it into f(x), I get 6. So, essentially, I need to solve the equation 1 + x¬≤ + log‚ÇÇx = 6.Alright, let me write that down:1 + x¬≤ + log‚ÇÇx = 6First, I can subtract 1 from both sides to simplify it a bit:x¬≤ + log‚ÇÇx = 5Now, I need to solve for x. This equation has both x squared and a logarithm, which makes it a bit tricky. I don't think I can solve this algebraically in a straightforward way because it's a transcendental equation. Maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for x to see if I can find a solution.Let me start with x = 2:x = 2Plugging into the equation:2¬≤ + log‚ÇÇ2 = 4 + 1 = 5Oh, that works! So when x = 2, the equation equals 5, which is exactly what we have. So that means f(2) = 6, right?Wait, let me double-check:f(2) = 1 + (2)¬≤ + log‚ÇÇ2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6Yes, that's correct. So f(2) = 6, which means that f‚Åª¬π(6) = 2.But just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there are any other solutions. Let's try x = 1:x = 11¬≤ + log‚ÇÇ1 = 1 + 0 = 1That's way too low. What about x = 3:3¬≤ + log‚ÇÇ3 = 9 + approximately 1.58496 = about 10.58496That's way higher than 5. So between x=2 and x=3, the function increases from 5 to about 10.58, so there's no other integer solution there.What about x = ‚àö(5 - log‚ÇÇx)? Hmm, that seems recursive because x is on both sides. Maybe I can try another approach.Alternatively, I can consider the behavior of the function f(x). Since x¬≤ grows quickly and log‚ÇÇx grows slowly, the function f(x) is increasing for x > 0 because both x¬≤ and log‚ÇÇx are increasing functions. Therefore, there should be only one solution to the equation f(x) = 6, which is x = 2.Wait, is that true? Let me think about the derivative to confirm if it's strictly increasing.The derivative of f(x) is f‚Äô(x) = 2x + 1/(x ln2). Since x > 0, both terms 2x and 1/(x ln2) are positive, so f‚Äô(x) is always positive. That means f(x) is strictly increasing for x > 0, so there can only be one x such that f(x) = 6. Since we found x=2 works, that must be the only solution.Therefore, f‚Åª¬π(6) is indeed 2.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I checked the value at x=2, confirmed it works, checked the behavior of the function to ensure it's strictly increasing, so no other solutions exist. Yeah, I'm confident the answer is 2."},{"question":"The equation of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = x^3 + x^2 at the point (1, f(1)) is ____.","answer":"First, I need to find the point on the curve ( f(x) = x^3 + x^2 ) where ( x = 1 ).

It says that the roots of this equation are (sin theta) and (cos theta). I need to prove that (cos 2beta = 2cos 2alpha). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that for any quadratic equation of the form (x^2 + bx + c = 0), the sum of the roots is (-b) and the product of the roots is (c). So, in this case, the sum of the roots (sin theta + cos theta) should be equal to (2sin alpha), right? Because the equation is (x^2 - 2sin alpha cdot x + sin^2 beta = 0), so (b = -2sin alpha), so the sum is (-b = 2sin alpha). Got that.Similarly, the product of the roots (sin theta cdot cos theta) should be equal to (sin^2 beta). So, that gives me two equations:1. (sin theta + cos theta = 2sin alpha)2. (sin theta cos theta = sin^2 beta)Now, I need to relate these to (cos 2beta) and (cos 2alpha). I remember that there are double-angle identities in trigonometry. Specifically, (cos 2theta = 1 - 2sin^2 theta) or (cos 2theta = 2cos^2 theta - 1). Maybe these will come in handy.Let me see. Maybe if I square the first equation, I can use the Pythagorean identity (sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1). Let's try that.Squaring both sides of the first equation:((sin theta + cos theta)^2 = (2sin alpha)^2)Expanding the left side:(sin^2 theta + 2sin theta cos theta + cos^2 theta = 4sin^2 alpha)Now, I know that (sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1), so substituting that in:(1 + 2sin theta cos theta = 4sin^2 alpha)But from the second equation, I know that (sin theta cos theta = sin^2 beta). So, substituting that in:(1 + 2sin^2 beta = 4sin^2 alpha)Hmm, okay. Let me rearrange this equation:(2sin^2 beta = 4sin^2 alpha - 1)Divide both sides by 2:(sin^2 beta = 2sin^2 alpha - frac{1}{2})Now, I need to relate this to (cos 2beta) and (cos 2alpha). Let's recall the double-angle identity for cosine:(cos 2beta = 1 - 2sin^2 beta)Similarly, (cos 2alpha = 1 - 2sin^2 alpha)So, let's express (sin^2 beta) and (sin^2 alpha) in terms of (cos 2beta) and (cos 2alpha):From (cos 2beta = 1 - 2sin^2 beta), we can solve for (sin^2 beta):(sin^2 beta = frac{1 - cos 2beta}{2})Similarly, from (cos 2alpha = 1 - 2sin^2 alpha), we get:(sin^2 alpha = frac{1 - cos 2alpha}{2})Now, let's substitute these back into the equation we had earlier:(sin^2 beta = 2sin^2 alpha - frac{1}{2})Substituting the expressions for (sin^2 beta) and (sin^2 alpha):(frac{1 - cos 2beta}{2} = 2 cdot frac{1 - cos 2alpha}{2} - frac{1}{2})Simplify the right side:First, (2 cdot frac{1 - cos 2alpha}{2} = 1 - cos 2alpha)So, the equation becomes:(frac{1 - cos 2beta}{2} = 1 - cos 2alpha - frac{1}{2})Simplify the right side further:(1 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}), so:(frac{1 - cos 2beta}{2} = frac{1}{2} - cos 2alpha)Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:(1 - cos 2beta = 1 - 2cos 2alpha)Now, subtract 1 from both sides:(-cos 2beta = -2cos 2alpha)Multiply both sides by -1:(cos 2beta = 2cos 2alpha)And that's exactly what we needed to prove! So, by using the sum and product of roots, squaring the sum, applying the Pythagorean identity, and then using the double-angle identities, we arrived at the desired result.I think that covers all the steps. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip anything important. We started with the quadratic equation, used Vieta's formulas to get the sum and product of the roots, squared the sum to involve the Pythagorean identity, substituted the product of the roots, and then used double-angle identities to relate everything to (cos 2beta) and (cos 2alpha). It all fits together nicely. I don't see any mistakes in the algebra or the trigonometric identities used.

Calculate the exact value of ( f(-1.5) + f(1.5) + g(-1.5) + g(1.5) ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the exact value of ( f(-1.5) + f(1.5) + g(-1.5) + g(1.5) ). The functions ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) are given, with ( f(x) ) being an odd function because it satisfies ( f(-x) = -f(x) ), and ( g(x) ) is a parabola, which I assume is an even function. First, let me recall what it means for a function to be odd or even. An odd function has the property that ( f(-x) = -f(x) ), which means if I plug in a negative value, it's the same as the negative of the function at the positive value. A classic example is ( f(x) = x ). On the other hand, an even function has the property that ( g(-x) = g(x) ), meaning the function is symmetric about the y-axis. A common example is ( g(x) = x^2 ).Given that ( f(x) ) is odd, I can use this property to simplify ( f(-1.5) + f(1.5) ). Let me write that out:[ f(-1.5) + f(1.5) = (-f(1.5)) + f(1.5) ]Hmm, that simplifies to:[ (-f(1.5)) + f(1.5) = 0 ]So, the sum of ( f(-1.5) ) and ( f(1.5) ) is zero. That takes care of the ( f ) part of the problem.Now, moving on to ( g(x) ). Since ( g(x) ) is a parabola, it's an even function. That means ( g(-1.5) = g(1.5) ). So, when I add ( g(-1.5) ) and ( g(1.5) ), I'm essentially adding the same value twice:[ g(-1.5) + g(1.5) = g(1.5) + g(1.5) = 2g(1.5) ]Okay, so I need to find the value of ( g(1.5) ) and then double it. But wait, I don't have the exact expression for ( g(x) ). However, looking back at the Asymptote code provided, I can see that ( g(x) ) is defined as:[ g(x) = frac{x^2}{4} - 1 ]Great, so now I can plug ( x = 1.5 ) into this function to find ( g(1.5) ).Let me compute that step by step. First, square 1.5:[ (1.5)^2 = 2.25 ]Next, divide that by 4:[ frac{2.25}{4} = 0.5625 ]Then, subtract 1:[ 0.5625 - 1 = -0.4375 ]So, ( g(1.5) = -0.4375 ). Since ( g(-1.5) = g(1.5) ), the sum ( g(-1.5) + g(1.5) ) is:[ -0.4375 + (-0.4375) = -0.875 ]Putting it all together, the total sum ( f(-1.5) + f(1.5) + g(-1.5) + g(1.5) ) is:[ 0 + (-0.875) = -0.875 ]Therefore, the exact value is (-0.875). I should make sure that my calculations are correct. Let me double-check the computation for ( g(1.5) ):- ( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 ) is correct.- Dividing 2.25 by 4 gives 0.5625, which is correct.- Subtracting 1 from 0.5625 gives -0.4375, which is correct.- Adding -0.4375 twice gives -0.875, which is correct.And since ( f(-1.5) + f(1.5) = 0 ) because ( f ) is odd, the total sum is indeed -0.875.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations.**Final Answer**boxed{-0.875}"},{"question":"In a right triangle PQR where angle R = 90^circ, the lengths of sides PQ = 15 and PR = 9. Find sin Q and cos Q.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a right triangle PQR where angle R is 90 degrees. The lengths of sides PQ and PR are given as 15 and 9 respectively. I need to find sin Q and cos Q. Hmm, right triangles and trigonometry... I think I remember some basics, but let me try to recall step by step.First, let me visualize the triangle. Since angle R is the right angle, that means sides PR and QR are the legs, and PQ is the hypotenuse. So, PR is one leg, QR is the other leg, and PQ is the hypotenuse opposite the right angle. Got it.Given that PQ is 15 and PR is 9, I need to find sin Q and cos Q. I remember that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse, and the cosine is the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse. So, for angle Q, I need to figure out which sides are opposite and adjacent.Let me label the triangle properly. Let's say point P is one vertex, Q is another, and R is the right angle. So, side PQ is opposite angle R, which is the hypotenuse. Side PR is opposite angle Q, and side QR is opposite angle P. Wait, no, actually, in triangle notation, side opposite angle P is QR, side opposite angle Q is PR, and side opposite angle R is PQ. Yeah, that makes sense because in triangle PQR, each side is named after the opposite angle.So, for angle Q, the opposite side would be PR, which is 9, and the adjacent side would be QR, which I don't know yet. The hypotenuse is PQ, which is 15. So, to find sin Q, I need opposite over hypotenuse, which is PR over PQ, so 9 over 15. But wait, I think I need to find QR first because maybe I can use that for cos Q.Right, cos Q is adjacent over hypotenuse, which would be QR over PQ. But I don't know QR yet. So, I need to find the length of QR. Since it's a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, PQ squared equals PR squared plus QR squared.Let me write that down:PQ¬≤ = PR¬≤ + QR¬≤Plugging in the known values:15¬≤ = 9¬≤ + QR¬≤Calculating the squares:225 = 81 + QR¬≤Subtracting 81 from both sides:225 - 81 = QR¬≤144 = QR¬≤Taking the square root of both sides:QR = ‚àö144 = 12Okay, so QR is 12 units long. Now that I have all the sides, I can find sin Q and cos Q.Starting with sin Q. As I thought earlier, sin Q is opposite over hypotenuse. The side opposite angle Q is PR, which is 9, and the hypotenuse is PQ, which is 15. So:sin Q = PR / PQ = 9 / 15I can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:9 √∑ 3 = 315 √∑ 3 = 5So, sin Q = 3/5.Now, for cos Q. Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. The side adjacent to angle Q is QR, which we found to be 12, and the hypotenuse is still 15. So:cos Q = QR / PQ = 12 / 15Again, simplifying the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:12 √∑ 3 = 415 √∑ 3 = 5So, cos Q = 4/5.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the sides. For angle Q, the opposite side is PR, which is 9, and the adjacent side is QR, which is 12. Yep, that seems right. So, sin Q is 3/5 and cos Q is 4/5. I think that's correct.Just to be thorough, I can also check using another method. Maybe using the definitions of sine and cosine in terms of the triangle's sides. Alternatively, I can think about the triangle's angles. Since angle R is 90 degrees, the other two angles, P and Q, must add up to 90 degrees. So, they are complementary. That means sin Q should equal cos P and cos Q should equal sin P. But I don't know angle P's sine or cosine, so maybe that's not helpful here.Alternatively, I can use the Pythagorean identity, which states that sin¬≤ Q + cos¬≤ Q = 1. Let's see if that holds with my results.Calculating sin¬≤ Q + cos¬≤ Q:(3/5)¬≤ + (4/5)¬≤ = 9/25 + 16/25 = 25/25 = 1Yes, that works out. So, my values for sin Q and cos Q satisfy the Pythagorean identity, which gives me more confidence that they're correct.Another way to verify is to consider the triangle's side lengths. If PR is 9, QR is 12, and PQ is 15, then 9-12-15 is a Pythagorean triple because 9¬≤ + 12¬≤ = 81 + 144 = 225 = 15¬≤. So, the sides are consistent with a right triangle, which is good.I think I've covered all the bases here. I found the missing side using the Pythagorean theorem, then applied the definitions of sine and cosine for angle Q. I also checked my work using the Pythagorean identity and confirmed that the side lengths form a valid right triangle. So, I'm pretty sure my answers are correct.Just to recap:- Identified the sides opposite and adjacent to angle Q.- Applied the Pythagorean theorem to find the unknown side QR.- Calculated sin Q as opposite over hypotenuse (9/15 = 3/5).- Calculated cos Q as adjacent over hypotenuse (12/15 = 4/5).- Verified using the Pythagorean identity.Yep, that all lines up. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning. So, I feel confident that sin Q is 3/5 and cos Q is 4/5."},{"question":"182 to 1 to 1000000000, find the sum of the digits of each number; then find the sum of the digits of the resulting 1 billion numbers, and continue this process until 1 billion single-digit numbers are obtained. Which digit appears more frequently, 1 or 2?","answer":"Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to analyze the frequency of the digits 1 and 2 after repeatedly summing the digits of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000,000 until I'm left with single-digit numbers. The goal is to determine whether 1 or 2 appears more frequently in the final set of numbers.First, I need to understand the process step by step. Starting with numbers from 1 to 1,000,000,000, I have to compute the sum of the digits for each number. Then, for each of these sums, I have to repeat the process‚Äîsumming their digits‚Äîuntil I end up with single-digit numbers. This means I'll be performing this digit-summing process multiple times until all numbers are reduced to single digits.I recall that the sum of the digits of a number has a special property related to modulo 9. Specifically, the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. This means that if I take a number, sum its digits, and then sum the digits of the result, and so on, I'll eventually get a single-digit number that is equivalent to the original number modulo 9. This single-digit number is often referred to as the \\"digital root\\" of the original number.Given this property, I can infer that each number from 1 to 1,000,000,000 will reduce to a single digit between 1 and 9, corresponding to its value modulo 9. For example, the number 10 will reduce to 1 (since 1 + 0 = 1), and the number 19 will reduce to 1 as well (1 + 9 = 10, then 1 + 0 = 1). Similarly, the number 2 will reduce to 2, and so on.Now, considering the range from 1 to 1,000,000,000, I need to determine how many numbers reduce to each digit from 1 to 9. Since the reduction is based on modulo 9, the distribution of these single-digit numbers should be roughly uniform, with each digit from 1 to 9 appearing approximately the same number of times. However, because 1,000,000,000 is not a multiple of 9, there might be a slight imbalance in the distribution.To calculate the exact distribution, I can divide the total count of numbers (1,000,000,000) by 9 to find out how many complete sets of 9 there are and then account for the remainder. 1,000,000,000 divided by 9 is approximately 111,111,111 with a remainder of 1. This means there are 111,111,111 complete sets of 9 numbers, each contributing one count to each digit from 1 to 9. Additionally, there is one extra number, which will contribute an extra count to the digit corresponding to the remainder.Since the remainder is 1, the digit 1 will have one more count than the other digits. Therefore, in the final set of single-digit numbers, the digit 1 will appear more frequently than the digit 2.To summarize, by leveraging the properties of modulo 9 and understanding the distribution of digital roots, I can conclude that the digit 1 will appear more frequently than the digit 2 in the final set of single-digit numbers obtained through repeated digit summing."},{"question":"There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 3 players quit.

Hmm, determinants can be tricky, especially with trigonometric functions. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that determinants are sensitive to linear dependencies among rows or columns. If any row or column is a linear combination of others, the determinant is zero. So maybe I can check if the columns are linearly dependent.Looking at the matrix, each row seems to follow a pattern: the first element is (sin n), the second is (sin(n+1)), and the third is (sin(n+2)), where (n) is 2, 5, and 8 for each respective row. That is, the first row is (sin 2, sin 3, sin 4), the second is (sin 5, sin 6, sin 7), and the third is (sin 8, sin 9, sin 10).I recall the sine addition formula: (sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b). Maybe I can use this to express (sin(n + 2)) in terms of (sin(n + 1)) and (sin n).Let me try that. Let's take the general case where we have (sin(n + 2)). Using the addition formula:[sin(n + 2) = sin((n + 1) + 1) = sin(n + 1)cos(1) + cos(n + 1)sin(1)]Hmm, that's one expression. But I wonder if I can express this in terms of just (sin(n + 1)) and (sin n). Maybe using another identity or rearranging terms.I remember another identity: (sin(n + 2) = 2cos(1)sin(n + 1) - sin n). Let me verify that.Starting from the addition formula:[sin(n + 2) = sin(n + 1 + 1) = sin(n + 1)cos(1) + cos(n + 1)sin(1)]But I also know that (cos(n + 1)) can be expressed using the identity (cos(n + 1) = cos n cos(1) - sin n sin(1)). Wait, that might complicate things. Maybe there's a simpler way.Alternatively, I recall that there's a recurrence relation for sine functions:[sin(n + 2) = 2cos(1)sin(n + 1) - sin n]Let me check this. If I use the identity for (sin(A + B)) and (sin(A - B)):[sin(A + B) + sin(A - B) = 2sin A cos B]Let me set (A = n + 1) and (B = 1). Then:[sin((n + 1) + 1) + sin((n + 1) - 1) = 2sin(n + 1)cos(1)]Simplifying:[sin(n + 2) + sin n = 2sin(n + 1)cos(1)]So, rearranging:[sin(n + 2) = 2cos(1)sin(n + 1) - sin n]Yes, that works! So, this recurrence relation allows me to express (sin(n + 2)) as a linear combination of (sin(n + 1)) and (sin n). That's useful because in the matrix, each third column element is (sin(n + 2)), which can be written in terms of the first two elements of the same row.Let me write this out for each row:1. For the first row ((n = 2)):   [   sin 4 = 2cos(1)sin 3 - sin 2   ]2. For the second row ((n = 5)):   [   sin 7 = 2cos(1)sin 6 - sin 5   ]3. For the third row ((n = 8)):   [   sin 10 = 2cos(1)sin 9 - sin 8   ]So, each element in the third column is a linear combination of the elements in the first and second columns of the same row. Specifically, the third column is equal to (2cos(1)) times the second column minus the first column.In terms of the matrix, this means that the third column can be expressed as:[text{Column 3} = 2cos(1) times text{Column 2} - text{Column 1}]Therefore, the third column is a linear combination of the first and second columns. When a column in a matrix is a linear combination of the other columns, the determinant of that matrix is zero. This is because the matrix is not full rank; its columns are linearly dependent.To confirm, let me recall the property of determinants: if one column (or row) can be expressed as a linear combination of others, the determinant is zero. Since the third column here is exactly that, the determinant must be zero.So, without even computing the determinant directly, I can conclude that it's zero because of the linear dependence among the columns.I think that's solid reasoning. I used the sine addition formula and a recurrence relation to express the third column in terms of the first two, which shows the linear dependence. Therefore, the determinant is zero.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"Calculate the value of 2^4 times 3^2 times 5^2 times 7 times 11.","answer":"I need to calculate the value of the expression (2^4 times 3^2 times 5^2 times 7 times 11).First, I'll compute each of the exponents separately:- (2^4 = 16)- (3^2 = 9)- (5^2 = 25)Now, I'll multiply these results together with the remaining numbers:- Multiply (16) by (9): (16 times 9 = 144)- Multiply (144) by (25): (144 times 25 = 3600)- Multiply (3600) by (7): (3600 times 7 = 25200)- Finally, multiply (25200) by (11): (25200 times 11 = 277200)So, the value of the expression is (277200)."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=|x|-cos x, for any x_1, x_2 in the interval [-œÄ,œÄ], the following conditions are provided:[‚ë†x_1 > |x_2|;] [‚ë°|x_1| > x_2;] [‚ë¢x_1^2 > x_2^2;] [‚ë£x_1^3 > x_2^3]Determine the sequence number(s) of the condition(s) that always ensure f(x_1) > f(x_2).

The conditions given are:1. x‚ÇÅ > |x‚ÇÇ|2. |x‚ÇÅ| > x‚ÇÇ3. x‚ÇÅ¬≤ > x‚ÇÇ¬≤4. x‚ÇÅ¬≥ > x‚ÇÇ¬≥Hmm, let me start by understanding the function f(x). It's composed of two parts: |x| and -cos x. Since both |x| and cos x are even functions, their combination should also be even, right? So f(x) is an even function, meaning f(-x) = f(x). That might be useful later.Next, I should probably analyze the behavior of f(x) on the interval [-œÄ, œÄ]. Since it's an even function, I can focus on [0, œÄ] and the behavior on [-œÄ, 0] will mirror that. Let me compute the derivative to see where the function is increasing or decreasing.f(x) = |x| - cos x. For x ‚â• 0, |x| is just x, so f(x) = x - cos x. The derivative f‚Äô(x) would be 1 + sin x. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: derivative of x is 1, derivative of -cos x is sin x. So yes, f‚Äô(x) = 1 + sin x.Now, sin x ranges between -1 and 1. So 1 + sin x ranges between 0 and 2. That means f‚Äô(x) is always non-negative on [0, œÄ], right? Because the smallest it can be is 0 when sin x = -1, which occurs at x = 3œÄ/2, but wait, 3œÄ/2 is more than œÄ, so within [0, œÄ], sin x is non-negative. Wait, sin x is non-negative on [0, œÄ], so 1 + sin x is always positive on [0, œÄ]. That means f(x) is strictly increasing on [0, œÄ].Since f(x) is even, it must be strictly decreasing on [-œÄ, 0]. So, in summary, f(x) increases from 0 to œÄ and decreases from -œÄ to 0.Okay, so now I know the function's behavior. Let's look at each condition one by one.Condition ‚ë†: x‚ÇÅ > |x‚ÇÇ|. So, x‚ÇÅ is greater than the absolute value of x‚ÇÇ. Since x‚ÇÅ is greater than |x‚ÇÇ|, and because f(x) is increasing on [0, œÄ], this should mean that f(x‚ÇÅ) > f(|x‚ÇÇ|). But since f is even, f(|x‚ÇÇ|) = f(x‚ÇÇ). So, f(x‚ÇÅ) > f(x‚ÇÇ). That seems to hold. So condition ‚ë† should always ensure f(x‚ÇÅ) > f(x‚ÇÇ).Condition ‚ë°: |x‚ÇÅ| > x‚ÇÇ. Hmm, this is a bit trickier. Let's think about what this means. If |x‚ÇÅ| > x‚ÇÇ, it could mean a few things. For example, if x‚ÇÇ is negative, then |x‚ÇÅ| is always greater than x‚ÇÇ because |x‚ÇÅ| is non-negative and x‚ÇÇ is negative. But if x‚ÇÇ is positive, then |x‚ÇÅ| > x‚ÇÇ implies that x‚ÇÅ is either greater than x‚ÇÇ or less than -x‚ÇÇ. But since we're dealing with f(x), which is even, f(x‚ÇÅ) depends on |x‚ÇÅ|.Wait, let's test with specific numbers. Suppose x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/6 and x‚ÇÇ = -œÄ/3. Then |x‚ÇÅ| = œÄ/6 and x‚ÇÇ = -œÄ/3. So |x‚ÇÅ| = œÄ/6 ‚âà 0.523, and x‚ÇÇ = -œÄ/3 ‚âà -1.047. So |x‚ÇÅ| > x‚ÇÇ because 0.523 > -1.047. But f(x‚ÇÅ) = |œÄ/6| - cos(œÄ/6) = œÄ/6 - (‚àö3)/2 ‚âà 0.523 - 0.866 ‚âà -0.343. f(x‚ÇÇ) = |-œÄ/3| - cos(-œÄ/3) = œÄ/3 - 0.5 ‚âà 1.047 - 0.5 ‚âà 0.547. So f(x‚ÇÅ) ‚âà -0.343 < f(x‚ÇÇ) ‚âà 0.547. So even though |x‚ÇÅ| > x‚ÇÇ, f(x‚ÇÅ) is not greater than f(x‚ÇÇ). So condition ‚ë° doesn't always hold.Condition ‚ë¢: x‚ÇÅ¬≤ > x‚ÇÇ¬≤. That means |x‚ÇÅ| > |x‚ÇÇ| because squaring removes the sign. So if |x‚ÇÅ| > |x‚ÇÇ|, then since f(x) is increasing on [0, œÄ], f(|x‚ÇÅ|) > f(|x‚ÇÇ|). But since f is even, f(x‚ÇÅ) = f(|x‚ÇÅ|) and f(x‚ÇÇ) = f(|x‚ÇÇ|). Therefore, f(x‚ÇÅ) > f(x‚ÇÇ). So condition ‚ë¢ should always hold.Condition ‚ë£: x‚ÇÅ¬≥ > x‚ÇÇ¬≥. Hmm, let's think about this. If x‚ÇÅ¬≥ > x‚ÇÇ¬≥, that implies x‚ÇÅ > x‚ÇÇ if both are positive, but if x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ have different signs, it's not so straightforward. For example, if x‚ÇÅ is positive and x‚ÇÇ is negative, x‚ÇÅ¬≥ will always be greater than x‚ÇÇ¬≥ because positive numbers cubed are positive and negative numbers cubed are negative. But does that guarantee f(x‚ÇÅ) > f(x‚ÇÇ)?Let me test with specific numbers again. Let‚Äôs take x‚ÇÅ = œÄ/6 ‚âà 0.523 and x‚ÇÇ = -œÄ/3 ‚âà -1.047. Then x‚ÇÅ¬≥ ‚âà 0.143 and x‚ÇÇ¬≥ ‚âà -1.147. So x‚ÇÅ¬≥ > x‚ÇÇ¬≥. Now, f(x‚ÇÅ) = |œÄ/6| - cos(œÄ/6) ‚âà 0.523 - 0.866 ‚âà -0.343. f(x‚ÇÇ) = |-œÄ/3| - cos(-œÄ/3) ‚âà 1.047 - 0.5 ‚âà 0.547. So f(x‚ÇÅ) ‚âà -0.343 < f(x‚ÇÇ) ‚âà 0.547. So even though x‚ÇÅ¬≥ > x‚ÇÇ¬≥, f(x‚ÇÅ) is not greater than f(x‚ÇÇ). Therefore, condition ‚ë£ doesn't always hold.So, summarizing:- Condition ‚ë† always holds.- Condition ‚ë° doesn't always hold.- Condition ‚ë¢ always holds.- Condition ‚ë£ doesn't always hold.Therefore, the conditions that always ensure f(x‚ÇÅ) > f(x‚ÇÇ) are ‚ë† and ‚ë¢."},{"question":"Sara grew 43 pumpkins, but the rabbits ate 23 pumpkins.

The functions in question are ( x^n ), ( x^+ = x vee 0 ), ( x^- = (-x) vee 0 ), and ( |x| = x^+ + x^- ). Additionally, I need to show a more general result: any continuous function ( f = f(x) ) where ( x in mathbb{R}^n ) and ( n geq 1 ) is a Borel function.First, let me recall what a Borel function is. A Borel function is a function between two topological spaces that is measurable with respect to the Borel (sigma)-algebra. In simpler terms, a function is Borel if the preimage of every Borel set is a Borel set. Since we're dealing with functions from ( mathbb{R}^n ) to ( mathbb{R} ), I need to ensure that for any Borel set ( B ) in ( mathbb{R} ), the set ( f^{-1}(B) ) is a Borel set in ( mathbb{R}^n ).Now, focusing on the specific functions:1. **Power Function ( x^n ):**   This function raises ( x ) to the power of ( n ). I know that polynomial functions are continuous everywhere on ( mathbb{R} ). Since continuous functions are Borel measurable, ( x^n ) should be a Borel function.2. **Positive Part ( x^+ = x vee 0 ):**   This function takes the maximum of ( x ) and 0. It's essentially a piecewise function:   [   x^+ =    begin{cases}   x & text{if } x geq 0,    0 & text{if } x < 0.   end{cases}   ]   This function is also continuous because it's made up of continuous pieces and is continuous at the point where the pieces meet (at ( x = 0 )).3. **Negative Part ( x^- = (-x) vee 0 ):**   Similar to the positive part, this function takes the maximum of ( -x ) and 0:   [   x^- =    begin{cases}   0 & text{if } x geq 0,    -x & text{if } x < 0.   end{cases}   ]   Again, this is a continuous function.4. **Absolute Value ( |x| = x^+ + x^- ):**   The absolute value function is continuous everywhere. It can also be expressed as:   [   |x| =    begin{cases}   x & text{if } x geq 0,    -x & text{if } x < 0.   end{cases}   ]   Since it's continuous, it should be a Borel function.Now, moving on to the general result: any continuous function ( f: mathbb{R}^n to mathbb{R} ) is a Borel function. To prove this, I'll need to use the definition of continuity in terms of open sets and the fact that the preimage of an open set under a continuous function is open.Given that ( f ) is continuous, for any open set ( U ) in ( mathbb{R} ), the preimage ( f^{-1}(U) ) is open in ( mathbb{R}^n ). Since the Borel (sigma)-algebra is generated by open sets, the preimage of any Borel set under ( f ) will be a Borel set in ( mathbb{R}^n ). Therefore, ( f ) is Borel measurable.Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The key point is that the preimage of any open set is open, and since Borel sets are generated by open sets, the preimage of any Borel set is Borel. That makes sense.But, to be thorough, I should consider whether there are any edge cases or specific properties of ( mathbb{R}^n ) that might affect this. For example, in higher dimensions, continuity still implies that the preimage of open sets is open, so the argument should hold.Also, thinking about the specific functions mentioned earlier, since they are all continuous, they must be Borel functions as a special case of this general result.I think I've covered the main points. To summarize:- Each of the specific functions ( x^n ), ( x^+ ), ( x^- ), and ( |x| ) is continuous.- Continuous functions have the property that the preimage of any open set is open.- Since Borel sets are generated by open sets, the preimage of any Borel set under a continuous function is Borel.- Therefore, any continuous function ( f: mathbb{R}^n to mathbb{R} ) is a Borel function.I don't see any gaps in this reasoning, but maybe I should double-check the definitions to ensure I'm applying them correctly.**Definitions to Verify:**- **Borel Function:** A function ( f: X to Y ) between two topological spaces is Borel measurable if the preimage of every Borel set in ( Y ) is a Borel set in ( X ).  - **Continuous Function:** A function ( f: X to Y ) is continuous if the preimage of every open set in ( Y ) is open in ( X ).Given these definitions, since continuous functions preserve open sets, and Borel sets are built from open sets, it follows that continuous functions preserve Borel sets. Hence, continuous functions are Borel measurable.Yes, that seems solid. I think I'm confident with this approach."},{"question":"Prove that the sum of the distances from an arbitrary point X to the vertices of a regular n-gon will be minimal if X is the center of the n-gon.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem: I need to prove that the sum of the distances from an arbitrary point X to the vertices of a regular n-gon is minimal when X is the center of the n-gon. Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me visualize a regular n-gon. It's a polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. So, it's symmetric in all directions. The center of the n-gon is equidistant from all the vertices, right? That distance is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the n-gon.Now, the problem is about finding a point X such that the sum of the distances from X to each vertex is as small as possible. Intuitively, since the center is equidistant from all vertices, it seems like a good candidate for minimizing this sum. But I need to prove it rigorously.Let me denote the center as O. So, if X is O, then each distance from O to a vertex is just the radius, say r. Therefore, the sum of distances would be n times r, which is straightforward.But what if X is not at the center? Let's say X is somewhere else inside or outside the n-gon. Then, the distances from X to each vertex would vary. Some distances might be shorter, and some might be longer. The question is, does the sum of these distances ever get smaller than n times r?Maybe I can use some geometric properties or inequalities to compare the sum when X is at O versus when it's somewhere else. I recall that in optimization problems involving distances, the concept of the centroid or geometric median often comes into play. The centroid minimizes the sum of squared distances, but here we're dealing with the sum of linear distances.Wait, in the case of a regular polygon, due to its symmetry, the center should also be the centroid. So, perhaps the center minimizes the sum of linear distances as well. But I need to confirm this.Let me think about the properties of regular polygons. Each vertex can be represented in the complex plane as points on a circle with center at the origin. Maybe I can model this problem in the complex plane to make it easier.Suppose the regular n-gon is inscribed in a unit circle centered at the origin. Then, the vertices can be represented as the nth roots of unity: ( A_k = e^{2pi i k/n} ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 ).Let X be a point in the complex plane, say ( X = x ). The distance from X to each vertex ( A_k ) is ( |x - A_k| ). So, the sum of distances is ( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |x - A_k| ).I need to show that this sum is minimized when ( x = 0 ), which is the center.Hmm, how can I approach this? Maybe I can use some inequality or optimization technique.I remember that for real numbers, the sum of absolute deviations is minimized at the median. But in the complex plane, it's more complicated. However, due to the symmetry of the regular polygon, maybe the center still serves as the point that minimizes the sum.Alternatively, perhaps I can use vector analysis. Let me consider the vectors from X to each vertex. The sum of these vectors might have some properties that can help me.Wait, if X is not at the center, then the vectors from X to each vertex won't all have the same magnitude. But due to the symmetry, maybe their vector sum has some relationship with the position of X.Actually, if I consider the sum of the vectors from the center O to each vertex, that sum is zero because of the symmetry. Each vector is canceled out by its opposite. So, ( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} overrightarrow{OA_k} = 0 ).But how does that relate to the sum of distances from X to each vertex?Maybe I can express the distance from X to each vertex in terms of vectors. Let me denote ( overrightarrow{OX} = mathbf{x} ). Then, the vector from X to ( A_k ) is ( overrightarrow{A_kX} = overrightarrow{OA_k} - overrightarrow{OX} = mathbf{a_k} - mathbf{x} ).So, the distance from X to ( A_k ) is ( |mathbf{a_k} - mathbf{x}| ). Therefore, the sum of distances is ( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |mathbf{a_k} - mathbf{x}| ).I need to minimize this sum with respect to ( mathbf{x} ).This seems like a problem of minimizing the sum of Euclidean norms, which is a known problem in optimization. In general, the solution to such a problem is the geometric median of the points ( mathbf{a_k} ).But in this case, due to the symmetry of the regular polygon, the geometric median should coincide with the center O. Because all the points ( mathbf{a_k} ) are symmetrically distributed around O, any other point would break this symmetry and likely result in a larger sum of distances.Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of convexity. The function ( f(mathbf{x}) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |mathbf{a_k} - mathbf{x}| ) is a convex function, and its minimum occurs at the point where its subgradient includes zero.But I'm not sure about the specifics of calculating the subgradient here. Maybe there's a simpler way.Wait, let's consider the case when n is even versus when n is odd. For even n, the regular polygon has opposite vertices, and for odd n, it doesn't. But in both cases, the center is still the point of symmetry.Perhaps I can use the triangle inequality. For each vertex ( A_k ), the distance from X to ( A_k ) is at least the distance from O to ( A_k ) minus the distance from O to X. But that might not directly help.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of distances is minimized when X is the Fermat-Torricelli point of the set of vertices. But for a regular polygon, the Fermat-Torricelli point coincides with the center due to symmetry.Wait, actually, the Fermat-Torricelli point minimizes the sum of distances to a set of given points. In the case of a regular polygon, because of its high symmetry, the center is the only point that treats all vertices equally, so it should be the Fermat-Torricelli point.But I need to make this more precise. Maybe I can argue by contradiction. Suppose that there exists a point X ‚â† O such that the sum of distances from X to the vertices is less than the sum from O to the vertices.But due to the rotational symmetry of the regular polygon, if X is not at O, I can rotate the polygon such that X is moved to a different position, but the sum of distances should remain the same. However, since the polygon is regular, this rotation would not change the sum, implying that the sum is the same for all points at the same distance from O. But this seems like it's not necessarily leading me to a contradiction.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of potential energy. If I think of each vertex as a point mass, then the sum of distances can be thought of as the potential energy at point X. The potential energy is minimized when X is at the center of mass, which, due to symmetry, is O.But again, this is more of an intuitive argument rather than a rigorous proof.Perhaps I can use calculus. Let's consider the function ( f(mathbf{x}) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |mathbf{a_k} - mathbf{x}| ). To find its minimum, I can take the derivative with respect to ( mathbf{x} ) and set it to zero.But the derivative of the absolute value function is not differentiable at zero, so I need to be careful. However, in higher dimensions, the subgradient of the norm function can be used.The subgradient of ( |mathbf{a_k} - mathbf{x}| ) at ( mathbf{x} ) is ( frac{mathbf{x} - mathbf{a_k}}{|mathbf{x} - mathbf{a_k}|} ) if ( mathbf{x} neq mathbf{a_k} ). So, the subgradient of the sum is ( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{mathbf{x} - mathbf{a_k}}{|mathbf{x} - mathbf{a_k}|} ).At the minimum, this subgradient should be zero. So, we have:( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{mathbf{x} - mathbf{a_k}}{|mathbf{x} - mathbf{a_k}|} = 0 ).Now, if ( mathbf{x} = mathbf{0} ) (the center), does this equation hold?Let's check. Each ( mathbf{a_k} ) is a point on the unit circle, so ( |mathbf{a_k}| = 1 ). Then, ( frac{mathbf{0} - mathbf{a_k}}{|mathbf{0} - mathbf{a_k}|} = -mathbf{a_k} ).So, the sum becomes ( -sum_{k=0}^{n-1} mathbf{a_k} ).But earlier, I noted that ( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} mathbf{a_k} = 0 ) due to symmetry. Therefore, the sum is zero, which satisfies the condition for the minimum.Therefore, the center O is indeed a critical point for the sum of distances function.But is it the only critical point? Suppose there is another point X ‚â† O where the sum of the unit vectors ( frac{mathbf{x} - mathbf{a_k}}{|mathbf{x} - mathbf{a_k}|} ) cancels out. Due to the symmetry, it's unlikely because any deviation from O would break the symmetry, and the vectors would not cancel out.Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of convexity again. Since the sum of convex functions is convex, and the function is strictly convex except at points where the gradient is not defined, the minimum should be unique.Given that O is a critical point and the function is convex, O must be the unique minimizer.Therefore, the sum of distances from any point X to the vertices of a regular n-gon is minimized when X is the center of the n-gon.I think this makes sense. The key points are the symmetry of the regular polygon, the properties of the sum of vectors from the center, and the use of calculus to find the critical point which coincides with the center."},{"question":"The decimal representation of the natural number ( a ) consists of ( n ) identical digits ( x ), the number ( b ) consists of ( n ) identical digits ( y ), and the number ( c ) consists of ( 2n ) identical digits ( z ). For any ( n geq 2 ), find all such digits ( x, y, z ) for which ( a^2 + b = c ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find digits x, y, z such that when I create numbers a, b, and c with n identical digits each, the equation a¬≤ + b = c holds true for any n ‚â• 2. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand what a, b, and c look like. If a has n identical digits x, then a is essentially a number like xxx...x with n digits. Similarly, b is yyy...y with n digits, and c is zzz...z with 2n digits. So, for example, if n=2, x=3, then a would be 33, b would be something like 22 if y=2, and c would be 1111 if z=1.Now, I need to express these numbers mathematically. I remember that a number with all identical digits can be written using a formula. For example, a number with n digits all x can be written as x times (10^n - 1)/9. Let me verify that: if x=3 and n=2, then 3*(10^2 -1)/9 = 3*(99)/9 = 3*11 = 33. Yes, that works. Similarly, for c, which has 2n digits, it would be z*(10^{2n} -1)/9.So, writing this out:a = x * (10^n - 1)/9b = y * (10^n - 1)/9c = z * (10^{2n} - 1)/9Now, the equation given is a¬≤ + b = c. Substituting the expressions for a, b, and c:[x * (10^n - 1)/9]^2 + [y * (10^n - 1)/9] = [z * (10^{2n} - 1)/9]Let me simplify this equation step by step. First, expand the square term:x¬≤ * [(10^n - 1)/9]^2 + y * (10^n - 1)/9 = z * (10^{2n} - 1)/9To make this easier, let me multiply both sides by 81 to eliminate the denominators:x¬≤ * (10^n - 1)^2 + 9y * (10^n - 1) = 9z * (10^{2n} - 1)Now, let's expand (10^n - 1)^2:(10^n - 1)^2 = 10^{2n} - 2*10^n + 1So, substituting back in:x¬≤ * (10^{2n} - 2*10^n + 1) + 9y * (10^n - 1) = 9z * (10^{2n} - 1)Let me distribute x¬≤ and 9y:x¬≤*10^{2n} - 2x¬≤*10^n + x¬≤ + 9y*10^n - 9y = 9z*10^{2n} - 9zNow, let's collect like terms. I'll bring all terms to one side:x¬≤*10^{2n} - 2x¬≤*10^n + x¬≤ + 9y*10^n - 9y - 9z*10^{2n} + 9z = 0Factor out 10^{2n}, 10^n, and constants:( x¬≤ - 9z ) * 10^{2n} + ( -2x¬≤ + 9y ) * 10^n + ( x¬≤ - 9y + 9z ) = 0This equation must hold true for any n ‚â• 2. Since 10^{2n} and 10^n are powers of 10, the coefficients of these terms must each be zero for the equation to hold for all n. Otherwise, the equation would not balance for different values of n.So, setting each coefficient to zero:1. Coefficient of 10^{2n}: x¬≤ - 9z = 0 => x¬≤ = 9z => z = x¬≤ / 92. Coefficient of 10^n: -2x¬≤ + 9y = 0 => 9y = 2x¬≤ => y = (2x¬≤)/93. Constant term: x¬≤ - 9y + 9z = 0But since we already have expressions for y and z in terms of x, let's substitute them into the constant term equation:x¬≤ - 9*(2x¬≤/9) + 9*(x¬≤/9) = 0Simplify each term:x¬≤ - 2x¬≤ + x¬≤ = 0Which simplifies to 0 = 0. So, the constant term doesn't give us any new information, which makes sense because we've already used the other two equations to express y and z in terms of x.Now, since x, y, z are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9. Also, z must be a digit, so x¬≤ must be divisible by 9, meaning x must be a multiple of 3. Similarly, y must be an integer, so 2x¬≤ must be divisible by 9, which implies that x¬≤ must be divisible by 9/ gcd(2,9) = 9, since gcd(2,9)=1. So, x must be a multiple of 3.Therefore, possible values for x are 0, 3, 6, 9. But since a is a natural number with n digits, x cannot be 0 (as that would make a a number with leading zeros, which isn't allowed). So, x can be 3, 6, or 9.Let's consider each case:1. x = 3:Then, z = x¬≤ / 9 = 9 / 9 = 1y = (2x¬≤)/9 = (2*9)/9 = 2So, x=3, y=2, z=1Let me check if this works for n=2:a = 33, b=22, c=1111Compute a¬≤ + b: 33¬≤ = 1089, 1089 + 22 = 1111, which is c. So, it works for n=2.Let me check for n=3:a = 333, b=222, c=111111Compute a¬≤: 333¬≤ = 110889Add b: 110889 + 222 = 111111, which is c. So, it works for n=3 as well.Good, so this solution works for any n.2. x = 6:Then, z = x¬≤ / 9 = 36 / 9 = 4y = (2x¬≤)/9 = (2*36)/9 = 72/9 = 8So, x=6, y=8, z=4Check for n=2:a=66, b=88, c=4444Compute a¬≤: 66¬≤ = 4356Add b: 4356 + 88 = 4444, which is c. So, works for n=2.Check for n=3:a=666, b=888, c=444444Compute a¬≤: 666¬≤ = 443556Add b: 443556 + 888 = 444444, which is c. So, works for n=3.Good, this solution also works for any n.3. x = 9:Then, z = x¬≤ / 9 = 81 / 9 = 9y = (2x¬≤)/9 = (2*81)/9 = 162/9 = 18But y must be a single digit, so y=18 is invalid. Therefore, x=9 is not a valid solution.So, the only valid solutions are x=3, y=2, z=1 and x=6, y=8, z=4.Wait, but the problem says \\"for any n ‚â• 2\\". I've checked for n=2 and n=3, but do these solutions hold for all n?Let me think about it. The way we derived the equations was by setting the coefficients of 10^{2n}, 10^n, and the constant term to zero, which must hold for all n. Therefore, as long as x, y, z satisfy those equations, the equality a¬≤ + b = c will hold for any n.Thus, the solutions x=3, y=2, z=1 and x=6, y=8, z=4 are valid for any n ‚â• 2.Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \\"for any n ‚â• 2\\", so we need to make sure that these solutions work for all n, not just specific n. Since we've derived the conditions based on the coefficients being zero for all n, these solutions should indeed work for any n.Therefore, the possible digits are:Either x=3, y=2, z=1 or x=6, y=8, z=4.Let me just double-check if there are any other possible x values. We considered x=3,6,9. x=9 didn't work because y became two digits. What about x=0? Well, x=0 would make a=0, which is a natural number, but b would also be 0, and c would be 0. But 0¬≤ + 0 = 0, which is true, but the problem specifies \\"natural number a\\", which typically starts from 1, so x=0 might not be considered. Also, c would have 2n digits, all z=0, but leading zeros are not allowed in numbers, so z=0 would make c=0, which is a single digit, not 2n digits. So, x=0 is invalid.Therefore, the only valid solutions are x=3, y=2, z=1 and x=6, y=8, z=4.Wait, but in the initial problem, it says \\"for any n ‚â• 2\\", so we need to make sure that these solutions work for all n, not just specific n. Since we've derived the conditions based on the coefficients being zero for all n, these solutions should indeed work for any n.Yes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is that the possible digits are either x=3, y=2, z=1 or x=6, y=8, z=4."},{"question":"Mr. Blue measures his rectangular garden and finds it measures 18 steps by 25 steps.

To do this, I'll calculate the altitude of the triangle using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.

A certain fresh corn processing company can process 260,000 ears of fresh corn per year before the technological improvement. After the technological improvement, the average daily processing quantity is 1.3 times the original quantity. If the time to process 260,000 ears of fresh corn after the improvement is 25 days less than before, find how many ears of fresh corn the company can process per day before the technological improvement.","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem about a fresh corn processing company. They used to process 260,000 ears of corn per year before they improved their technology. After the improvement, they can process 1.3 times more corn each day. The problem also says that after the improvement, it takes them 25 fewer days to process the same amount of corn. I need to find out how many ears of corn they could process per day before the technological improvement.Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what the company's daily processing capacity was before the improvement. Let's call that number \\"x\\". So, before the improvement, they processed x ears of corn each day. After the improvement, they can process 1.3 times more, which would be 1.3x ears per day.Now, they process 260,000 ears of corn per year. I need to find out how many days it took them to process that amount before and after the improvement. Before the improvement, the number of days would be the total ears divided by the daily processing capacity, so that's 260,000 divided by x. After the improvement, it would be 260,000 divided by 1.3x.The problem states that the time after the improvement is 25 days less than before. So, the number of days before minus the number of days after equals 25. That gives me the equation:260,000 / x - 260,000 / (1.3x) = 25Hmm, that looks like a good equation to work with. Let me write that down:260,000/x - 260,000/(1.3x) = 25Okay, now I need to solve for x. Let's see. First, I can factor out 260,000/x from both terms:260,000/x * (1 - 1/1.3) = 25Wait, is that right? Let me check. If I factor out 260,000/x, then the first term is 260,000/x * 1, and the second term is 260,000/x * (1/1.3). So, yes, that seems correct.So, 260,000/x * (1 - 1/1.3) = 25Now, let's compute 1 - 1/1.3. 1/1.3 is approximately 0.7692. So, 1 - 0.7692 is about 0.2308.So, 260,000/x * 0.2308 = 25Now, I can write this as:260,000 * 0.2308 / x = 25Let me compute 260,000 * 0.2308. Let's see, 260,000 * 0.2 is 52,000, and 260,000 * 0.0308 is approximately 260,000 * 0.03 = 7,800, and 260,000 * 0.0008 = 208. So, adding those together: 52,000 + 7,800 = 59,800, plus 208 is 60,008.So, approximately, 60,008 / x = 25Therefore, x = 60,008 / 25Calculating that, 60,008 divided by 25 is 2,400.32Hmm, that's approximately 2,400 ears per day. Since we're dealing with whole ears of corn, it makes sense to round this to 2,400 ears per day.Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the equation:260,000/x - 260,000/(1.3x) = 25I factored out 260,000/x, which gave me:260,000/x * (1 - 1/1.3) = 25Then, I calculated 1 - 1/1.3 as approximately 0.2308, which seems right because 1/1.3 is roughly 0.7692.Multiplying 260,000 by 0.2308 gave me approximately 60,008, and dividing that by 25 gave me x ‚âà 2,400.32, which I rounded to 2,400.To verify, let's plug x = 2,400 back into the original equation:260,000 / 2,400 = 108.333... daysAfter the improvement, the daily processing is 1.3 * 2,400 = 3,120 ears per day.So, 260,000 / 3,120 ‚âà 83.333... daysNow, subtracting the two times: 108.333... - 83.333... = 25 daysYes, that checks out perfectly.

I need to figure out in which quadrant(s) Œ± lies. The options are A) First or third quadrant, B) First or second quadrant, C) Second or fourth quadrant, and D) Third or fourth quadrant.Alright, let's start by understanding what this equation represents. The angle Œ± is being defined as some multiple of 180 degrees plus 45 degrees. Since k is an integer, it can be any whole number, positive or negative, including zero. So, essentially, Œ± can be 45¬∞, 225¬∞, 405¬∞, and so on, depending on the value of k.I remember that in the unit circle, angles are measured from the positive x-axis, and they can be in one of four quadrants: first, second, third, or fourth. The first quadrant is from 0¬∞ to 90¬∞, the second from 90¬∞ to 180¬∞, the third from 180¬∞ to 270¬∞, and the fourth from 270¬∞ to 360¬∞. Angles beyond 360¬∞ just wrap around the circle again.So, if I plug in different integer values for k, I can see where Œ± lands. Let's try a few examples.First, let's take k = 0. Then Œ± = 0¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 45¬∞. That's in the first quadrant because it's between 0¬∞ and 90¬∞. Okay, so that's one case.Next, let's try k = 1. Then Œ± = 1¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 225¬∞. Hmm, 225¬∞ is in the third quadrant because it's between 180¬∞ and 270¬∞. So, with k = 1, Œ± is in the third quadrant.What about k = 2? Then Œ± = 2¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 360¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 405¬∞. But 405¬∞ is more than 360¬∞, so I can subtract 360¬∞ to find the equivalent angle. 405¬∞ - 360¬∞ = 45¬∞, which is back in the first quadrant. So, k = 2 brings us back to the first quadrant.Let's try a negative k. How about k = -1? Then Œ± = -1¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = -135¬∞. Negative angles mean we're rotating clockwise from the positive x-axis. So, -135¬∞ is the same as 360¬∞ - 135¬∞ = 225¬∞, which is in the third quadrant. So, k = -1 also gives us the third quadrant.What if k = -2? Then Œ± = -2¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = -360¬∞ + 45¬∞ = -315¬∞. Again, negative angle, so adding 360¬∞ gives us 45¬∞, which is in the first quadrant. So, k = -2 brings us back to the first quadrant.From these examples, it seems like when k is even (like 0, 2, -2), Œ± is in the first quadrant, and when k is odd (like 1, -1), Œ± is in the third quadrant. So, depending on whether k is even or odd, Œ± alternates between the first and third quadrants.Let me think about why that is. The term k¬∑180¬∞ means that we're rotating by multiples of 180¬∞, which flips the direction of the angle each time. Adding 45¬∞ to that means that depending on whether we've flipped an even or odd number of times, we'll end up in either the first or third quadrant.If k is even, say k = 2n where n is an integer, then Œ± = 2n¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞. Since 2n¬∑180¬∞ is a multiple of 360¬∞, it's like rotating full circles, which brings us back to the starting point. So, Œ± = 45¬∞, which is in the first quadrant.If k is odd, say k = 2n + 1, then Œ± = (2n + 1)¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 2n¬∑180¬∞ + 180¬∞ + 45¬∞. Again, 2n¬∑180¬∞ is a multiple of 360¬∞, so it's like rotating full circles, and then we have 180¬∞ + 45¬∞, which is 225¬∞, in the third quadrant.So, it seems consistent that Œ± is in the first quadrant when k is even and in the third quadrant when k is odd. Therefore, Œ± can lie in either the first or the third quadrant, depending on the value of k.Looking back at the options, A) is \\"First or third quadrant,\\" which matches our conclusion. The other options don't fit because they mention quadrants that Œ± doesn't reach. For example, B) mentions the second quadrant, which Œ± never gets to because adding 45¬∞ to multiples of 180¬∞ only lands us in the first or third. Similarly, C) and D) include quadrants that aren't reached by this equation.Just to double-check, let's consider another value for k. Let's take k = 3. Then Œ± = 3¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 540¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 585¬∞. Subtracting 360¬∞ gives 225¬∞, which is in the third quadrant. If k = 4, Œ± = 4¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 720¬∞ + 45¬∞ = 765¬∞. Subtracting 720¬∞ (which is 2¬∑360¬∞) gives 45¬∞, first quadrant. Yep, still alternating between first and third.What about k = -3? Œ± = -3¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = -540¬∞ + 45¬∞ = -495¬∞. Adding 720¬∞ (which is 2¬∑360¬∞) gives 225¬∞, third quadrant. And k = -4, Œ± = -4¬∑180¬∞ + 45¬∞ = -720¬∞ + 45¬∞ = -675¬∞. Adding 720¬∞ gives 45¬∞, first quadrant.

Then he increased each number by 1 and noticed that the product of all 100 numbers did not change. He increased each number by 1 again, and again the product of all the numbers did not change, and so on. Grisha repeated this procedure k times, and each of the k times the product of the numbers did not change. Find the largest possible value of k.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where Grisha writes 100 numbers on a board. Then, he increases each number by 1, and the product of all these numbers doesn't change. He does this again and again, and each time the product remains the same. The question is asking for the largest possible value of k, meaning how many times he can do this before the product might change.Okay, let me try to break this down. First, let's denote the initial numbers as a1, a2, ..., a100. When Grisha increases each number by 1, the new numbers become a1 + 1, a2 + 1, ..., a100 + 1. The product of these new numbers is equal to the product of the original numbers. So, mathematically, we can write this as:(a1)(a2)...(a100) = (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)...(a100 + 1)Now, Grisha repeats this process k times, so after k increments, each number becomes ai + k, and the product remains the same each time. So, for each increment from 1 to k, the product doesn't change.Hmm, so we're looking for the maximum k such that for all i from 1 to k, the product of (ai + i) is equal to the original product.I think this relates to polynomials. If we consider the product as a polynomial in terms of x, where x is the increment, then we have:P(x) = (a1 + x)(a2 + x)...(a100 + x)We know that P(0) = P(1) = P(2) = ... = P(k). So, the polynomial P(x) takes the same value at k+1 distinct points: x = 0, 1, 2, ..., k.Now, a polynomial of degree n can take the same value at most n+1 times unless it's a constant polynomial. But in our case, P(x) is a polynomial of degree 100 because it's the product of 100 linear terms. So, if P(x) is not constant, it can take the same value at most 100 times. But since we're starting from x=0, the maximum number of times it can take the same value is 100, meaning k+1 <= 100, so k <= 99.Wait, but is k=99 achievable? Let me think about an example. Suppose all the numbers are such that when you add 1 each time, one of them becomes zero, making the product zero each time. For instance, if the numbers are -99, -98, ..., 0. Then, when you add 1, you get -98, -97, ..., 1, and the product is zero because one of them is still zero. Similarly, adding 1 again, you get -97, -96, ..., 2, and again, the product is zero because one of them is zero. This continues until you add 99, making all numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 99, but wait, no, actually, when you add 99, the numbers become 0, 1, 2, ..., 99, so the product is 99!, which is not zero. Hmm, that's a problem.Wait, no, actually, if the numbers are -99, -98, ..., 0, then adding 1 each time, the numbers become -98, -97, ..., 1. So, the product is zero because one of them is zero. Similarly, adding 1 again, you get -97, -96, ..., 2, and again, the product is zero because one of them is zero. This continues until you add 99, making the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 99. But in this case, the product is 99!, which is not zero. So, actually, the product changes at k=99. So, maybe k=99 is not achievable.Wait, but the problem says that Grisha repeated this procedure k times, and each of the k times the product did not change. So, if at k=99, the product changes, then k=99 is not allowed. So, maybe the maximum k is 99, but in this case, the product changes at k=99, so maybe the maximum k is 98.Wait, no, let me think again. If the numbers are -99, -98, ..., 0, then after adding 1, the numbers are -98, -97, ..., 1, and the product is zero. After adding 2, the numbers are -97, -96, ..., 2, and the product is zero. This continues until adding 99, making the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 99, and the product is 99!. So, the product was zero for k=1 to k=99, and then at k=100, it becomes 100!. But wait, Grisha only repeated the procedure k times, so if k=99, then the product was zero for all k=1 to 99, and then at k=100, it changes. But the problem says he repeated the procedure k times, and each time the product did not change. So, if k=99, then the product was zero for all 99 times, and then at k=100, it changes. So, k=99 is possible because the product didn't change during the first 99 increments.Wait, but in this case, the product was zero for all k=1 to 99, so it didn't change. So, k=99 is achievable. So, maybe the maximum k is 99.But wait, let me think again. If the numbers are -99, -98, ..., 0, then after adding 1, the numbers are -98, -97, ..., 1, and the product is zero. After adding 2, the numbers are -97, -96, ..., 2, and the product is zero. This continues until adding 99, making the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 99, and the product is 99!. So, the product was zero for k=1 to 99, and then at k=100, it becomes 100!. So, the product didn't change during the first 99 increments, so k=99 is possible.But wait, is there a way to make k larger than 99? If we set the numbers such that the product remains the same for more increments, but given that the polynomial can only take the same value at 100 points, and since we're starting from x=0, the maximum k is 99.So, I think the answer is 99."},{"question":"The parabola y=x^{2}-2x-3 and the coordinate axes intersect at points that lie on the same circle. The equation of the circle determined by these intersection points is („ÄÄ„ÄÄ).A: x^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=2B: (x-1)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=4C: (x-1)^{2}+y^{2}=4D: (x-1)^{2}+(y+1)^{2}=5","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a parabola and a circle. The parabola is given by the equation y = x¬≤ - 2x - 3, and it intersects the coordinate axes at certain points. These intersection points lie on the same circle, and I need to find the equation of that circle from the given options.First, I should probably sketch the parabola to get a better idea. The equation is y = x¬≤ - 2x - 3. I know that the general form of a parabola is y = ax¬≤ + bx + c, so in this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -3. Since a is positive, the parabola opens upwards.To find where it intersects the coordinate axes, I need to find the x-intercepts and the y-intercept.For the x-intercepts, I set y = 0 and solve for x:0 = x¬≤ - 2x - 3This is a quadratic equation, so I can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to -2. Hmm, that would be -3 and +1 because (-3) * 1 = -3 and (-3) + 1 = -2. So, the equation factors as:0 = (x - 3)(x + 1)Therefore, the x-intercepts are at x = 3 and x = -1. So the points are (3, 0) and (-1, 0).For the y-intercept, I set x = 0 and solve for y:y = (0)¬≤ - 2*(0) - 3 = -3So the y-intercept is at (0, -3).So, the parabola intersects the coordinate axes at three points: (-1, 0), (3, 0), and (0, -3). These three points lie on the same circle, and I need to find the equation of that circle.I remember that three non-collinear points determine a unique circle. So, with these three points, I can find the equation of the circle passing through them.The general equation of a circle is (x - h)¬≤ + (y - k)¬≤ = r¬≤, where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.Since the parabola is symmetric about its vertex, which is at x = 1 (since the vertex x-coordinate is -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) = 1), maybe the center of the circle also lies on this line of symmetry. So, perhaps the center is at (1, k) for some k.If that's the case, then the center is (1, k), and the circle passes through (-1, 0), (3, 0), and (0, -3). So, I can plug these points into the circle equation to find h, k, and r.But since I assumed h = 1, I can write the equation as (x - 1)¬≤ + (y - k)¬≤ = r¬≤.Now, plug in the points:1. For (-1, 0):(-1 - 1)¬≤ + (0 - k)¬≤ = r¬≤(-2)¬≤ + (-k)¬≤ = r¬≤4 + k¬≤ = r¬≤ --- Equation 12. For (3, 0):(3 - 1)¬≤ + (0 - k)¬≤ = r¬≤(2)¬≤ + (-k)¬≤ = r¬≤4 + k¬≤ = r¬≤ --- Equation 2Wait, both equations 1 and 2 give the same result, which is 4 + k¬≤ = r¬≤. That doesn't help me find k because both equations are identical. So, I need to use the third point to get another equation.3. For (0, -3):(0 - 1)¬≤ + (-3 - k)¬≤ = r¬≤(-1)¬≤ + (-3 - k)¬≤ = r¬≤1 + ( -3 - k )¬≤ = r¬≤ --- Equation 3Now, from Equation 1, we have r¬≤ = 4 + k¬≤. So, substitute this into Equation 3:1 + (-3 - k)¬≤ = 4 + k¬≤Let me expand (-3 - k)¬≤:(-3 - k)¬≤ = (-3)¬≤ + 2*(-3)*(-k) + (-k)¬≤ = 9 + 6k + k¬≤So, substituting back into Equation 3:1 + 9 + 6k + k¬≤ = 4 + k¬≤Simplify the left side:10 + 6k + k¬≤ = 4 + k¬≤Subtract 4 + k¬≤ from both sides:10 + 6k + k¬≤ - 4 - k¬≤ = 0Simplify:6 + 6k = 0Divide both sides by 6:1 + k = 0So, k = -1Now that I have k = -1, I can find r¬≤ from Equation 1:r¬≤ = 4 + (-1)¬≤ = 4 + 1 = 5So, the equation of the circle is:(x - 1)¬≤ + (y - (-1))¬≤ = 5Simplify:(x - 1)¬≤ + (y + 1)¬≤ = 5Looking at the options, that's option D: (x - 1)¬≤ + (y + 1)¬≤ = 5.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the three points: (-1, 0), (3, 0), and (0, -3). I assumed the center is (1, k) because of the symmetry of the parabola. Then, I plugged in the points into the circle equation.For (-1, 0):(-1 - 1)¬≤ + (0 - k)¬≤ = r¬≤(-2)¬≤ + k¬≤ = r¬≤4 + k¬≤ = r¬≤For (3, 0):(3 - 1)¬≤ + (0 - k)¬≤ = r¬≤(2)¬≤ + k¬≤ = r¬≤4 + k¬≤ = r¬≤Same result, so that's consistent.For (0, -3):(0 - 1)¬≤ + (-3 - k)¬≤ = r¬≤1 + ( -3 - k )¬≤ = r¬≤Then, substituting r¬≤ = 4 + k¬≤:1 + ( -3 - k )¬≤ = 4 + k¬≤Expanding (-3 - k)¬≤:9 + 6k + k¬≤So, 1 + 9 + 6k + k¬≤ = 4 + k¬≤10 + 6k + k¬≤ = 4 + k¬≤Subtract 4 + k¬≤:6 + 6k = 06k = -6k = -1So, k = -1, which gives r¬≤ = 5. So, the equation is (x - 1)¬≤ + (y + 1)¬≤ = 5, which is option D.I think that's correct. Let me just visualize the points on the circle.Center at (1, -1). The radius is sqrt(5), which is approximately 2.236.Distance from center (1, -1) to (-1, 0):sqrt[ (1 - (-1))¬≤ + (-1 - 0)¬≤ ] = sqrt[ (2)¬≤ + (-1)¬≤ ] = sqrt[4 + 1] = sqrt(5). Correct.Distance to (3, 0):sqrt[ (1 - 3)¬≤ + (-1 - 0)¬≤ ] = sqrt[ (-2)¬≤ + (-1)¬≤ ] = sqrt[4 + 1] = sqrt(5). Correct.Distance to (0, -3):sqrt[ (1 - 0)¬≤ + (-1 - (-3))¬≤ ] = sqrt[1 + (2)¬≤] = sqrt[1 + 4] = sqrt(5). Correct.So, all three points are indeed on the circle with center (1, -1) and radius sqrt(5). Therefore, the equation is (x - 1)¬≤ + (y + 1)¬≤ = 5, which is option D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"If a gt c, b gt c, then which of the following is true?A: ab gt c^{2}B: ab lt c^{2}C: a+b gt 2cD: a+b lt 2c","answer":"Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is true given that ( a > c ) and ( b > c ). The options are:A: ( ab > c^2 )B: ( ab < c^2 )C: ( a + b > 2c )D: ( a + b < 2c )Okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what each option is saying based on the given inequalities.Starting with options A and B, they both deal with the product of ( a ) and ( b ) compared to ( c^2 ). So, if ( a > c ) and ( b > c ), does that necessarily mean that ( ab ) is greater than ( c^2 ), or could it be less? Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I can test some numbers to see.Let's pick some simple numbers where ( a > c ) and ( b > c ). Let's say ( c = 2 ), then ( a ) and ( b ) have to be greater than 2. Let's choose ( a = 3 ) and ( b = 4 ). Then:( ab = 3 times 4 = 12 )( c^2 = 2^2 = 4 )So in this case, ( ab = 12 ) is definitely greater than ( c^2 = 4 ). So option A seems to hold here.But wait, what if ( c ) is negative? Let's try that. Suppose ( c = -1 ), then ( a ) and ( b ) just need to be greater than -1. Let's pick ( a = 0 ) and ( b = 0 ). Then:( ab = 0 times 0 = 0 )( c^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 )Here, ( ab = 0 ) is less than ( c^2 = 1 ). So in this case, option B would be true. But that contradicts our previous result where option A was true. So, does that mean both A and B can be true depending on the values of ( a ), ( b ), and ( c )? That doesn't seem right because the question is asking which statement is true given the conditions, implying only one of them should be correct.Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the problem assumes that ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are positive numbers? The problem doesn't specify, so I can't assume that. Hmm, this is confusing.Let's move on to options C and D, which involve the sum of ( a ) and ( b ) compared to ( 2c ). Given that ( a > c ) and ( b > c ), if I add these two inequalities together, I get:( a + b > c + c )Which simplifies to:( a + b > 2c )So, that seems to directly support option C. Let me test this with some numbers to make sure.Using the same numbers as before, ( a = 3 ), ( b = 4 ), ( c = 2 ):( a + b = 7 )( 2c = 4 )So, ( 7 > 4 ), which is true.What about negative numbers? Let's try ( a = 0 ), ( b = 0 ), ( c = -1 ):( a + b = 0 )( 2c = -2 )So, ( 0 > -2 ), which is also true.Another example: ( a = 5 ), ( b = 6 ), ( c = 3 ):( a + b = 11 )( 2c = 6 )( 11 > 6 ), which holds.And one more with negative ( c ): ( a = -0.5 ), ( b = -0.5 ), ( c = -1 ):( a + b = -1 )( 2c = -2 )( -1 > -2 ), which is true.Okay, so it seems that no matter what values I choose (as long as ( a > c ) and ( b > c )), option C always holds. That makes sense because when you add two inequalities, the direction of the inequality remains the same.Going back to options A and B, since they can be both true or false depending on the values, they aren't necessarily always true. Therefore, the only statement that must be true given the conditions is option C.So, after all this thinking and testing, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is option C: ( a + b > 2c )."},{"question":"An arrangement is defined as any way to seat n couples at a round table with 2n places. A couple is said to be together if the two members are seated next to each other. What is the average number of couples that are together per arrangement?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the average number of couples that are seated together at a round table with 2n seats, where there are n couples. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that when dealing with arrangements around a round table, the number of ways to arrange k people is (k-1)! because rotations are considered the same. So, for 2n people, the total number of arrangements is (2n - 1)!.Now, I need to find the average number of couples sitting together. To do this, I can use the concept of linearity of expectation. Instead of trying to count all possible arrangements and how many couples are together in each, I can consider each couple individually and find the probability that they are sitting together. Then, sum these probabilities to get the expected number.Let me define an indicator random variable X_i for each couple i, where X_i = 1 if the couple is sitting together and X_i = 0 otherwise. Then, the expected number of couples sitting together is E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_n] due to linearity of expectation.So, I just need to find E[X_i] for one couple and then multiply it by n.How do I find E[X_i]? Well, E[X_i] is the probability that couple i is sitting together. Let's fix couple i. How many ways can they sit together?In a round table, the number of ways to seat couple i together is 2 * (2n - 2)! because we can treat the couple as a single entity, which can be arranged in 2 ways (since they can switch places), and then arrange the remaining 2n - 2 people. But wait, since it's a round table, the total number of arrangements is (2n - 1)!.Wait, no, actually, if we fix couple i together, we can consider them as a single \\"block.\\" So, we have (2n - 1) entities to arrange around the table, which would be (2n - 2)! ways. But since the couple can switch places, we multiply by 2, giving 2 * (2n - 2)!.But the total number of arrangements is (2n - 1)! So, the probability that couple i is sitting together is [2 * (2n - 2)!] / (2n - 1)!.Simplifying that, (2n - 1)! = (2n - 1) * (2n - 2)! So, the probability becomes 2 / (2n - 1).Therefore, E[X_i] = 2 / (2n - 1) for each couple i.Since there are n couples, the expected number of couples sitting together is n * (2 / (2n - 1)) = 2n / (2n - 1).Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.Alternatively, I can think about fixing one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's fix person A's seat. Then, person A's partner can be seated in any of the remaining 2n - 1 seats. The number of seats adjacent to person A is 2 (one on the left and one on the right). So, the probability that person A's partner is sitting next to them is 2 / (2n - 1).Since this is true for each couple, and there are n couples, the expected number is n * (2 / (2n - 1)) = 2n / (2n - 1).Yes, that seems consistent. So, the average number of couples sitting together is 2n divided by (2n - 1).I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 2n over (2n - 1).**Final Answer**The average number of couples that are together per arrangement is boxed{dfrac{2n}{2n - 1}}."},{"question":"The product of the third and sixth terms of an arithmetic sequence is 406. When the ninth term of this sequence is divided by the fourth term, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 6. Find the first term and the common difference of the sequence.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The product of the third and sixth terms is 406, and when the ninth term is divided by the fourth term, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 6. I need to find the first term and the common difference.Alright, let's start by recalling what an arithmetic sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if the first term is ( a_1 ) and the common difference is ( d ), then the nth term is ( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d ).Given that, let's write down the expressions for the terms mentioned in the problem.The third term (( a_3 )) is ( a_1 + 2d ).The sixth term (( a_6 )) is ( a_1 + 5d ).Their product is 406, so:( (a_1 + 2d)(a_1 + 5d) = 406 ).Let me expand this:( a_1^2 + 5a_1d + 2a_1d + 10d^2 = 406 )Simplify:( a_1^2 + 7a_1d + 10d^2 = 406 ).Okay, that's one equation.Now, the other condition is about the ninth term divided by the fourth term. The ninth term is ( a_1 + 8d ), and the fourth term is ( a_1 + 3d ). When we divide the ninth term by the fourth term, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 6.Hmm, division with quotient and remainder. So, in algebraic terms, that means:( a_9 = 2 times a_4 + 6 ).Substituting the expressions:( a_1 + 8d = 2(a_1 + 3d) + 6 ).Let me expand the right side:( a_1 + 8d = 2a_1 + 6d + 6 ).Now, let's bring all terms to one side:( a_1 + 8d - 2a_1 - 6d = 6 )Simplify:( -a_1 + 2d = 6 )So, ( -a_1 + 2d = 6 ) or ( a_1 = 2d - 6 ).Alright, so now I have an expression for ( a_1 ) in terms of ( d ). Let me substitute this into the first equation I had.From earlier:( a_1^2 + 7a_1d + 10d^2 = 406 ).Substituting ( a_1 = 2d - 6 ):( (2d - 6)^2 + 7(2d - 6)d + 10d^2 = 406 ).Let me compute each term step by step.First, ( (2d - 6)^2 ):( (2d)^2 - 2 times 2d times 6 + 6^2 = 4d^2 - 24d + 36 ).Next, ( 7(2d - 6)d ):First, multiply ( (2d - 6)d = 2d^2 - 6d ).Then multiply by 7: ( 14d^2 - 42d ).So, putting it all together:( 4d^2 - 24d + 36 + 14d^2 - 42d + 10d^2 = 406 ).Combine like terms:( (4d^2 + 14d^2 + 10d^2) + (-24d - 42d) + 36 = 406 ).Calculating each:- ( 4d^2 + 14d^2 + 10d^2 = 28d^2 )- ( -24d - 42d = -66d )- Constant term: 36So, the equation becomes:( 28d^2 - 66d + 36 = 406 ).Subtract 406 from both sides to set the equation to zero:( 28d^2 - 66d + 36 - 406 = 0 )Simplify:( 28d^2 - 66d - 370 = 0 ).Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of ( d ). Let me write it as:( 28d^2 - 66d - 370 = 0 ).To solve for ( d ), I can use the quadratic formula:( d = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ),where ( a = 28 ), ( b = -66 ), and ( c = -370 ).Let me compute the discriminant first:( D = b^2 - 4ac = (-66)^2 - 4 times 28 times (-370) ).Calculate each part:( (-66)^2 = 4356 ).( 4 times 28 = 112 ).( 112 times (-370) = -41440 ).But since it's ( -4ac ), it becomes:( -4 times 28 times (-370) = 41440 ).So, discriminant ( D = 4356 + 41440 = 45896 ).Now, square root of 45896. Let me see:I know that ( 200^2 = 40000 ), so sqrt(45896) is a bit more than 200.Let me compute ( 214^2 = 45796 ), which is close.Wait, 214^2 = (200 + 14)^2 = 200^2 + 2*200*14 + 14^2 = 40000 + 5600 + 196 = 45796.Hmm, 45796 is less than 45896. The difference is 45896 - 45796 = 100.So, sqrt(45896) is 214 + 100/(2*214) approximately, but maybe it's a whole number.Wait, 214^2 = 45796, 215^2 = 46225, which is higher than 45896.So, sqrt(45896) is not a whole number. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.Let me check:( D = (-66)^2 - 4*28*(-370) = 4356 + 4*28*370 ).Compute 4*28 = 112.112*370: Let's compute 100*370 = 37000, 12*370 = 4440, so total is 37000 + 4440 = 41440.So, D = 4356 + 41440 = 45896.Yes, that's correct.So, sqrt(45896) is approximately 214.23, but since it's not a perfect square, the solutions will be fractions.So, ( d = frac{66 pm sqrt{45896}}{56} ).Wait, sqrt(45896) is approximately 214.23, so:( d = frac{66 pm 214.23}{56} ).Calculating both possibilities:First, ( d = frac{66 + 214.23}{56} = frac{280.23}{56} approx 5.004 ).Second, ( d = frac{66 - 214.23}{56} = frac{-148.23}{56} approx -2.647 ).Hmm, so ( d ) is approximately 5.004 or approximately -2.647.But since we're dealing with an arithmetic sequence, the common difference can be positive or negative. However, let's see if these approximate values make sense.Wait, but maybe I should compute the exact value of sqrt(45896). Let me see:45896 divided by 4 is 11474, which is still not a perfect square. Divided by 4 again, 11474 / 4 = 2868.5, which isn't an integer. So, it's not a perfect square. So, the solutions will indeed be irrational.But let's see if I can simplify sqrt(45896). Let's factor 45896:Divide by 4: 45896 = 4 * 11474.11474 divided by 2 is 5737.5737 is a prime number? Let me check: 5737 divided by 13 is 441.3, not integer. Divided by 7: 5737 / 7 ‚âà 819.57, not integer. Maybe 5737 is prime. So, sqrt(45896) = 2*sqrt(11474) = 2*sqrt(2*5737). So, it doesn't simplify further.Therefore, the solutions are:( d = frac{66 pm 2sqrt{11474}}{56} ).Simplify numerator and denominator:Divide numerator and denominator by 2:( d = frac{33 pm sqrt{11474}}{28} ).Hmm, that's not very helpful. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.Wait, let me double-check the equations.We had:( a_1 = 2d - 6 ).Then substituted into ( a_1^2 + 7a_1d + 10d^2 = 406 ).Let me recompute that substitution step.( (2d - 6)^2 + 7*(2d - 6)*d + 10d^2 ).First, ( (2d - 6)^2 = 4d^2 - 24d + 36 ).Second, ( 7*(2d - 6)*d = 7*(2d^2 - 6d) = 14d^2 - 42d ).Third, ( 10d^2 ).So, adding them up:4d^2 -24d +36 +14d^2 -42d +10d^2.Combine like terms:4d^2 +14d^2 +10d^2 = 28d^2.-24d -42d = -66d.+36.So, 28d^2 -66d +36 = 406.Yes, that's correct.Then, 28d^2 -66d +36 -406 = 0 => 28d^2 -66d -370 = 0.Yes, correct.So, no mistake there.So, the quadratic equation is correct, and the solutions are as above.But since the problem is likely expecting integer solutions, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the division condition.Wait, let me go back to the division part.The ninth term divided by the fourth term gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 6.So, in division terms, that means:( a_9 = 2*a_4 + 6 ).Is that correct?Yes, because when you divide a number by another, you get quotient and remainder such that:Dividend = Divisor * Quotient + Remainder.So, ( a_9 = a_4 * 2 + 6 ).Yes, that's correct.So, ( a_1 + 8d = 2*(a_1 + 3d) + 6 ).Which simplifies to ( a_1 + 8d = 2a_1 + 6d + 6 ).Then, ( -a_1 + 2d = 6 ), so ( a_1 = 2d -6 ).That's correct.So, perhaps the solutions are not integers, but fractions.Wait, let me compute the exact values.We have:( d = frac{66 pm sqrt{45896}}{56} ).But sqrt(45896) is sqrt(4*11474) = 2*sqrt(11474). So,( d = frac{66 pm 2sqrt{11474}}{56} = frac{33 pm sqrt{11474}}{28} ).Hmm, that's still messy.Wait, maybe I can factor 11474.Let me try dividing 11474 by small primes:11474 √∑ 2 = 5737.5737 √∑ 7 = 819.571... Not integer.5737 √∑ 11 = 521.545... Not integer.5737 √∑ 13 = 441.307... Not integer.5737 √∑ 17 = 337.47... Not integer.5737 √∑ 19 = 302.947... Not integer.5737 √∑ 23 = 249.434... Not integer.5737 √∑ 29 = 197.827... Not integer.5737 √∑ 31 = 185.064... Not integer.5737 √∑ 37 = 155.054... Not integer.Hmm, seems like 5737 is a prime number. So, sqrt(11474) = sqrt(2*5737), which doesn't simplify.Therefore, the solutions for ( d ) are irrational. That seems odd because the problem might expect integer solutions.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.Let me double-check.Product of third and sixth terms: ( (a_1 + 2d)(a_1 + 5d) = 406 ).Division condition: ( a_9 = 2*a_4 + 6 ).So, ( a_1 + 8d = 2*(a_1 + 3d) + 6 ).Which simplifies to ( a_1 + 8d = 2a_1 + 6d + 6 ).Thus, ( -a_1 + 2d = 6 ), so ( a_1 = 2d -6 ).Yes, that's correct.So, substituting into the product equation:( (2d -6 + 2d)(2d -6 +5d) = 406 ).Wait, hold on. Wait, no, the third term is ( a_1 + 2d ), which is ( (2d -6) + 2d = 4d -6 ).Similarly, the sixth term is ( a_1 +5d = (2d -6) +5d =7d -6 ).So, their product is ( (4d -6)(7d -6) = 406 ).Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in substitution. I substituted ( a_1 = 2d -6 ) into ( a_1^2 +7a_1d +10d^2 ), but actually, the product is ( (a_1 +2d)(a_1 +5d) ), which is ( (4d -6)(7d -6) ).Wait, let me recast this.If ( a_1 = 2d -6 ), then:Third term: ( a_1 +2d = (2d -6) +2d =4d -6 ).Sixth term: ( a_1 +5d = (2d -6) +5d =7d -6 ).So, their product is ( (4d -6)(7d -6) = 406 ).Let me compute this:( (4d -6)(7d -6) = 28d^2 -24d -42d +36 =28d^2 -66d +36 ).Set equal to 406:( 28d^2 -66d +36 =406 ).So, (28d^2 -66d +36 -406=0 ).Which is (28d^2 -66d -370=0).Wait, that's the same equation as before. So, no mistake there.So, the solutions are indeed ( d = frac{33 pm sqrt{11474}}{28} ).Hmm, that's approximately 5.004 and -2.647.But let me check if these approximate values satisfy the original conditions.First, take ( d approx 5.004 ).Then, ( a_1 =2d -6 approx 2*5.004 -6 =10.008 -6=4.008 ).So, approximately, ( a_1 approx4.008 ), ( d approx5.004 ).Let's compute the third term: ( a_1 +2d approx4.008 +10.008=14.016 ).Sixth term: ( a_1 +5d approx4.008 +25.02=29.028 ).Product: (14.016 *29.028 approx406. So, that works.Now, check the division condition.Ninth term: ( a_1 +8d approx4.008 +40.032=44.04 ).Fourth term: ( a_1 +3d approx4.008 +15.012=19.02 ).Divide 44.04 by19.02: 44.04 /19.02‚âà2.315.But the problem says the quotient is 2 and remainder 6.Wait, that doesn't match. Because 2*19.02=38.04, and 44.04 -38.04=6. So, actually, it does satisfy the condition.Because 44.04 =2*19.02 +6.Yes, so it's correct.Similarly, for the negative ( d approx-2.647 ).Compute ( a_1 =2d -6 approx2*(-2.647) -6‚âà-5.294 -6‚âà-11.294 ).Third term: ( a_1 +2d‚âà-11.294 +2*(-2.647)‚âà-11.294 -5.294‚âà-16.588 ).Sixth term: ( a_1 +5d‚âà-11.294 +5*(-2.647)‚âà-11.294 -13.235‚âà-24.529 ).Product: (-16.588)*(-24.529)‚âà406. So, that works.Now, check the division condition.Ninth term: ( a_1 +8d‚âà-11.294 +8*(-2.647)‚âà-11.294 -21.176‚âà-32.47 ).Fourth term: ( a_1 +3d‚âà-11.294 +3*(-2.647)‚âà-11.294 -7.941‚âà-19.235 ).Divide -32.47 by -19.235: Approximately 1.69.But the problem says the quotient is 2 and remainder 6.Wait, let's compute 2*(-19.235) +6‚âà-38.47 +6‚âà-32.47.Yes, so it does satisfy the condition because -32.47 =2*(-19.235) +6.So, both solutions are valid.But the problem asks for the first term and the common difference. It doesn't specify whether they should be integers or not. So, both solutions are correct.But in the initial problem statement, it's an arithmetic sequence, which can have any real numbers as terms, not necessarily integers.However, in the original problem, the user wrote:\\"The product of the third and sixth terms of an arithmetic sequence is 406. When the ninth term of this sequence is divided by the fourth term, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 6. Find the first term and the common difference of the sequence.\\"So, they didn't specify whether the terms are integers or not. So, both solutions are valid.But let me see if I can express the exact values.We have:( d = frac{33 pm sqrt{11474}}{28} ).But sqrt(11474) is irrational, so we can't simplify it further.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as:( d = frac{33}{28} pm frac{sqrt{11474}}{28} ).But that's still not very helpful.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.Wait, let me think again.We have:( a_9 = 2*a_4 +6 ).Which is ( a_1 +8d = 2*(a_1 +3d) +6 ).So, ( a_1 +8d = 2a_1 +6d +6 ).Thus, ( -a_1 +2d =6 ), so ( a_1 =2d -6 ).Yes, that's correct.So, substituting into the product:( (a_1 +2d)(a_1 +5d) =406 ).Which is ( (4d -6)(7d -6)=406 ).Which leads to (28d^2 -66d +36=406), so (28d^2 -66d -370=0).Yes, correct.So, the solutions are indeed as above.Therefore, the first term is ( a_1 =2d -6 ), where ( d = frac{33 pm sqrt{11474}}{28} ).So, the exact solutions are:( a_1 =2*left(frac{33 pm sqrt{11474}}{28}right) -6 = frac{66 pm 2sqrt{11474}}{28} -6 = frac{33 pm sqrt{11474}}{14} -6 ).Convert 6 to fourteenths: 6 = 84/14.So,( a_1 = frac{33 pm sqrt{11474} -84}{14} = frac{-51 pm sqrt{11474}}{14} ).So, the first term is ( frac{-51 pm sqrt{11474}}{14} ).But that's still messy.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the solutions as fractions.Wait, let me compute the approximate values again.For ( d approx5.004 ), ( a_1 approx4.008 ).For ( d approx-2.647 ), ( a_1 approx-11.294 ).But maybe the problem expects integer solutions, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the division condition.Wait, let me think again about the division.When the ninth term is divided by the fourth term, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 6.In algebraic terms, that means:( a_9 = 2*a_4 +6 ).But another way to write division with remainder is:( a_9 = q*a_4 + r ), where ( 0 leq r < |a_4| ).But in this case, the remainder is 6, so ( a_4 ) must be greater than 6 in absolute value.But in the case where ( d ) is negative, ( a_4 ) could be negative, so the remainder would have the same sign as the divisor.Wait, in division, the remainder has the same sign as the divisor.So, if ( a_4 ) is negative, the remainder would be negative, but the problem says the remainder is 6, which is positive.Therefore, ( a_4 ) must be positive, so the remainder is positive.Therefore, ( a_4 >0 ).Thus, ( a_1 +3d >0 ).So, in the case where ( d ) is negative, ( a_1 +3d >0 ).Given that ( a_1 =2d -6 ), so ( 2d -6 +3d >0 ).Which is (5d -6 >0 ).So, (5d >6 ), so ( d >6/5=1.2 ).But in the case where ( d ) is negative, ( d >1.2 ) is not possible.Therefore, the solution with negative ( d ) is invalid because it would make ( a_4 ) negative, which would result in a negative remainder, but the problem states the remainder is 6, positive.Therefore, only the positive ( d ) solution is valid.Thus, ( d approx5.004 ), and ( a_1 approx4.008 ).But since the problem likely expects exact values, let me see if I can express ( d ) as a fraction.Wait, 28d^2 -66d -370=0.Let me try to factor this quadratic equation.Looking for two numbers that multiply to 28*(-370)= -10360 and add to -66.Hmm, that's a bit tricky.Alternatively, perhaps I can divide the equation by 2:14d^2 -33d -185=0.Still not easy to factor.Alternatively, use the quadratic formula:( d = frac{33 pm sqrt{(-33)^2 -4*14*(-185)}}{2*14} ).Compute discriminant:( 1089 + 4*14*185 ).Compute 4*14=56, 56*185.Compute 56*185:56*100=5600, 56*80=4480, 56*5=280.So, 5600+4480=10080, +280=10360.Thus, discriminant=1089+10360=11449.Wait, 11449 is a perfect square?Let me check: 107^2=11449.Yes, because 100^2=10000, 107^2=11449.Yes, because 107*107=11449.So, sqrt(11449)=107.Therefore, ( d = frac{33 pm107}{28} ).So, two solutions:1. ( d = frac{33 +107}{28} = frac{140}{28}=5 ).2. ( d = frac{33 -107}{28} = frac{-74}{28} = -frac{37}{14} ).Ah! So, I must have made a mistake earlier in computing the discriminant.Wait, initially, I had:Quadratic equation:28d^2 -66d -370=0.But when I divided by 2, I got14d^2 -33d -185=0.Then, discriminant= (-33)^2 -4*14*(-185)=1089 +10360=11449=107^2.Therefore, ( d = frac{33 pm107}{28} ).So, ( d=5 ) or ( d= -frac{37}{14} ).Wait, so earlier, I must have miscalculated the discriminant.Wait, initially, I had:Quadratic equation:28d^2 -66d -370=0.So, a=28, b=-66, c=-370.Discriminant D= b^2 -4ac= (-66)^2 -4*28*(-370)=4356 +41440=45896.But 45896 is not 11449.Wait, but when I divided the equation by 2, I got14d^2 -33d -185=0.So, a=14, b=-33, c=-185.Then, discriminant= (-33)^2 -4*14*(-185)=1089 +10360=11449=107^2.So, that's correct.Therefore, the solutions are:( d = frac{33 pm107}{28} ).So, ( d= frac{140}{28}=5 ) or ( d= frac{-74}{28}= -frac{37}{14} ).Ah, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I didn't divide the equation by 2, leading to an incorrect discriminant.Therefore, the correct solutions are ( d=5 ) and ( d= -frac{37}{14} ).But earlier, we saw that ( d= -frac{37}{14} ) leads to ( a_4 ) being negative, which would result in a negative remainder, contradicting the problem's statement of a remainder of 6.Therefore, only ( d=5 ) is valid.Thus, ( d=5 ).Then, ( a_1=2d -6=2*5 -6=10 -6=4 ).Therefore, the first term is 4, and the common difference is5.Let me verify:Third term: ( a_1 +2d=4 +10=14 ).Sixth term: ( a_1 +5d=4 +25=29 ).Product:14*29=406. Correct.Ninth term: ( a_1 +8d=4 +40=44 ).Fourth term: ( a_1 +3d=4 +15=19 ).Divide 44 by19: 19*2=38, remainder 6. Correct.Yes, that works.Therefore, the first term is4, and the common difference is5."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=|x+ sqrt {a}|-|x- sqrt {1-a}|.(I) When a=1, find the solution set of the inequality f(x)geqslant dfrac {1}{2}.(II) If for any ain[0,1], the solution set of the inequality f(x)geqslant b is empty, find the range of the real number b.","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) = |x + sqrt(a)| - |x - sqrt(1 - a)|. There are two parts to the problem. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with part (I): When a = 1, find the solution set of the inequality f(x) ‚â• 1/2.Okay, so if a = 1, then sqrt(a) is sqrt(1) which is 1. Similarly, sqrt(1 - a) would be sqrt(0), which is 0. So substituting these into the function, f(x) becomes |x + 1| - |x - 0|, which simplifies to |x + 1| - |x|.So the inequality is |x + 1| - |x| ‚â• 1/2.Hmm, I need to solve this inequality. Let me think about how to approach this. The expression |x + 1| - |x| is the difference of two absolute values. I remember that absolute value functions can be broken down into different cases based on the value of x.Let me consider the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change their behavior. For |x + 1|, the critical point is at x = -1. For |x|, the critical point is at x = 0. So, I should break down the real line into intervals based on these critical points: (-‚àû, -1), [-1, 0), and [0, ‚àû).Let me analyze each interval separately.1. **Case 1: x < -1**In this interval, x + 1 is negative because x is less than -1. So |x + 1| = -(x + 1) = -x - 1.Similarly, x is negative, so |x| = -x.Therefore, f(x) = (-x - 1) - (-x) = (-x - 1) + x = -1.So f(x) = -1 in this interval. The inequality f(x) ‚â• 1/2 becomes -1 ‚â• 1/2, which is false. So there are no solutions in this interval.2. **Case 2: -1 ‚â§ x < 0**In this interval, x + 1 is non-negative because x is greater than or equal to -1. So |x + 1| = x + 1.But x is still negative, so |x| = -x.Therefore, f(x) = (x + 1) - (-x) = x + 1 + x = 2x + 1.So f(x) = 2x + 1 in this interval. The inequality becomes 2x + 1 ‚â• 1/2.Let me solve this:2x + 1 ‚â• 1/2  Subtract 1 from both sides: 2x ‚â• -1/2  Divide both sides by 2: x ‚â• -1/4.But in this interval, x is between -1 and 0. So x must satisfy both x ‚â• -1/4 and -1 ‚â§ x < 0. Therefore, the solution in this interval is -1/4 ‚â§ x < 0.3. **Case 3: x ‚â• 0**In this interval, x + 1 is positive, so |x + 1| = x + 1.Also, x is non-negative, so |x| = x.Therefore, f(x) = (x + 1) - x = 1.So f(x) = 1 in this interval. The inequality f(x) ‚â• 1/2 becomes 1 ‚â• 1/2, which is true. So all x in this interval satisfy the inequality.Putting it all together, the solutions are:- From Case 2: -1/4 ‚â§ x < 0- From Case 3: x ‚â• 0Combining these, the solution set is x ‚â• -1/4.Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the solution set was given as {x | x ‚â• -0.25}, which is the same as x ‚â• -1/4. So that seems consistent.But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.In Case 1: x < -1, f(x) = -1, which is less than 1/2. Correct.In Case 2: -1 ‚â§ x < 0, f(x) = 2x + 1. Solving 2x + 1 ‚â• 1/2 gives x ‚â• -1/4. Since x is between -1 and 0, the solution is -1/4 ‚â§ x < 0. Correct.In Case 3: x ‚â• 0, f(x) = 1, which is always greater than 1/2. Correct.So overall, the solution set is x ‚â• -1/4, which is the same as x ‚â• -0.25.Alright, that seems solid.Moving on to part (II): If for any a ‚àà [0,1], the solution set of the inequality f(x) ‚â• b is empty, find the range of the real number b.Hmm, so for any a in [0,1], the inequality f(x) ‚â• b has no solution. That means f(x) < b for all x and for all a ‚àà [0,1]. Therefore, b must be greater than the maximum value that f(x) can take for any a in [0,1].So I need to find the maximum value of f(x) over all x and a ‚àà [0,1], and then b must be greater than this maximum.Wait, but the problem says \\"for any a ‚àà [0,1], the solution set of the inequality f(x) ‚â• b is empty.\\" So for each a, f(x) < b for all x. Therefore, b must be greater than the supremum of f(x) over x for each a, and since this has to hold for all a, b must be greater than the maximum of these suprema over a.So essentially, I need to find the maximum of f(x) over x and a ‚àà [0,1], and then b must be greater than this maximum.Alternatively, since for each a, the maximum of f(x) is some value, and then b must be greater than the maximum of these maxima over a ‚àà [0,1].So first, let's analyze f(x) for a general a ‚àà [0,1].f(x) = |x + sqrt(a)| - |x - sqrt(1 - a)|.I need to find the maximum of this function over x for a fixed a.I remember that the maximum of |x + c| - |x - d| occurs at the point where the derivative changes sign, but since this is a piecewise linear function, the maximum occurs either at the point where the two absolute values balance or at infinity.Wait, actually, let me consider the behavior of f(x).As x approaches infinity, |x + sqrt(a)| - |x - sqrt(1 - a)| approaches (x + sqrt(a)) - (x - sqrt(1 - a)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a).Similarly, as x approaches negative infinity, |x + sqrt(a)| - |x - sqrt(1 - a)| approaches (-x - sqrt(a)) - (-x + sqrt(1 - a)) = -sqrt(a) - sqrt(1 - a).So the function f(x) tends to sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a) as x approaches infinity and tends to -sqrt(a) - sqrt(1 - a) as x approaches negative infinity.Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a), and the minimum is -sqrt(a) - sqrt(1 - a).But since we are looking for f(x) ‚â• b to have no solution, we need b to be greater than the maximum of f(x), which is sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a).Therefore, for each a, the maximum of f(x) is sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a). So to ensure that f(x) < b for all x and all a ‚àà [0,1], b must be greater than the maximum of sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a) over a ‚àà [0,1].So now, I need to find the maximum of the function g(a) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a) for a ‚àà [0,1].Let me analyze this function.g(a) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a).To find its maximum, I can take the derivative with respect to a and set it to zero.Compute g'(a):g'(a) = (1/(2*sqrt(a))) - (1/(2*sqrt(1 - a))).Set g'(a) = 0:(1/(2*sqrt(a))) - (1/(2*sqrt(1 - a))) = 0  => 1/(2*sqrt(a)) = 1/(2*sqrt(1 - a))  => sqrt(1 - a) = sqrt(a)  => 1 - a = a  => 1 = 2a  => a = 1/2.So the critical point is at a = 1/2.Now, let's check the value of g(a) at a = 1/2:g(1/2) = sqrt(1/2) + sqrt(1 - 1/2) = sqrt(1/2) + sqrt(1/2) = 2*(sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2).Now, let's check the endpoints:At a = 0: g(0) = sqrt(0) + sqrt(1 - 0) = 0 + 1 = 1.At a = 1: g(1) = sqrt(1) + sqrt(1 - 1) = 1 + 0 = 1.So the maximum of g(a) is sqrt(2) at a = 1/2.Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) over all x and a ‚àà [0,1] is sqrt(2).Hence, to ensure that f(x) < b for all x and all a ‚àà [0,1], b must be greater than sqrt(2).Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"for any a ‚àà [0,1], the solution set of the inequality f(x) ‚â• b is empty.\\" So for each a, f(x) < b for all x. Therefore, b must be greater than the maximum of f(x) for each a.But since the maximum of f(x) over x is sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a), and the maximum of this over a is sqrt(2), then b must be greater than sqrt(2).Therefore, the range of b is b > sqrt(2).Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the answer given was b > sqrt(1 - a) + sqrt(a). But that seems to be for a specific a, not considering the maximum over a.But in part (II), it's for any a ‚àà [0,1], so we need to take the maximum over a as well.So the correct range for b is b > sqrt(2).Wait, but let me double-check.If b is greater than sqrt(2), then for any a, since the maximum of f(x) is sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a) ‚â§ sqrt(2), then f(x) < b for all x and a.Yes, that makes sense.Therefore, the range of b is b > sqrt(2).But in the initial problem, the answer given was b > sqrt(1 - a) + sqrt(a), which is correct for a specific a, but since we need it for all a, we need to take the maximum over a, which is sqrt(2).So the correct answer for part (II) is b > sqrt(2).Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem.The problem says: \\"If for any a ‚àà [0,1], the solution set of the inequality f(x) ‚â• b is empty, find the range of the real number b.\\"So for each a, the inequality f(x) ‚â• b has no solution. That means for each a, f(x) < b for all x. Therefore, b must be greater than the supremum of f(x) over x for each a. Since this has to hold for all a, b must be greater than the supremum of f(x) over x and a.But f(x) for a given a has a supremum of sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 - a). So the supremum over a is sqrt(2). Therefore, b must be greater than sqrt(2).Yes, that seems correct.So to summarize:(I) When a = 1, the solution set is x ‚â• -1/4.(II) The range of b is b > sqrt(2).I think that's it."},{"question":"Determine all functions from (mathbb{R}) to (mathbb{R}) that satisfy:forall(x, y) in mathbb{R}^{2}, f(x) f(y) + f(x+y) = x y","answer":"Okay, so I have this functional equation to solve: for all real numbers x and y, f(x)f(y) + f(x+y) equals xy. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that a good starting point for functional equations is to plug in specific values for x or y to see if I can get some useful information. Maybe I can set one of the variables to zero because that often simplifies things.Let me set y = 0. Then the equation becomes f(x)f(0) + f(x+0) = x*0. Simplifying that, it's f(x)f(0) + f(x) = 0. So, factoring out f(x), I get f(x)(f(0) + 1) = 0. Hmm, so this equation tells me that for every x, either f(x) is zero or f(0) + 1 is zero. If f(0) + 1 is not zero, then f(x) must be zero for all x. That would be one possible solution: f(x) = 0 for all x. Let me check if that works in the original equation. If f(x) is zero everywhere, then f(x)f(y) is zero, and f(x+y) is also zero, so the left side is zero. The right side is xy, which isn't necessarily zero. Wait, that doesn't work unless x or y is zero. So, actually, f(x) = 0 isn't a solution except when x or y is zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, no, if f(x) is zero for all x, then f(x)f(y) + f(x+y) is 0 + 0 = 0, but the right side is xy, which isn't zero for all x and y. So that can't be a solution. Therefore, f(0) + 1 must be zero, meaning f(0) = -1. Okay, so that tells me that f(0) is -1.Now, knowing that f(0) = -1, maybe I can find more information. Let me try setting y = -x. Then the equation becomes f(x)f(-x) + f(0) = x*(-x). Since f(0) is -1, this simplifies to f(x)f(-x) - 1 = -x¬≤. Therefore, f(x)f(-x) = 1 - x¬≤.Interesting, so the product of f(x) and f(-x) is 1 - x squared. Maybe this can help me later.Let me see if I can find f(1). Maybe setting x = 1 and y = 1. Then the equation becomes f(1)f(1) + f(2) = 1*1 = 1. So, f(1)¬≤ + f(2) = 1. Hmm, but I don't know f(2) yet. Maybe I can find another equation involving f(2).Alternatively, maybe I can assume a form for f(x). Since the right side is xy, which is a bilinear term, maybe f(x) is linear. Let me suppose that f(x) is a linear function, say f(x) = ax + b. Let's see if that works.Plugging into the equation: (a x + b)(a y + b) + a(x + y) + b = x y.Expanding the left side: a¬≤ x y + a b x + a b y + b¬≤ + a x + a y + b.Grouping like terms: a¬≤ x y + (a b + a) x + (a b + a) y + (b¬≤ + b).This should equal x y for all x and y, so the coefficients of corresponding terms must be equal.So, for the x y term: a¬≤ = 1.For the x term: a b + a = 0.Similarly, for the y term: a b + a = 0.For the constant term: b¬≤ + b = 0.Let me solve these equations.From a¬≤ = 1, we have a = 1 or a = -1.From a b + a = 0, factoring out a: a(b + 1) = 0. Since a is either 1 or -1, which are non-zero, we must have b + 1 = 0, so b = -1.From the constant term: b¬≤ + b = (-1)¬≤ + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0, which holds.So, with a = 1 and b = -1, we get f(x) = x - 1.Similarly, with a = -1 and b = -1, we get f(x) = -x - 1.So, these are two possible solutions: f(x) = x - 1 and f(x) = -x - 1.Wait, earlier I thought f(x) = 0 was a solution, but that didn't work. So, maybe the only solutions are f(x) = x - 1 and f(x) = -x - 1.But let me check these solutions in the original equation to make sure.First, f(x) = x - 1.Compute f(x)f(y) + f(x+y):(x - 1)(y - 1) + (x + y - 1) = xy - x - y + 1 + x + y - 1 = xy. Yes, that works.Now, f(x) = -x - 1.Compute f(x)f(y) + f(x+y):(-x - 1)(-y - 1) + (-x - y - 1) = (xy + x + y + 1) + (-x - y - 1) = xy. That also works.So, both of these functions satisfy the equation.But earlier, when I set y = 0, I thought f(x) = 0 might be a solution, but it didn't work. So, the only solutions are f(x) = x - 1 and f(x) = -x - 1.Wait, but what about the case when f(0) = -1? I think I covered that by assuming a linear function. Is there a possibility of a non-linear solution?Hmm, let me think. Suppose f is not linear. Maybe quadratic? Let me try f(x) = ax¬≤ + bx + c.But plugging that into the equation would result in a more complicated expression, and I suspect it won't satisfy the equation for all x and y. Let me test it quickly.Suppose f(x) = ax¬≤ + bx + c.Then f(x)f(y) = (ax¬≤ + bx + c)(ay¬≤ + by + c).That's a quartic term, which would be a¬≤x¬≤y¬≤, which is not present on the right side, which is linear in x and y. So, unless a = 0, which would make f linear, we can't have a quadratic solution. So, f must be linear.Therefore, the only solutions are f(x) = x - 1 and f(x) = -x - 1.Wait, but earlier I thought f(x) = 0 was a solution, but it didn't work. So, maybe f(x) = 0 is not a solution. Let me double-check.If f(x) = 0 for all x, then f(x)f(y) + f(x+y) = 0 + 0 = 0, but the right side is xy, which is not zero unless x or y is zero. So, f(x) = 0 is not a solution.Therefore, the only solutions are f(x) = x - 1 and f(x) = -x - 1.Wait, but in the beginning, when I set y = 0, I got f(x)(f(0) + 1) = 0. So, either f(x) = 0 for all x, or f(0) = -1.But f(x) = 0 is not a solution, so f(0) must be -1, and f is linear, leading to the two solutions above.So, in conclusion, the functions that satisfy the equation are f(x) = x - 1 and f(x) = -x - 1."},{"question":"Mr. Wang has 45 candies, and he decides to eat some each day. Because these candies are very tasty, from the second day onward, the number of candies he eats each day is 3 more than the previous day. If he finishes all the candies in 5 days, how many candies did Mr. Wang eat on the second day?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Mr. Wang has 45 candies, and he eats some each day. From the second day onward, he eats 3 more candies each day than the previous day. He finishes all the candies in 5 days, and I need to find out how many candies he ate on the second day.Alright, let's break this down. First, it's about eating candies over 5 days with an increasing number each day. The increase is 3 candies each day starting from the second day. So, the number of candies eaten each day forms an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 3.Let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. In this case, the difference is 3. So, if I denote the number of candies eaten on the first day as 'a', then on the second day he eats 'a + 3', on the third day 'a + 6', and so on.Since he finishes all the candies in 5 days, the total number of candies eaten over these 5 days is 45. So, I can write an equation for the sum of the first 5 terms of this arithmetic sequence and set it equal to 45.The formula for the sum of the first 'n' terms of an arithmetic sequence is:S_n = n/2 * [2a + (n - 1)d]Where:- S_n is the sum of the first 'n' terms,- 'a' is the first term,- 'd' is the common difference,- 'n' is the number of terms.In this problem:- S_5 = 45,- n = 5,- d = 3.Plugging these values into the formula:45 = 5/2 * [2a + (5 - 1)*3]Simplify the equation step by step.First, calculate (5 - 1)*3:(5 - 1) = 44 * 3 = 12So, the equation becomes:45 = 5/2 * [2a + 12]Now, let's simplify the right side:5/2 * [2a + 12] = (5/2)*2a + (5/2)*12 = 5a + 30So, the equation is now:45 = 5a + 30To solve for 'a', subtract 30 from both sides:45 - 30 = 5a15 = 5aNow, divide both sides by 5:15 / 5 = a3 = aSo, the number of candies eaten on the first day is 3.Now, to find the number of candies eaten on the second day, which is 'a + 3':3 + 3 = 6Therefore, Mr. Wang ate 6 candies on the second day.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the sum formula:S_5 = 5/2 * [2a + 12] = 45Simplify:5/2 * [2a + 12] = 45Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:5 * [2a + 12] = 9010a + 60 = 90Subtract 60 from both sides:10a = 30Divide by 10:a = 3Yes, that's correct. So, the first day he ate 3 candies, and each subsequent day he ate 3 more than the previous day.So, the second day would be 3 + 3 = 6 candies.Just to be thorough, let's list out the number of candies eaten each day and add them up to ensure the total is 45.Day 1: 3Day 2: 6Day 3: 9Day 4: 12Day 5: 15Now, add them up:3 + 6 = 99 + 9 = 1818 + 12 = 3030 + 15 = 45Yes, that adds up to 45 candies in total over 5 days. So, the calculations are correct.Therefore, Mr. Wang ate 6 candies on the second day."},{"question":"Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that abc = 27. Find the minimum value of 3a + 2b + c.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of the expression (3a + 2b + c) given that (abc = 27) and (a), (b), (c) are positive real numbers. Hmm, I remember that for optimization problems with constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be used, but I also recall that the AM-GM inequality might be helpful here. Let me think about how to approach this.First, the AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In this case, I have three terms: (3a), (2b), and (c). Maybe I can apply AM-GM directly to these three terms. Let me write that down:[frac{3a + 2b + c}{3} geq sqrt[3]{(3a)(2b)(c)}]Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:[3a + 2b + c geq 3 sqrt[3]{6abc}]Since (abc = 27), I can substitute that into the equation:[3a + 2b + c geq 3 sqrt[3]{6 times 27}]Calculating the inside of the cube root:[6 times 27 = 162]So now the inequality becomes:[3a + 2b + c geq 3 sqrt[3]{162}]Hmm, I need to compute (sqrt[3]{162}). Let me see, 162 is 81 times 2, and 81 is 3^4. So:[sqrt[3]{162} = sqrt[3]{81 times 2} = sqrt[3]{3^4 times 2} = 3 sqrt[3]{3 times 2} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}]Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check:Actually, (162 = 27 times 6), and since 27 is a perfect cube, we can write:[sqrt[3]{162} = sqrt[3]{27 times 6} = sqrt[3]{27} times sqrt[3]{6} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}]Yes, that's correct. So substituting back:[3a + 2b + c geq 3 times 3 sqrt[3]{6} = 9 sqrt[3]{6}]Wait, but earlier I thought the minimum was 18. Did I make a mistake here? Let me go back.Hold on, in the initial step, I applied AM-GM to three terms: (3a), (2b), and (c). So the inequality should be:[frac{3a + 2b + c}{3} geq sqrt[3]{(3a)(2b)(c)}]Which simplifies to:[3a + 2b + c geq 3 sqrt[3]{6abc}]Since (abc = 27), then:[3 sqrt[3]{6 times 27} = 3 sqrt[3]{162}]But 162 is 27 times 6, so:[sqrt[3]{162} = sqrt[3]{27 times 6} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}]Therefore:[3a + 2b + c geq 3 times 3 sqrt[3]{6} = 9 sqrt[3]{6}]Hmm, so according to this, the minimum value is (9 sqrt[3]{6}), which is approximately 9 times 1.817, so about 16.35. But earlier I thought it was 18. Maybe I need to check my approach.Wait, perhaps I misapplied the AM-GM inequality. Let me think again. The AM-GM inequality for three variables says that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, for three positive numbers (x), (y), (z):[frac{x + y + z}{3} geq sqrt[3]{xyz}]In this case, if I let (x = 3a), (y = 2b), and (z = c), then:[frac{3a + 2b + c}{3} geq sqrt[3]{(3a)(2b)(c)} = sqrt[3]{6abc}]Since (abc = 27), this becomes:[frac{3a + 2b + c}{3} geq sqrt[3]{6 times 27} = sqrt[3]{162} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}]Multiplying both sides by 3:[3a + 2b + c geq 9 sqrt[3]{6}]So, the minimum value should be (9 sqrt[3]{6}). But wait, in the initial problem, the user mentioned getting 18 as the minimum. Maybe I need to consider another approach or check if equality can be achieved.For equality in AM-GM, all the terms must be equal. So, (3a = 2b = c). Let me set (3a = 2b = c = k). Then:[a = frac{k}{3}, quad b = frac{k}{2}, quad c = k]Now, substituting into the constraint (abc = 27):[left(frac{k}{3}right) left(frac{k}{2}right) (k) = frac{k^3}{6} = 27]Solving for (k):[k^3 = 27 times 6 = 162 implies k = sqrt[3]{162} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}]So, substituting back:[a = frac{3 sqrt[3]{6}}{3} = sqrt[3]{6}, quad b = frac{3 sqrt[3]{6}}{2}, quad c = 3 sqrt[3]{6}]Now, let's compute (3a + 2b + c):[3a = 3 times sqrt[3]{6} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}][2b = 2 times frac{3 sqrt[3]{6}}{2} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}][c = 3 sqrt[3]{6}]Adding them up:[3a + 2b + c = 3 sqrt[3]{6} + 3 sqrt[3]{6} + 3 sqrt[3]{6} = 9 sqrt[3]{6}]So, the minimum value is indeed (9 sqrt[3]{6}), which is approximately 16.35, not 18. It seems there was a mistake in the initial thought process where the user incorrectly calculated the cube root of 162 as 18. Let me verify that.Wait, actually, (sqrt[3]{162}) is not 18. Because (18^3 = 5832), which is way larger than 162. So, my calculation of (9 sqrt[3]{6}) seems correct.Alternatively, maybe the user tried to apply AM-GM differently, perhaps by considering weights. Let me think about that. The expression (3a + 2b + c) can be seen as a weighted sum. Maybe using weighted AM-GM.The weighted AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers and positive weights that sum to 1, the weighted arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the weighted geometric mean. However, in this case, the coefficients 3, 2, and 1 are not weights summing to 1, but rather coefficients in the linear combination.Alternatively, perhaps I can split the variables into multiple terms to apply AM-GM. For example, since the coefficients are 3, 2, and 1, I can think of (3a) as (a + a + a), (2b) as (b + b), and (c) as (c). Then, I have a total of 6 terms. Let me try that.So, writing (3a + 2b + c) as:[a + a + a + b + b + c]Now, applying AM-GM to these six terms:[frac{a + a + a + b + b + c}{6} geq sqrt[6]{a times a times a times b times b times c} = sqrt[6]{a^3 b^2 c}]Multiplying both sides by 6:[3a + 2b + c geq 6 sqrt[6]{a^3 b^2 c}]But we know that (abc = 27), so (a^3 b^2 c = (abc)^{2/3} times a^{3 - 2} = 27^{2/3} times a). Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, express (a^3 b^2 c) in terms of (abc):[a^3 b^2 c = a^2 b (abc) = a^2 b times 27]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let me express (a^3 b^2 c) as ( (a^3)(b^2)(c) ). Since (abc = 27), perhaps express (a), (b), (c) in terms of each other.Alternatively, let me consider the exponents. The exponents in (a^3 b^2 c) are 3, 2, and 1. The total number of terms in the AM-GM is 6, so the exponents add up to 6. Maybe I can write the geometric mean as:[sqrt[6]{a^3 b^2 c} = (a^3 b^2 c)^{1/6} = a^{1/2} b^{1/3} c^{1/6}]But I'm not sure how to relate this back to the constraint (abc = 27). Maybe taking logarithms? Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers would be a more straightforward method here. Let me set up the Lagrangian function:[mathcal{L}(a, b, c, lambda) = 3a + 2b + c - lambda (abc - 27)]Taking partial derivatives with respect to (a), (b), (c), and (lambda), and setting them equal to zero:1. (frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial a} = 3 - lambda bc = 0 implies 3 = lambda bc)2. (frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial b} = 2 - lambda ac = 0 implies 2 = lambda ac)3. (frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial c} = 1 - lambda ab = 0 implies 1 = lambda ab)4. (frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = -(abc - 27) = 0 implies abc = 27)From the first equation: (lambda = frac{3}{bc})From the second equation: (lambda = frac{2}{ac})Setting them equal:[frac{3}{bc} = frac{2}{ac} implies 3a = 2b implies a = frac{2b}{3}]From the third equation: (lambda = frac{1}{ab})Setting equal to the first equation:[frac{3}{bc} = frac{1}{ab} implies 3a = c]So, we have (a = frac{2b}{3}) and (c = 3a = 3 times frac{2b}{3} = 2b).Now, substituting (a = frac{2b}{3}) and (c = 2b) into the constraint (abc = 27):[left(frac{2b}{3}right) times b times 2b = 27]Simplifying:[frac{2b}{3} times b times 2b = frac{4b^3}{3} = 27]Solving for (b):[4b^3 = 81 implies b^3 = frac{81}{4} implies b = sqrt[3]{frac{81}{4}} = frac{3 sqrt[3]{6}}{2}]Then, (a = frac{2b}{3} = frac{2}{3} times frac{3 sqrt[3]{6}}{2} = sqrt[3]{6})And (c = 2b = 2 times frac{3 sqrt[3]{6}}{2} = 3 sqrt[3]{6})Now, compute (3a + 2b + c):[3a = 3 times sqrt[3]{6} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}][2b = 2 times frac{3 sqrt[3]{6}}{2} = 3 sqrt[3]{6}][c = 3 sqrt[3]{6}]Adding them up:[3a + 2b + c = 3 sqrt[3]{6} + 3 sqrt[3]{6} + 3 sqrt[3]{6} = 9 sqrt[3]{6}]So, the minimum value is indeed (9 sqrt[3]{6}). Therefore, the initial thought that the minimum was 18 was incorrect. It seems the user made a mistake in calculating the cube root of 162 as 18, which is not accurate. The correct minimum value is (9 sqrt[3]{6}).Alternatively, to express (sqrt[3]{6}) in a different form, since (6 = 2 times 3), we can write:[sqrt[3]{6} = sqrt[3]{2 times 3}]But it doesn't simplify further, so (9 sqrt[3]{6}) is the simplest form.To confirm, let me compute the numerical value:[sqrt[3]{6} approx 1.817][9 times 1.817 approx 16.353]So, the minimum value is approximately 16.35, which is less than 18. Therefore, the correct minimum value is (9 sqrt[3]{6}).I think the confusion arose from misapplying the AM-GM inequality by not correctly calculating the cube root. It's important to carefully compute each step, especially when dealing with exponents and roots. Using Lagrange multipliers helped me verify the correct result, ensuring that the equality conditions were properly satisfied.In summary, by applying the AM-GM inequality correctly and verifying with Lagrange multipliers, I determined that the minimum value of (3a + 2b + c) under the constraint (abc = 27) is (9 sqrt[3]{6})."},{"question":"Two identical books regularly cost a total of 36.

Assuming that those who draw later do not know the results of the previous draws, do all individuals have an equal probability of drawing the winning ticket, regardless of their position in the sequence?","answer":"Okay, so there's this problem about lottery tickets. Let me try to wrap my head around it. So, there are 5 lottery tickets, and only one of them is the winning ticket. Five people are going to take turns drawing one ticket each to see who gets the winning ticket. The question is, does everyone have the same chance of drawing the winning ticket, no matter when they draw?Alright, let's break this down. First, there are 5 tickets, 1 winning, 4 losing. Five people are drawing one ticket each, in some order. The key here is that the people who draw later don't know the results of the previous draws. So, each person is essentially drawing blindly, without any information about what happened before.I think the first thing to consider is the probability for the first person. There are 5 tickets, so the chance of drawing the winning one is 1 out of 5, or 1/5. That seems straightforward.Now, what about the second person? Well, if the first person didn't draw the winning ticket, then there are still 4 tickets left, one of which is winning. So, the second person has a 1 out of 4 chance, right? But wait, what if the first person did draw the winning ticket? Then the second person can't win. So, to find the overall probability for the second person, I need to consider both scenarios.So, the probability that the first person didn't win is 4/5, and then the second person has a 1/4 chance. So, the combined probability is (4/5) * (1/4) = 1/5. Interesting, so the second person also has a 1/5 chance.Hmm, does this pattern continue for the third, fourth, and fifth persons? Let's check the third person. For the third person to win, the first two people must have not won. The probability that the first person didn't win is 4/5, then the second person didn't win is 3/4 (since one losing ticket has already been drawn). So, the probability that the first two didn't win is (4/5) * (3/4) = 3/5. Then, the third person has a 1/3 chance to win. So, the combined probability is (3/5) * (1/3) = 1/5. Again, 1/5.This seems to be a pattern. Let's see for the fourth person. The first three must not have won. The probability that the first person didn't win is 4/5, the second person didn't win is 3/4, and the third person didn't win is 2/3. So, the combined probability is (4/5) * (3/4) * (2/3) = 2/5. Then, the fourth person has a 1/2 chance to win. So, the combined probability is (2/5) * (1/2) = 1/5.And finally, the fifth person. The first four must not have won. The probability is (4/5) * (3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/5. Then, the fifth person has a 1/1 chance, which is 1. So, the combined probability is (1/5) * 1 = 1/5.Wow, so no matter the position, each person has a 1/5 chance of drawing the winning ticket. That's interesting because at first glance, I might have thought that the first person has a higher chance, but it turns out it's equal for everyone.I guess this is because each draw is equally likely to be the winning ticket, and since the draws are without replacement, the probabilities adjust accordingly for each subsequent person. It's like the winning ticket has an equal chance to be in any position, so each person's turn is just as likely as any other.Another way to think about it is by considering all possible permutations of the tickets. There are 5! = 120 ways to arrange the tickets. The winning ticket can be in any of the 5 positions, and each position is equally likely. So, the probability of the winning ticket being in the first position is 1/5, the second position is 1/5, and so on.This makes sense because each ticket is equally likely to be drawn at any position, and since the draws are random and without replacement, there's no bias towards any particular position.So, in conclusion, yes, all individuals have an equal probability of drawing the winning ticket, regardless of their position in the sequence. Each person has a 1/5 chance of winning."},{"question":"Lina begins collecting stickers. She gathers three stickers on the first day and increases the number of stickers collected each day by two more than the previous day. How many stickers will she have collected by the end of the tenth day?","answer":"First, I need to identify the type of sequence involved in Lina's sticker collection.

Let me try to understand what it's asking and figure out how to solve it step by step.First, the problem has two parts. Part (1) is about finding the range of values for a real number m such that a specific point M is inside the curve C. Part (2) is about finding the range of chord lengths cut by the line l on the curve C when m is given as 3.Starting with part (1). The parametric equations for line l are given as x = t cos Œ± and y = t sin Œ±, where t is the parameter. So, this is a straight line passing through the origin because when t=0, both x and y are zero. The direction of the line depends on the angle Œ±.The curve C has a polar equation: œÅ¬≤ - 2mœÅ cos Œ∏ - 4 = 0, where m > 0. I need to convert this polar equation into Cartesian coordinates to understand what kind of curve it is. Remembering that in polar coordinates, œÅ¬≤ = x¬≤ + y¬≤, and œÅ cos Œ∏ = x. So substituting these into the equation:x¬≤ + y¬≤ - 2m x - 4 = 0.Let me rearrange this equation to see if it's a standard conic section. Moving the linear term to the other side:x¬≤ - 2m x + y¬≤ = 4.To complete the square for the x-terms, I'll take the coefficient of x, which is -2m, divide by 2 to get -m, and square it to get m¬≤. So adding and subtracting m¬≤:(x¬≤ - 2m x + m¬≤) + y¬≤ = 4 + m¬≤.This simplifies to:(x - m)¬≤ + y¬≤ = m¬≤ + 4.So, curve C is a circle with center at (m, 0) and radius sqrt(m¬≤ + 4). That makes sense because the standard equation of a circle is (x - h)¬≤ + (y - k)¬≤ = r¬≤, so here h = m, k = 0, and r = sqrt(m¬≤ + 4).Now, point M has Cartesian coordinates (3, 3). The problem states that M is inside curve C. So, I need to find the values of m such that the point (3, 3) lies inside the circle (x - m)¬≤ + y¬≤ = m¬≤ + 4.To check if a point is inside a circle, the distance from the point to the center of the circle must be less than the radius. So, let's compute the distance from (3, 3) to the center (m, 0):Distance = sqrt[(3 - m)¬≤ + (3 - 0)¬≤] = sqrt[(3 - m)¬≤ + 9].This distance must be less than the radius sqrt(m¬≤ + 4). So, setting up the inequality:sqrt[(3 - m)¬≤ + 9] < sqrt(m¬≤ + 4).To eliminate the square roots, I'll square both sides:(3 - m)¬≤ + 9 < m¬≤ + 4.Expanding (3 - m)¬≤:9 - 6m + m¬≤ + 9 < m¬≤ + 4.Combine like terms:9 + 9 - 6m + m¬≤ < m¬≤ + 4.18 - 6m + m¬≤ < m¬≤ + 4.Subtract m¬≤ from both sides:18 - 6m < 4.Subtract 18 from both sides:-6m < -14.Divide both sides by -6, remembering to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number:m > 14/6.Simplify 14/6:m > 7/3.So, the range of values for m is (7/3, +‚àû). That seems straightforward.Moving on to part (2). Now, m is given as 3. So, the equation of curve C becomes:(x - 3)¬≤ + y¬≤ = 3¬≤ + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13.So, curve C is a circle with center at (3, 0) and radius sqrt(13).The line l is given parametrically as x = t cos Œ±, y = t sin Œ±. So, this is a straight line passing through the origin with direction determined by angle Œ±. In polar coordinates, this line would be Œ∏ = Œ± because it's a straight line from the origin at angle Œ±.We need to find the chord length cut by line l on curve C as Œ± varies. So, essentially, for each angle Œ±, the line l will intersect the circle C at two points, and the distance between these two points is the chord length. We need to find the range of possible chord lengths as Œ± changes.First, let's find the points of intersection between line l and curve C. Since line l is Œ∏ = Œ± in polar coordinates, we can substitute Œ∏ = Œ± into the polar equation of curve C.The polar equation of curve C when m = 3 is:œÅ¬≤ - 2*3*œÅ cos Œ∏ - 4 = 0 => œÅ¬≤ - 6œÅ cos Œ∏ - 4 = 0.Substituting Œ∏ = Œ±, we get:œÅ¬≤ - 6œÅ cos Œ± - 4 = 0.This is a quadratic equation in œÅ. Let me denote œÅ as the variable:œÅ¬≤ - 6œÅ cos Œ± - 4 = 0.We can solve for œÅ using the quadratic formula:œÅ = [6 cos Œ± ¬± sqrt((6 cos Œ±)^2 + 16)] / 2.Simplify inside the square root:(6 cos Œ±)^2 = 36 cos¬≤ Œ±, so sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16) = sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16).So, œÅ = [6 cos Œ± ¬± sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16)] / 2.We can factor out a 2 from numerator and denominator:œÅ = [6 cos Œ± ¬± sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16)] / 2 = 3 cos Œ± ¬± (1/2) sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16).But actually, let's keep it as is for now. The two solutions correspond to the two points where the line l intersects the circle C. Let's denote these two solutions as œÅ‚ÇÅ and œÅ‚ÇÇ.So, œÅ‚ÇÅ = [6 cos Œ± + sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16)] / 2,and œÅ‚ÇÇ = [6 cos Œ± - sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16)] / 2.The chord length is the distance between these two points on the line l. Since both points lie on the same line through the origin, the chord length can be found by the difference in their radii. However, in polar coordinates, the chord length isn't just |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ| because the points are in opposite directions along the line. Wait, actually, since both points are on the same line through the origin, the distance between them is indeed |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ| because one is in the positive direction and the other is in the negative direction (if one is positive, the other could be negative, but in this case, since the line passes through the origin, the two points are on opposite sides of the origin).Wait, actually, let me think again. If the line passes through the origin, and the circle is centered at (3, 0) with radius sqrt(13), which is approximately 3.605. So, the origin is inside the circle because the distance from the origin to the center is 3, which is less than the radius sqrt(13) ‚âà 3.605. Therefore, the line l passes through the origin and intersects the circle at two points on either side of the origin. So, the chord length would be the distance between these two points, which is |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ|.But in polar coordinates, œÅ can be positive or negative, but in our case, since we're dealing with distances from the origin, œÅ is typically taken as positive. However, in the quadratic equation, we have two solutions, one positive and one negative, but since œÅ is a radius, we take the positive one. Wait, no, actually, in the quadratic equation, we have two solutions for œÅ, which can be both positive or one positive and one negative depending on the discriminant.Wait, let's compute œÅ‚ÇÅ and œÅ‚ÇÇ:œÅ‚ÇÅ = [6 cos Œ± + sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16)] / 2,œÅ‚ÇÇ = [6 cos Œ± - sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16)] / 2.Since sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16) is always positive, and 6 cos Œ± can be positive or negative depending on Œ±.But since m = 3, and the circle is centered at (3, 0), the line l passes through the origin, which is inside the circle. Therefore, the two intersection points are on opposite sides of the origin, so one œÅ is positive and the other is negative? Wait, no, in polar coordinates, œÅ is a distance, so it's always positive. Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.Wait, actually, in the quadratic equation, œÅ can be positive or negative, but in our case, since we're dealing with the distance from the origin, we take the positive roots. However, the two points of intersection are on the same line but on opposite sides of the origin, so their œÅ values would have opposite signs. But in our equation, both œÅ‚ÇÅ and œÅ‚ÇÇ are expressed in terms of cos Œ±, which can be positive or negative.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the chord length. The chord length is the distance between the two points where the line intersects the circle. Since both points lie on the line l, which is a straight line through the origin, the chord length can be found by the difference in their distances from the origin, but considering their directions.But actually, in Cartesian coordinates, the chord length can be found using the distance formula between the two points. However, since both points lie on the line l, which is Œ∏ = Œ±, their coordinates can be written as (œÅ‚ÇÅ cos Œ±, œÅ‚ÇÅ sin Œ±) and (œÅ‚ÇÇ cos Œ±, œÅ‚ÇÇ sin Œ±). The distance between these two points is sqrt[(œÅ‚ÇÅ cos Œ± - œÅ‚ÇÇ cos Œ±)^2 + (œÅ‚ÇÅ sin Œ± - œÅ‚ÇÇ sin Œ±)^2] = |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ| sqrt[cos¬≤ Œ± + sin¬≤ Œ±] = |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ|.So, the chord length is indeed |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ|.Now, let's compute |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ|. From the quadratic equation, we have:œÅ‚ÇÅ + œÅ‚ÇÇ = 6 cos Œ±,andœÅ‚ÇÅ œÅ‚ÇÇ = -4.Wait, that's interesting. The product of the roots is -4, which is negative. That means one root is positive and the other is negative. But in our case, œÅ is a distance, so it should be positive. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, no. In the quadratic equation, the product of the roots is c/a, which is -4/1 = -4. So, yes, one root is positive and the other is negative. However, in our case, since the line passes through the origin, which is inside the circle, the two intersection points are on opposite sides of the origin. So, one point is in the direction of Œ±, and the other is in the direction of Œ± + œÄ. Therefore, their œÅ values would have opposite signs. But in polar coordinates, œÅ is usually taken as positive, so we can consider the chord length as the sum of the absolute values of the two roots.Wait, but in our case, since one root is positive and the other is negative, the difference |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ| would actually be the sum of their magnitudes because one is positive and the other is negative. Let me verify.Suppose œÅ‚ÇÅ is positive and œÅ‚ÇÇ is negative. Then |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ| = |œÅ‚ÇÅ - (-|œÅ‚ÇÇ|)| = |œÅ‚ÇÅ + |œÅ‚ÇÇ|| = œÅ‚ÇÅ + |œÅ‚ÇÇ|. But since œÅ‚ÇÇ is negative, |œÅ‚ÇÇ| = -œÅ‚ÇÇ. So, |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ| = œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ.But from the quadratic equation, we have œÅ‚ÇÅ + œÅ‚ÇÇ = 6 cos Œ±,and œÅ‚ÇÅ œÅ‚ÇÇ = -4.So, let's compute |œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ|.We know that (œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ)^2 = (œÅ‚ÇÅ + œÅ‚ÇÇ)^2 - 4 œÅ‚ÇÅ œÅ‚ÇÇ.So,(œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ)^2 = (6 cos Œ±)^2 - 4*(-4) = 36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16.Therefore,|œÅ‚ÇÅ - œÅ‚ÇÇ| = sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16).So, the chord length is sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16).Now, we need to find the range of this chord length as Œ± varies. Since cos Œ± varies between -1 and 1, cos¬≤ Œ± varies between 0 and 1.Therefore, 36 cos¬≤ Œ± varies between 0 and 36.Adding 16, we get 36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16 varies between 16 and 52.Taking the square root, sqrt(36 cos¬≤ Œ± + 16) varies between sqrt(16) = 4 and sqrt(52) = 2 sqrt(13).Therefore, the chord length varies between 4 and 2 sqrt(13).So, the range of the chord length is [4, 2 sqrt(13)].Wait, let me double-check this. When cos Œ± = 0, the chord length is sqrt(0 + 16) = 4. When cos Œ± = 1 or -1, the chord length is sqrt(36 + 16) = sqrt(52) = 2 sqrt(13). So, yes, that makes sense.Therefore, the range of the chord length is from 4 to 2 sqrt(13).So, summarizing:(1) The range of m is (7/3, +‚àû).(2) The range of the chord length is [4, 2 sqrt(13)]."},{"question":"Let  a  and  b  be positive integers such that  text{gcd}(a, b) + text{lcm}(a, b)  is a multiple of  a+1 . If  b le a , show that  b  is a perfect square.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: Let ( a ) and ( b ) be positive integers such that ( text{gcd}(a, b) + text{lcm}(a, b) ) is a multiple of ( a + 1 ). And we're told that ( b leq a ). We need to show that ( b ) is a perfect square. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this step by step.First off, I remember that for any two positive integers ( a ) and ( b ), the relationship between gcd and lcm is given by:[text{gcd}(a, b) times text{lcm}(a, b) = a times b]So, if I denote ( d = text{gcd}(a, b) ), then I can write ( a = d cdot x ) and ( b = d cdot y ) where ( x ) and ( y ) are coprime integers (i.e., ( text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 )). That makes sense because ( d ) is the greatest common divisor, so ( x ) and ( y ) shouldn't have any common factors.Given that, the lcm of ( a ) and ( b ) would be:[text{lcm}(a, b) = frac{a times b}{text{gcd}(a, b)} = frac{d cdot x cdot d cdot y}{d} = d cdot x cdot y]So, putting it all together, ( text{gcd}(a, b) + text{lcm}(a, b) = d + d cdot x cdot y = d(1 + x y) ).Now, the problem states that this sum is a multiple of ( a + 1 ). Since ( a = d cdot x ), ( a + 1 = d cdot x + 1 ). Therefore, we have:[d(1 + x y) equiv 0 pmod{d x + 1}]Which means that ( d x + 1 ) divides ( d(1 + x y) ). Let me write that as:[d x + 1 mid d(1 + x y)]Hmm, okay. So, ( d x + 1 ) divides ( d(1 + x y) ). I need to find some relationship here that can help me show that ( b ) is a perfect square.Let me think about divisibility. If ( d x + 1 ) divides ( d(1 + x y) ), then there exists some integer ( k ) such that:[d(1 + x y) = k (d x + 1)]But I'm not sure if that's the most helpful approach. Maybe I can manipulate the congruence instead.Since ( d x + 1 ) divides ( d(1 + x y) ), we can write:[d(1 + x y) equiv 0 pmod{d x + 1}]Which implies:[d(1 + x y) equiv 0 pmod{d x + 1}]Let me try to simplify this congruence. Since ( d x equiv -1 pmod{d x + 1} ), because ( d x + 1 ) is the modulus, ( d x ) is congruent to ( -1 ) modulo ( d x + 1 ). So, substituting that in, we get:[d(1 + x y) equiv d(1 + y cdot (-1)) pmod{d x + 1}]Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. If ( d x equiv -1 pmod{d x + 1} ), then ( x y equiv (-1) cdot y cdot d^{-1} pmod{d x + 1} ). Hmm, that might not be straightforward. Maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, let's consider the expression ( d(1 + x y) ) modulo ( d x + 1 ). Since ( d x equiv -1 pmod{d x + 1} ), then ( x equiv -1/d pmod{d x + 1} ). But division by ( d ) modulo ( d x + 1 ) might not be straightforward unless ( d ) and ( d x + 1 ) are coprime. Let me check that.Since ( d ) divides ( a ) and ( a + 1 ) is the modulus, ( text{gcd}(d, d x + 1) ) must be 1 because any common divisor would have to divide 1. So, ( d ) and ( d x + 1 ) are coprime. That means I can multiply both sides of the congruence by the inverse of ( d ) modulo ( d x + 1 ). Let's denote ( d^{-1} ) as the inverse of ( d ) modulo ( d x + 1 ). Then, multiplying both sides by ( d^{-1} ), we get:[1 + x y equiv 0 pmod{d x + 1}]So, ( 1 + x y equiv 0 pmod{d x + 1} ). That simplifies things a bit.Now, let's write this as:[x y equiv -1 pmod{d x + 1}]Which means that ( x y + 1 ) is divisible by ( d x + 1 ). So, ( d x + 1 ) divides ( x y + 1 ). Hmm, interesting.But ( d x + 1 ) is greater than ( x y + 1 ) unless ( d ) is small. Wait, not necessarily. Let me think about the sizes here. Since ( b leq a ), and ( a = d x ), ( b = d y ), so ( d y leq d x ), which implies ( y leq x ). So, ( y leq x ). That might be useful.Given that ( d x + 1 ) divides ( x y + 1 ), and ( y leq x ), maybe we can find some relationship between ( d ) and ( y ).Let me consider that ( d x + 1 ) divides ( x y + 1 ). So, there exists an integer ( k ) such that:[x y + 1 = k (d x + 1)]Let me rearrange this equation:[x y + 1 = k d x + k]Bring all terms to one side:[x y - k d x + 1 - k = 0]Factor out ( x ) from the first two terms:[x (y - k d) + (1 - k) = 0]Hmm, so:[x (y - k d) = k - 1]Since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers, and ( k ) is also an integer, let's think about possible values of ( k ).Given that ( d x + 1 ) divides ( x y + 1 ), and ( d x + 1 ) is positive, ( k ) must be positive as well. Also, since ( x y + 1 ) is positive, ( k ) must be such that ( k (d x + 1) ) is less than or equal to ( x y + 1 ). So, ( k leq frac{x y + 1}{d x + 1} ).But ( y leq x ), so ( x y leq x^2 ). Therefore, ( frac{x y + 1}{d x + 1} leq frac{x^2 + 1}{d x + 1} ). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Wait, let's go back to the equation:[x (y - k d) = k - 1]Since ( x ) is a positive integer, the right-hand side ( k - 1 ) must be divisible by ( x ). So, ( x ) divides ( k - 1 ). Let me write ( k - 1 = x cdot m ) where ( m ) is an integer. Then, ( k = x cdot m + 1 ).Substituting back into the equation:[x (y - (x cdot m + 1) d) = x cdot m]Divide both sides by ( x ) (since ( x ) is positive and non-zero):[y - (x cdot m + 1) d = m]Rearranged:[y = (x cdot m + 1) d + m]Factor out ( m ):[y = m (x d + 1) + d]Hmm, interesting. So, ( y ) is expressed in terms of ( m ), ( x ), and ( d ). Let me write this as:[y = d + m (x d + 1)]Since ( y ) must be a positive integer, ( m ) must be a non-negative integer. Let's consider possible values of ( m ).Case 1: ( m = 0 )Then, ( y = d + 0 = d ). So, ( y = d ). Let's see if this works.If ( y = d ), then from ( b = d y ), we get ( b = d^2 ). So, ( b ) is a perfect square, which is exactly what we need to show. So, if ( m = 0 ), we're done.But we need to check if this is the only possibility. Let's see.Case 2: ( m geq 1 )Then, ( y = d + m (x d + 1) ). Since ( y leq x ) (because ( b = d y leq a = d x )), we have:[d + m (x d + 1) leq x]But ( m geq 1 ), so:[d + x d + 1 leq x]Simplify:[d (1 + x) + 1 leq x]But ( d ) is at least 1, so:[(1 + x) + 1 leq x]Which simplifies to:[x + 2 leq x]Which is impossible because ( 2 leq 0 ) is false. Therefore, ( m geq 1 ) leads to a contradiction. So, the only possible case is ( m = 0 ), which gives ( y = d ).Therefore, ( y = d ), so ( b = d y = d^2 ), which is a perfect square. Hence, ( b ) must be a perfect square.Wait, let me double-check this reasoning. So, we started by expressing ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of their gcd, then manipulated the given divisibility condition to find that ( y = d ), leading to ( b = d^2 ). That seems solid. Also, the case where ( m geq 1 ) led to an impossible inequality, so ( m ) must be zero. Therefore, ( b ) is indeed a perfect square.I think that wraps it up. So, the conclusion is that ( b ) must be a perfect square under the given conditions.**Final Answer**boxed{b} is a perfect square."},{"question":"Let proposition p: For all a>0, a neq 1, the function f(x) = a^x - x - a has a zero.

Remember, the negation of a universal quantifier (\\"for all\\") is an existential quantifier (\\"there exists\\"). So, ¬¨p should state that there exists some a > 0, a ‚â† 1, for which the function f(x) = a^x - x - a does not have a zero.Let me write that out to make sure I get it right. The original statement p is: ‚àÄa > 0, a ‚â† 1, ‚àÉx, f(x) = 0. So, the negation ¬¨p would be: ‚àÉa > 0, a ‚â† 1, ‚àÄx, f(x) ‚â† 0. That is, there exists some a > 0, a ‚â† 1, such that for all x, f(x) is not zero.Hmm, wait, does that make sense? Let me think again. The original statement is saying that for every a, there is some x where f(x) is zero. So, the negation would mean that there is at least one a for which no x makes f(x) zero. Yeah, that seems right.So, in plain English, ¬¨p would be: There exists a positive number a, not equal to 1, such that the function f(x) = a^x - x - a has no zero. That is, for this particular a, there is no x where f(x) equals zero.Let me check if I'm applying the negation correctly. The original statement is a universal statement about all a, so the negation should be an existential statement about some a. Then, within that, the negation of \\"there exists x such that f(x) = 0\\" is \\"for all x, f(x) ‚â† 0.\\" So, yes, that seems correct.I think I got it. So, the negation of p is that there is at least one a > 0, a ‚â† 1, where the function f(x) doesn't cross zero. That is, f(x) is always positive or always negative for all x.Wait, but does that necessarily mean f(x) is always positive or always negative? Or could it just not cross zero for some other reason? Hmm, well, if f(x) doesn't have a zero, it means that f(x) never equals zero for any x. So, depending on the function, it could be always positive or always negative, or maybe it oscillates but never actually reaches zero. But in this case, since f(x) is a combination of an exponential function and a linear function, it's more likely that it either stays positive or negative.Let me think about f(x) = a^x - x - a. For a > 1, a^x grows exponentially, while -x - a is linear. So, as x increases, a^x will dominate, making f(x) positive. As x decreases, a^x approaches zero, so f(x) approaches -x - a, which, for negative x, becomes positive as well. Wait, so does that mean f(x) is always positive for a > 1? Hmm, maybe not necessarily. Let me plug in x = 0: f(0) = 1 - 0 - a = 1 - a. So, if a > 1, f(0) is negative. If 0 < a < 1, f(0) is positive.So, for a > 1, f(0) is negative, and as x increases, f(x) becomes positive. So, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, since f(x) is continuous, there must be some x where f(x) = 0. Similarly, for 0 < a < 1, f(0) is positive, and as x approaches infinity, a^x approaches zero, so f(x) approaches -x - a, which goes to negative infinity. So, again, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, f(x) must cross zero somewhere.Wait, so does that mean that for all a > 0, a ‚â† 1, f(x) has a zero? That would mean that the original proposition p is actually true, and thus its negation ¬¨p is false. But the problem is just asking for the negation, not whether it's true or false.But just to be thorough, let me think again. For a > 1, f(0) = 1 - a < 0, and as x increases, f(x) tends to infinity, so it must cross zero. For 0 < a < 1, f(0) = 1 - a > 0, and as x increases, f(x) tends to negative infinity, so it must cross zero. Therefore, for all a > 0, a ‚â† 1, f(x) has a zero. So, p is true, and ¬¨p is false.But the question is just about forming the negation, not about its truth value. So, to recap, ¬¨p is: There exists a > 0, a ‚â† 1, such that f(x) = a^x - x - a has no zero.I think that's correct. The negation flips the universal quantifier to existential and negates the inner statement. So, instead of saying for all a, there's an x, it's saying there's an a for which for all x, the function doesn't have a zero.Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think I've got it."},{"question":"If the simplest quadratic radical sqrt{1+a} can be combined with sqrt{4-2a}, then the value of a is ( ).A: a=-dfrac{3}{4}B: a=dfrac{4}{3}C: a=1D: a=-1","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: \\"If the simplest quadratic radical ‚àö(1+a) can be combined with ‚àö(4-2a), then the value of a is ( ).\\" The options are A: a = -3/4, B: a = 4/3, C: a = 1, and D: a = -1.Hmm, okay. I need to figure out what value of 'a' makes these two radicals combinable. I remember that to combine radicals, they need to be like terms, which means their radicands (the expressions under the square roots) must be equal. So, if ‚àö(1+a) and ‚àö(4-2a) can be combined, then 1+a must equal 4-2a.Let me write that down:1 + a = 4 - 2aNow, I need to solve for 'a'. Let's see, I can start by getting all the 'a' terms on one side and the constants on the other. So, I'll add 2a to both sides to get rid of the -2a on the right.1 + a + 2a = 4 - 2a + 2aSimplifying that:1 + 3a = 4Now, I need to isolate 'a', so I'll subtract 1 from both sides.1 + 3a - 1 = 4 - 1Which simplifies to:3a = 3Okay, now I can divide both sides by 3 to solve for 'a'.3a / 3 = 3 / 3So,a = 1Wait, that's one of the options. Option C is a = 1. So, is that the answer? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Let me plug a = 1 back into both radicals:First radical: ‚àö(1 + 1) = ‚àö2Second radical: ‚àö(4 - 2*1) = ‚àö(4 - 2) = ‚àö2Yes, both radicals become ‚àö2, which means they are like terms and can be combined. So, that seems correct.Just to be thorough, let me check the other options to ensure none of them work.Option A: a = -3/4First radical: ‚àö(1 + (-3/4)) = ‚àö(1/4) = 1/2Second radical: ‚àö(4 - 2*(-3/4)) = ‚àö(4 + 3/2) = ‚àö(11/2) ‚âà 2.345These are not equal, so they can't be combined. So, A is not correct.Option B: a = 4/3First radical: ‚àö(1 + 4/3) = ‚àö(7/3) ‚âà 1.528Second radical: ‚àö(4 - 2*(4/3)) = ‚àö(4 - 8/3) = ‚àö(4/3) ‚âà 1.154Again, not equal, so they can't be combined. So, B is out.Option D: a = -1First radical: ‚àö(1 + (-1)) = ‚àö0 = 0Second radical: ‚àö(4 - 2*(-1)) = ‚àö(4 + 2) = ‚àö6 ‚âà 2.449Zero and ‚àö6 are not like terms, so they can't be combined. So, D is also incorrect.Therefore, the only correct answer is C: a = 1.I think I've covered all the bases here. I set the radicands equal, solved for 'a', checked the solution by plugging it back in, and even verified that the other options don't work. So, I'm confident that C is the right choice."},{"question":"Find the sum of the rational roots of the polynomial ( f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 8 ).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the sum of the rational roots of the polynomial ( f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 8 ). Hmm, let's see. I remember something called the Rational Root Theorem from algebra. I think it says that any possible rational root, expressed in the form ( frac{p}{q} ), has ( p ) as a factor of the constant term and ( q ) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this polynomial, the constant term is -8, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible values for ( p ) are the divisors of -8, which are ( pm1, pm2, pm4, pm8 ). Since the leading coefficient is 1, ( q ) can only be ( pm1 ). That means all the possible rational roots are just ( pm1, pm2, pm4, pm8 ).Alright, so I need to test each of these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial to see if they result in zero. Let's start with ( x = 1 ):( f(1) = 1^3 - 9(1)^2 + 27(1) - 8 = 1 - 9 + 27 - 8 = 11 ). That's not zero, so 1 isn't a root.Next, ( x = -1 ):( f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 9(-1)^2 + 27(-1) - 8 = -1 - 9 - 27 - 8 = -45 ). Also not zero.Moving on to ( x = 2 ):( f(2) = 2^3 - 9(2)^2 + 27(2) - 8 = 8 - 36 + 54 - 8 = 18 ). Still not zero.How about ( x = -2 ):( f(-2) = (-2)^3 - 9(-2)^2 + 27(-2) - 8 = -8 - 36 - 54 - 8 = -106 ). Nope.Trying ( x = 4 ):( f(4) = 4^3 - 9(4)^2 + 27(4) - 8 = 64 - 144 + 108 - 8 = 20 ). Not zero either.What about ( x = -4 ):( f(-4) = (-4)^3 - 9(-4)^2 + 27(-4) - 8 = -64 - 144 - 108 - 8 = -324 ). Definitely not zero.Let's check ( x = 8 ):( f(8) = 8^3 - 9(8)^2 + 27(8) - 8 = 512 - 576 + 216 - 8 = 144 ). Still not zero.And finally, ( x = -8 ):( f(-8) = (-8)^3 - 9(-8)^2 + 27(-8) - 8 = -512 - 576 - 216 - 8 = -1312 ). Not zero.Hmm, none of these possible rational roots are actually roots of the polynomial. That means this polynomial doesn't have any rational roots. So, the sum of the rational roots would just be zero because there are none.Wait, but I also remember that for a cubic polynomial ( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d ), the sum of all its roots (real and complex) is given by ( -b/a ). In this case, that would be ( -(-9)/1 = 9 ). But since all the roots might not be rational, the sum of just the rational roots is zero because there are no rational roots. So, yeah, I think the sum of the rational roots is zero."},{"question":"Let (O) be the origin.

Find (k').","answer":"Okay, so I have this vector equation: 4OA - 3OB + 6OC + k'OD = 0And I need to find the scalar k' such that points A, B, C, D are coplanar. Hmm, coplanar means all four points lie on the same plane. I remember that for points to be coplanar, the vectors connecting them must be linearly dependent. So, maybe I can use some properties of vectors and linear dependence here.First, let me rewrite the equation:4OA - 3OB + 6OC + k'OD = 0I can rearrange this to group the vectors:4OA - 3OB = -6OC - k'ODLet me denote the left side as a vector OP, so:OP = 4OA - 3OBSimilarly, the right side can be written as:OP = -6OC - k'ODSo, OP is equal to both expressions. That means the point P defined by OP lies on both lines AB and CD. Wait, is that right? Because OP is a linear combination of OA and OB, so it lies on line AB if the coefficients add up to 1. Let me check:4 + (-3) = 1Yes, so OP is indeed a point on line AB. Similarly, for OP to lie on line CD, the coefficients of OC and OD should add up to 1. Let's see:-6 + (-k') = 1So, solving for k':-6 - k' = 1Subtract -6 from both sides:-k' = 1 + 6-k' = 7Multiply both sides by -1:k' = -7So, k' is -7. Let me double-check this. If k' is -7, then the equation becomes:4OA - 3OB + 6OC -7OD = 0Which can be rearranged as:4OA - 3OB = -6OC +7ODWait, that doesn't seem to add up. Let me check my earlier reasoning.I had OP = 4OA - 3OB and OP = -6OC -k'OD. So, the coefficients on the right side should add up to 1 for OP to lie on CD. So, -6 + (-k') = 1, which gives k' = -7. That seems correct.Alternatively, I can think about the affine combination. For four points to be coplanar, the coefficients in the linear combination should add up to 1. Let me see:In the original equation, 4 - 3 + 6 + k' = 0?Wait, no. The sum of the coefficients is 4 - 3 + 6 + k' = 7 + k'. For the points to be coplanar, the sum of the coefficients should be zero? Or is it something else?Wait, no, that's for the affine combination. If the sum of the coefficients is zero, it's a linear combination, not necessarily affine. For affine combinations, the sum should be 1. Hmm, maybe I confused something.Let me recall: If you have points A, B, C, D, and a linear combination of their position vectors equals zero, then the points are coplanar if the coefficients satisfy certain conditions.Wait, another approach: The four points are coplanar if the vectors AB, AC, AD are linearly dependent. So, maybe I can express this condition using the given equation.But perhaps the initial approach was correct. Since OP is on both AB and CD, then lines AB and CD intersect at P, which would imply that all four points lie on the same plane. So, to have OP lie on CD, the coefficients of OC and OD must add to 1. So, -6 -k' = 1, leading to k' = -7.I think that's the right answer. Let me see if there's another way to confirm this.Alternatively, I can think of the equation as:4OA - 3OB + 6OC + k'OD = 0Which can be rewritten as:4OA - 3OB + 6OC = -k'ODDividing both sides by -k':(4/-k')OA + (-3/-k')OB + (6/-k')OC = ODSo, OD is an affine combination of OA, OB, OC if 4/-k' + (-3)/-k' + 6/-k' = 1Calculating the sum:(4 -3 +6)/-k' = (7)/-k' = 1So, 7/-k' =1 => -k' =7 => k' = -7Yes, that confirms it. So, k' is indeed -7.**Final Answer**boxed{-7}"},{"question":"Let {a_{n}} be a sequence of positive terms in geometric progression, and let S_{n} be the sum of the first n terms. If S_{3}=7 and a_{3}=4, find:<br/>(1) The general formula for the sequence {a_{n}};<br/>(2) Whether there exist three different terms in the sequence {S_{n}} that form an arithmetic progression. Please explain your reasoning.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to understand it step by step. First, the problem says that {a_n} is a geometric progression with positive terms. That means each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. I remember that in a geometric sequence, the nth term is given by a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term and r is the common ratio.We are given two pieces of information: S_3 = 7 and a_3 = 4. S_n is the sum of the first n terms. So, S_3 is the sum of the first three terms, which is 7. And the third term, a_3, is 4.Let me write down what I know:1. S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 72. a_3 = a_1 * r^2 = 4Since it's a geometric progression, I can express a_2 and a_3 in terms of a_1 and r. So, a_2 = a_1 * r and a_3 = a_1 * r^2.Substituting these into the sum S_3:a_1 + a_1*r + a_1*r^2 = 7And from a_3, we have:a_1*r^2 = 4So, I can use these two equations to solve for a_1 and r.Let me solve the second equation for a_1:a_1 = 4 / r^2Now, substitute this into the first equation:(4 / r^2) + (4 / r^2)*r + (4 / r^2)*r^2 = 7Simplify each term:First term: 4 / r^2Second term: (4 / r^2)*r = 4 / rThird term: (4 / r^2)*r^2 = 4So, the equation becomes:4 / r^2 + 4 / r + 4 = 7Let me subtract 7 from both sides to set the equation to zero:4 / r^2 + 4 / r + 4 - 7 = 0Simplify:4 / r^2 + 4 / r - 3 = 0Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of 1/r. Let me make a substitution to make it easier. Let x = 1/r. Then, the equation becomes:4x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0Now, I can solve this quadratic equation for x.Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ¬± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)Here, a = 4, b = 4, c = -3So,x = [-4 ¬± sqrt(16 - 4*4*(-3))] / (2*4)x = [-4 ¬± sqrt(16 + 48)] / 8x = [-4 ¬± sqrt(64)] / 8x = [-4 ¬± 8] / 8So, two solutions:x = (-4 + 8)/8 = 4/8 = 1/2x = (-4 - 8)/8 = -12/8 = -3/2But x = 1/r, and since the terms are positive, r must be positive. So, x must be positive. Therefore, x = 1/2.So, 1/r = 1/2 => r = 2Now, substitute back to find a_1:a_1 = 4 / r^2 = 4 / (2)^2 = 4 / 4 = 1So, the first term a_1 is 1, and the common ratio r is 2.Therefore, the general formula for the sequence {a_n} is:a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1) = 1 * 2^(n-1) = 2^(n-1)Okay, that takes care of part (1). Now, part (2) asks whether there exist three different terms in the sequence {S_n} that form an arithmetic progression.First, let me recall that S_n is the sum of the first n terms of the geometric sequence. Since we have a geometric sequence with r = 2, the sum S_n is given by:S_n = a_1 * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1) = 1 * (2^n - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^n - 1So, S_n = 2^n - 1Now, we need to check if there exist three different terms S_m, S_n, S_p (with m < n < p) such that they form an arithmetic progression.An arithmetic progression means that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, for three terms S_m, S_n, S_p to be in arithmetic progression, the following must hold:2*S_n = S_m + S_pSo, let's write this condition:2*(2^n - 1) = (2^m - 1) + (2^p - 1)Simplify the right-hand side:(2^m - 1) + (2^p - 1) = 2^m + 2^p - 2So, the equation becomes:2*(2^n - 1) = 2^m + 2^p - 2Simplify the left-hand side:2*(2^n - 1) = 2^(n+1) - 2So, now we have:2^(n+1) - 2 = 2^m + 2^p - 2Add 2 to both sides:2^(n+1) = 2^m + 2^pSo, 2^(n+1) = 2^m + 2^pLet me factor out 2^m from the right-hand side:2^(n+1) = 2^m (1 + 2^(p - m))Let me denote k = p - m, which is a positive integer since p > m.So, 2^(n+1) = 2^m (1 + 2^k)Divide both sides by 2^m:2^(n+1 - m) = 1 + 2^kLet me denote t = n + 1 - m. Since n > m, t is a positive integer.So, 2^t = 1 + 2^kNow, we have 2^t - 2^k = 1Let me factor out 2^k:2^k (2^(t - k) - 1) = 1Since 2^k and (2^(t - k) - 1) are both integers, and their product is 1, which is only possible if both factors are 1.So,2^k = 1 and 2^(t - k) - 1 = 1But 2^k = 1 implies k = 0, but k = p - m, and p > m, so k must be at least 1. Therefore, this is a contradiction.Alternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again.Wait, 2^t - 2^k = 1We can write this as 2^k (2^(t - k) - 1) = 1Since 2^k and (2^(t - k) - 1) are both positive integers, and their product is 1, the only possibility is that both are 1.So, 2^k = 1 and 2^(t - k) - 1 = 1But 2^k = 1 implies k = 0, which is not possible because k = p - m ‚â• 1.Therefore, there are no positive integers t and k such that 2^t - 2^k = 1, except when k = 0, which is not allowed here.Hence, there do not exist three different terms in the sequence {S_n} that form an arithmetic progression.Wait, but let me test with some small n, m, p to see if this holds.For example, take m=1, n=2, p=3.Compute S_1 = 2^1 -1 =1S_2 = 2^2 -1=3S_3=2^3 -1=7Check if 2*S_2 = S_1 + S_32*3=1+7 =>6=8? No, that's not true.Another example, m=2, n=3, p=4.S_2=3, S_3=7, S_4=15Check 2*7=3+15 =>14=18? No.Another one, m=1, n=3, p=5.S_1=1, S_3=7, S_5=312*7=1+31 =>14=32? No.Hmm, seems like it's not working. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, think about the equation 2^(n+1) = 2^m + 2^pWe can write this as 2^m (1 + 2^(p - m)) = 2^(n+1)Since 2^m divides the left side, it must divide the right side, which is 2^(n+1). Therefore, m ‚â§ n+1.Similarly, 1 + 2^(p - m) must be a power of 2, because the left side is 2^m times something, and the right side is a power of 2.So, 1 + 2^(p - m) must be a power of 2.Let me denote k = p - m, so 1 + 2^k must be a power of 2.But 1 + 2^k is a power of 2 only when k=0 or k=1.Wait, 1 + 2^0=2, which is 2^1.1 + 2^1=3, which is not a power of 2.1 + 2^2=5, not a power of 2.1 + 2^3=9, not a power of 2.Wait, but k must be at least 1 because p > m.So, when k=1, 1 + 2^1=3, which is not a power of 2.Therefore, there is no k ‚â•1 such that 1 + 2^k is a power of 2.Hence, the equation 2^(n+1) = 2^m + 2^p has no solution in positive integers m < n < p.Therefore, there do not exist three different terms in the sequence {S_n} that form an arithmetic progression.I think that's a solid reasoning. I tried plugging in some small numbers and also approached it algebraically, both leading to the conclusion that it's not possible."},{"question":"Given the polynomial  a_0x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+cdots+a_{n-1}x+a_n , where  n  is a positive integer or zero, and  a_0  is a positive integer.

I need to find how many such polynomials exist where h equals 3. The answer choices are from A to E, with numbers 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The polynomial is given as a0x^n + a1x^{n-1} + ... + a_{n-1}x + a_n. Here, n is a non-negative integer (so it can be 0, 1, 2, ...), a0 is a positive integer, and the rest of the coefficients a1, a2, ..., a_n can be any integers or zero. The value h is calculated as n + a0 + |a1| + |a2| + ... + |a_n|. So, h is the sum of the degree of the polynomial, the leading coefficient, and the absolute values of all the other coefficients. We need to find how many such polynomials exist where h is exactly 3. Let me think about how to approach this. Since h is 3, and h is the sum of n, a0, and the absolute values of the coefficients, each of these components must be non-negative integers. Also, since a0 is a positive integer, it must be at least 1. So, let's break this down by considering different possible values of n, starting from the smallest possible n, which is 0, and moving up. For each n, I'll figure out the possible values of a0 and the coefficients a1, a2, ..., a_n such that the sum h equals 3.Starting with n = 0. If n = 0, then the polynomial is just a constant term, which is a0. So, the polynomial is a0. Then, h = n + a0 + |a1| + ... + |a_n|. But since n = 0, there are no other coefficients, so h = 0 + a0. Therefore, h = a0. Since h must be 3, a0 must be 3. So, the only polynomial in this case is 3. That's one polynomial.Next, n = 1. Then, the polynomial is a0x + a1. So, h = 1 + a0 + |a1|. We need this to equal 3. So, 1 + a0 + |a1| = 3. Therefore, a0 + |a1| = 2. Since a0 is a positive integer, possible values for a0 are 1 and 2.If a0 = 1, then |a1| = 1. Since a1 can be any integer, |a1| = 1 means a1 can be 1 or -1. So, we have two polynomials here: x + 1 and x - 1.If a0 = 2, then |a1| = 0. That means a1 must be 0. So, the polynomial is 2x. That's one polynomial.So, for n = 1, we have three polynomials: x + 1, x - 1, and 2x.Moving on to n = 2. The polynomial is a0x^2 + a1x + a2. Then, h = 2 + a0 + |a1| + |a2|. We need this to equal 3. So, 2 + a0 + |a1| + |a2| = 3. Therefore, a0 + |a1| + |a2| = 1.Since a0 is a positive integer, the smallest it can be is 1. If a0 = 1, then |a1| + |a2| = 0. Since absolute values are non-negative, this implies that both |a1| and |a2| must be 0. Therefore, a1 = 0 and a2 = 0. So, the polynomial is x^2. That's one polynomial.If a0 were 2, then |a1| + |a2| would have to be -1, which is impossible because absolute values can't be negative. Similarly, a0 can't be more than 1 because that would make the sum even more negative. So, only one polynomial exists for n = 2.Now, n = 3. The polynomial is a0x^3 + a1x^2 + a2x + a3. Then, h = 3 + a0 + |a1| + |a2| + |a3|. We need this to equal 3. So, 3 + a0 + |a1| + |a2| + |a3| = 3. Therefore, a0 + |a1| + |a2| + |a3| = 0.But a0 is a positive integer, so it must be at least 1. Therefore, the sum a0 + |a1| + |a2| + |a3| must be at least 1, which contradicts the requirement that it equals 0. So, there are no polynomials for n = 3.Similarly, for n >= 4, the value of h would be at least n, which is already 4 or more, so h would be greater than 3. Therefore, no polynomials exist for n >= 3.So, summarizing the cases:- n = 0: 1 polynomial (3)- n = 1: 3 polynomials (x + 1, x - 1, 2x)- n = 2: 1 polynomial (x^2)- n >= 3: 0 polynomialsAdding them up: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 polynomials.Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any cases or made any mistakes.For n = 0: Only a0 = 3, so that's correct.For n = 1: a0 + |a1| = 2. a0 can be 1 or 2. If a0 = 1, |a1| = 1, giving two polynomials. If a0 = 2, |a1| = 0, giving one polynomial. So, total 3. That seems correct.For n = 2: a0 + |a1| + |a2| = 1. Since a0 is at least 1, the only possibility is a0 = 1 and |a1| + |a2| = 0, which gives a1 = 0 and a2 = 0. So, only x^2. Correct.For n = 3 and above: Impossible, as explained. So, 0.Total is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5. So, the answer should be 5, which is option B.But wait, let me think again. The problem says \\"the number of polynomials with h=3\\". So, are we considering different polynomials as distinct if their coefficients differ, even if they are the same function? For example, x + 1 and x - 1 are different polynomials because their coefficients are different. Similarly, 2x is different from x. So, yes, they are distinct.Also, for n = 2, x^2 is the only one because all other coefficients must be zero.Is there any other case where n could be something else? For example, n = 0, 1, 2, 3,... We've covered all possible n where h could be 3.Wait, another thought: For n = 0, the polynomial is just a constant. So, h = 0 + a0 = a0. So, a0 must be 3, which is correct.For n = 1, h = 1 + a0 + |a1|. So, a0 + |a1| = 2. So, a0 can be 1 or 2. If a0 = 1, |a1| = 1, which gives two polynomials. If a0 = 2, |a1| = 0, which gives one polynomial. So, total 3.For n = 2, h = 2 + a0 + |a1| + |a2|. So, a0 + |a1| + |a2| = 1. Since a0 is at least 1, the rest must be zero. So, only x^2.For n = 3, h = 3 + a0 + |a1| + |a2| + |a3|. So, a0 + |a1| + |a2| + |a3| = 0, which is impossible because a0 is at least 1.So, yeah, 5 polynomials in total.Wait, but let me think about whether there are any other possibilities for n = 1. For example, could a0 be 3 and |a1| be -1? No, because |a1| is always non-negative, so that's not possible. Similarly, a0 can't be zero because it's a positive integer.So, yeah, I think 5 is correct. So, the answer is B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"The parabolic curve y=2left(x+3right)^{2}-3 opens in the direction of ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation of a parabola: y equals 2 times (x plus 3) squared minus 3. I need to figure out which direction it opens. Hmm, I remember that parabolas can open up, down, left, or right, but I think this one is probably opening up or down because it's in terms of y.Let me recall the standard form of a parabola. I think it's something like y equals a times (x minus h) squared plus k. Yeah, that sounds right. In this form, the vertex is at (h, k), and the value of 'a' determines the direction it opens. If 'a' is positive, it opens upwards, and if 'a' is negative, it opens downwards.Looking at my equation, y equals 2 times (x plus 3) squared minus 3, I can compare it to the standard form. So, h is -3 because it's (x minus (-3)), and k is -3. But what's 'a'? It's the coefficient in front of the squared term, which is 2. Okay, so 'a' is 2.Since 'a' is positive, that means the parabola opens upwards. Wait, is there any chance it could open downwards? No, because 'a' is positive. If it were negative, like y equals -2 times (x plus 3) squared minus 3, then it would open downwards. But in this case, it's positive, so it's definitely opening upwards.Let me double-check. The standard form is y equals a(x - h)^2 + k. My equation is y equals 2(x + 3)^2 - 3. So, h is -3 and k is -3, and 'a' is 2. Yep, that confirms it. Positive 'a' means it opens upwards.I think I've got it. The parabola opens upwards because the coefficient in front of the squared term is positive. There's no negative sign there, so it's not opening downwards. It's definitely opening upwards."},{"question":"Triangle PQR is a right triangle with legs PQ and PR.

Points U and V are on PQ and PR respectively, and the ratios PU:UQ and PV:VR are both 1:3. They also give me that QU is 18 units and RV is 45 units. I need to find the length of the hypotenuse PQ. Hmm, wait, actually, since it's a right triangle with legs PQ and PR, the hypotenuse should be QR, right? Maybe the problem meant QR? Or maybe it's a typo and they actually want the length of PR or PQ? Wait, no, let me read it again.\\"Triangle PQR is a right triangle with legs PQ and PR. Points U and V are on legs PQ and PR, respectively so that PU:UQ = PV:VR = 1:3. If QU = 18 units, and RV = 45 units, what is the length of hypotenuse PQ? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\\"Wait, so the hypotenuse is PQ? That doesn't make sense because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So if the legs are PQ and PR, then the right angle must be at P, making QR the hypotenuse. So maybe it's a typo, and they meant QR? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the labeling. Let me try to visualize the triangle.Let me sketch it out mentally. Point P is the right angle, so PQ and PR are the legs, and QR is the hypotenuse. Points U and V are on PQ and PR respectively. The ratios PU:UQ and PV:VR are both 1:3. So PU is one part, UQ is three parts, and similarly PV is one part, VR is three parts.Given that QU is 18 units, which is the longer segment on PQ, and RV is 45 units, which is the longer segment on PR. So if PU:UQ is 1:3, then UQ is 3 parts, which is 18 units. So each part is 6 units. Therefore, PU is 6 units, and UQ is 18 units, making the entire length of PQ equal to PU + UQ = 6 + 18 = 24 units.Similarly, for PV:VR = 1:3, RV is 45 units, which is three parts. So each part is 15 units. Therefore, PV is 15 units, and VR is 45 units, making the entire length of PR equal to PV + VR = 15 + 45 = 60 units.Now, since PQR is a right triangle with legs PQ = 24 units and PR = 60 units, the hypotenuse QR can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. So QR = sqrt(PQ^2 + PR^2) = sqrt(24^2 + 60^2).Calculating that: 24 squared is 576, and 60 squared is 3600. Adding them together gives 576 + 3600 = 4176. So QR = sqrt(4176). Now, I need to simplify sqrt(4176).Let me factorize 4176. Dividing by 16 first, since 16 is a perfect square. 4176 divided by 16 is 261. So sqrt(4176) = sqrt(16 * 261) = 4 * sqrt(261). Now, let's factorize 261. 261 divided by 3 is 87, and 87 divided by 3 is 29. So 261 = 3 * 3 * 29, which is 3^2 * 29. Therefore, sqrt(261) = 3 * sqrt(29). Putting it all together, sqrt(4176) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(29) = 12 * sqrt(29).So the length of the hypotenuse QR is 12‚àö29 units. But wait, the problem asked for the length of hypotenuse PQ. That doesn't make sense because PQ is a leg, not the hypotenuse. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant QR? Or perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.The problem says: \\"Triangle PQR is a right triangle with legs PQ and PR. Points U and V are on legs PQ and PR, respectively so that PU:UQ = PV:VR = 1:3. If QU = 18 units, and RV = 45 units, what is the length of hypotenuse PQ? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\\"Hmm, it definitely says hypotenuse PQ. That must be a mistake because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle, which would be QR in this case. So perhaps the problem meant QR? Or maybe the triangle is labeled differently? Let me think.Alternatively, maybe the triangle is labeled such that the right angle is at Q instead of P. If that's the case, then the legs would be PQ and QR, and the hypotenuse would be PR. But the problem states that the legs are PQ and PR, so the right angle must be at P. Therefore, QR is the hypotenuse.Given that, I think it's safe to assume that the problem had a typo, and they meant QR instead of PQ. So the answer should be 12‚àö29 units for QR. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another interpretation.Wait, maybe the triangle is labeled differently. Maybe P is not the right angle. Let me consider that possibility. If the right angle is at Q, then the legs would be PQ and QR, and the hypotenuse would be PR. But the problem says legs PQ and PR, so the right angle must be at P. Therefore, QR is the hypotenuse.So, in conclusion, despite the problem stating \\"hypotenuse PQ,\\" which is incorrect, the correct hypotenuse is QR, and its length is 12‚àö29 units. Therefore, I think that's the answer they're looking for."},{"question":"Given the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, set A = {1, 3, 4, 5}, and set B = {5, 6}, find the complement of A cup B in U, denoted as (A cup B)^c.A: {1, 3, 4}B: {5, 6}C: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}D: {2}","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about sets, and I need to find the complement of the union of sets A and B in the universal set U. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of set operations.First, let's make sure I understand the given information:- The universal set U is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.- Set A is {1, 3, 4, 5}.- Set B is {5, 6}.And I need to find (A ‚à™ B)^c, which is the complement of the union of A and B in U. The complement of a set consists of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. So, first, I need to find A ‚à™ B, and then find all elements in U that are not in A ‚à™ B.Let me start by finding A ‚à™ B. The union of two sets includes all elements that are in either set A or set B or both. So, let's list out the elements of A and B:- A has elements: 1, 3, 4, 5.- B has elements: 5, 6.When I take the union, I combine these elements, making sure not to duplicate any. So, starting with A: 1, 3, 4, 5. Then adding the elements from B that aren't already in A: 6. So, A ‚à™ B should be {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}.Now, to find the complement of this union in U, which is (A ‚à™ B)^c. The complement consists of all elements in U that are not in A ‚à™ B.

Yep, that seems right.So, the complement of A ‚à™ B in U is {2}, which corresponds to option D.I think that's it. I didn't encounter any confusing parts this time, but it's always good to go through the steps carefully to avoid mistakes."},{"question":"Given that the function f(x) = (x-2)(ax+b) is an even function and is monotonically increasing on the interval (0, +infty), determine the solution set for f(2-x) > 0.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the solution set for ( f(2 - x) > 0 ) given that ( f(x) = (x - 2)(ax + b) ) is an even function and is monotonically increasing on the interval ( (0, +infty) ). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that an even function satisfies ( f(x) = f(-x) ) for all ( x ) in its domain. So, if I plug in ( -x ) into the function, it should give me the same result as ( f(x) ). Let me write that out:( f(-x) = (-x - 2)(a(-x) + b) )Simplifying that, I get:( f(-x) = (-x - 2)(-ax + b) )Now, since ( f(x) ) is even, this should be equal to ( f(x) ), which is ( (x - 2)(ax + b) ). So:( (x - 2)(ax + b) = (-x - 2)(-ax + b) )Let me expand both sides to see what this implies.Expanding the left side:( (x - 2)(ax + b) = ax^2 + bx - 2ax - 2b = ax^2 + (b - 2a)x - 2b )Expanding the right side:( (-x - 2)(-ax + b) = a x^2 - bx + 2ax - 2b = ax^2 + (2a - b)x - 2b )So, setting both expanded forms equal:( ax^2 + (b - 2a)x - 2b = ax^2 + (2a - b)x - 2b )Subtracting ( ax^2 - 2b ) from both sides:( (b - 2a)x = (2a - b)x )So, ( (b - 2a)x = (2a - b)x )Subtracting ( (2a - b)x ) from both sides:( (b - 2a - 2a + b)x = 0 )Simplifying:( (2b - 4a)x = 0 )Since this must hold for all ( x ), the coefficient must be zero:( 2b - 4a = 0 )Dividing both sides by 2:( b - 2a = 0 )So, ( b = 2a ). Okay, that's one condition.Now, the function is monotonically increasing on ( (0, +infty) ). Monotonically increasing means that the derivative is positive on that interval. Let me find the derivative of ( f(x) ).First, let's write ( f(x) ) with ( b = 2a ):( f(x) = (x - 2)(ax + 2a) = a(x - 2)(x + 2) = a(x^2 - 4) )So, ( f(x) = a x^2 - 4a )Taking the derivative:( f'(x) = 2a x )Since the function is monotonically increasing on ( (0, +infty) ), ( f'(x) > 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ). So:( 2a x > 0 ) for all ( x > 0 )Since ( x > 0 ), ( 2a x > 0 ) implies that ( a > 0 ). So, ( a ) must be positive.Alright, so now we know that ( a > 0 ) and ( b = 2a ). So, the function is ( f(x) = a x^2 - 4a ).Now, we need to find the solution set for ( f(2 - x) > 0 ). Let me compute ( f(2 - x) ):( f(2 - x) = a(2 - x)^2 - 4a )Let me expand ( (2 - x)^2 ):( (2 - x)^2 = 4 - 4x + x^2 )So, substituting back:( f(2 - x) = a(4 - 4x + x^2) - 4a = 4a - 4a x + a x^2 - 4a = a x^2 - 4a x )So, ( f(2 - x) = a x^2 - 4a x )We need to find where this is greater than zero:( a x^2 - 4a x > 0 )Since ( a > 0 ), we can factor it out:( a(x^2 - 4x) > 0 )Dividing both sides by ( a ) (which is positive, so inequality sign doesn't change):( x^2 - 4x > 0 )Let me factor this quadratic:( x(x - 4) > 0 )So, the product of ( x ) and ( x - 4 ) is positive. This happens when both factors are positive or both are negative.Case 1: Both ( x > 0 ) and ( x - 4 > 0 ). So, ( x > 4 ).Case 2: Both ( x < 0 ) and ( x - 4 < 0 ). So, ( x < 0 ).Therefore, the solution set is ( x < 0 ) or ( x > 4 ).Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I started by using the property of even functions, set ( f(x) = f(-x) ), expanded both sides, and found that ( b = 2a ). That seems correct.2. Then, I found the derivative of ( f(x) ) and determined that ( a > 0 ) for the function to be increasing on ( (0, +infty) ). That makes sense because the derivative is ( 2a x ), which is positive when ( a > 0 ) and ( x > 0 ).3. Next, I computed ( f(2 - x) ) by substituting ( 2 - x ) into the function, expanded it, and simplified to get ( a x^2 - 4a x ). That seems correct.4. Then, I set up the inequality ( a x^2 - 4a x > 0 ), factored out ( a ), and solved the resulting quadratic inequality ( x(x - 4) > 0 ), leading to ( x < 0 ) or ( x > 4 ). That seems right.I think all the steps are solid. So, the solution set is all real numbers less than 0 or greater than 4."},{"question":"What is the sum of all the integers between -20.5 and -1.5?","answer":"First, I need to determine the range of integers between -20.5 and -1.5.

Let me start by understanding what a syllogism is. From what I remember, a syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning that consists of two premises and a conclusion. The structure is usually like this: 1. Major premise: A general statement.2. Minor premise: A specific statement.3. Conclusion: Derived from the two premises.In this problem, there are three statements given:‚ë† The diagonals of a square are equal.‚ë° The diagonals of a rectangle are equal.‚ë¢ A square is a rectangle.I need to arrange these into a syllogism, identifying which is the major premise, minor premise, and conclusion. The options provided are A, B, C, and D, each suggesting a different order.First, let's recall what a syllogism requires. The major premise is a general rule or principle. The minor premise applies this general rule to a specific case, and the conclusion follows logically from both premises.Looking at the statements:- Statement ‚ë° says that the diagonals of a rectangle are equal. That seems like a general rule because rectangles are a broader category.- Statement ‚ë¢ states that a square is a rectangle. This is a specific statement because it's relating a specific shape (square) to a broader category (rectangle).- Statement ‚ë† claims that the diagonals of a square are equal. This would be the conclusion because it's a specific result derived from the general rule and the specific case.So, putting it together:1. Major premise: ‚ë° The diagonals of a rectangle are equal.2. Minor premise: ‚ë¢ A square is a rectangle.3. Conclusion: ‚ë† The diagonals of a square are equal.This seems logical because if all rectangles have equal diagonals and a square is a type of rectangle, then it follows that a square must also have equal diagonals.Let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up the premises. If I switch the major and minor premises, would that still make sense? If I take ‚ë¢ as the major premise and ‚ë° as the minor premise, it would look like:1. Major premise: ‚ë¢ A square is a rectangle.2. Minor premise: ‚ë° The diagonals of a rectangle are equal.3. Conclusion: ‚ë† The diagonals of a square are equal.Wait, that still seems to work because starting with the specific case and then applying the general rule still leads to the conclusion. But in traditional syllogism structure, the major premise is supposed to be the general statement, and the minor premise is the specific one. So, even though both orders might lead to the conclusion, the standard form requires the major premise to come first.Therefore, the correct order should be ‚ë° (major premise), ‚ë¢ (minor premise), and ‚ë† (conclusion). Looking back at the options:A: ‚ë°‚ë†‚ë¢ ‚Äì No, because ‚ë† is the conclusion, not the minor premise.B: ‚ë¢‚ë†‚ë° ‚Äì No, because ‚ë¢ is the minor premise, not the major.C: ‚ë†‚ë°‚ë¢ ‚Äì No, because ‚ë† is the conclusion, not the major premise.D: ‚ë°‚ë¢‚ë† ‚Äì Yes, this matches our reasoning.I think I've got it right. The major premise is the general rule about rectangles, the minor premise connects squares to rectangles, and the conclusion is about squares having equal diagonals."},{"question":"Given the function f(x+1)=dfrac{f(x)}{1+f(x)}, and f(1)=1, then f(10)= _________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x+1) = f(x)/(1 + f(x)), and I know that f(1) = 1. I need to find f(10). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, the function is defined recursively, meaning each value depends on the previous one. So, maybe I can compute f(2), f(3), and so on up to f(10) step by step. That sounds doable, especially since it's only up to 10.Let me start by writing down what I know:f(1) = 1.Now, using the recursive formula:f(2) = f(1 + 1) = f(1)/(1 + f(1)) = 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2.Alright, f(2) is 1/2. Next, f(3):f(3) = f(2 + 1) = f(2)/(1 + f(2)) = (1/2)/(1 + 1/2) = (1/2)/(3/2) = (1/2)*(2/3) = 1/3.Hmm, interesting. So f(3) is 1/3. Let me see if there's a pattern here. f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1/2, f(3) = 1/3. It seems like f(n) = 1/n? Let me test this with f(4):f(4) = f(3 + 1) = f(3)/(1 + f(3)) = (1/3)/(1 + 1/3) = (1/3)/(4/3) = (1/3)*(3/4) = 1/4.Yep, f(4) is 1/4. So it's definitely following f(n) = 1/n. Let me just verify one more to be sure:f(5) = f(4 + 1) = f(4)/(1 + f(4)) = (1/4)/(1 + 1/4) = (1/4)/(5/4) = (1/4)*(4/5) = 1/5.Alright, so the pattern holds. Therefore, it seems that f(n) = 1/n for each integer n starting from 1. So, if this pattern continues, f(10) should be 1/10.But just to be thorough, let me compute a few more terms:f(6) = f(5 + 1) = f(5)/(1 + f(5)) = (1/5)/(1 + 1/5) = (1/5)/(6/5) = 1/6.f(7) = f(6 + 1) = f(6)/(1 + f(6)) = (1/6)/(1 + 1/6) = (1/6)/(7/6) = 1/7.f(8) = f(7 + 1) = f(7)/(1 + f(7)) = (1/7)/(1 + 1/7) = (1/7)/(8/7) = 1/8.f(9) = f(8 + 1) = f(8)/(1 + f(8)) = (1/8)/(1 + 1/8) = (1/8)/(9/8) = 1/9.f(10) = f(9 + 1) = f(9)/(1 + f(9)) = (1/9)/(1 + 1/9) = (1/9)/(10/9) = 1/10.Okay, so computing each step confirms that f(n) = 1/n. Therefore, f(10) is indeed 1/10.I wonder if there's a more general way to see why f(n) = 1/n without computing each term. Maybe by solving the recurrence relation.The given recurrence is f(x+1) = f(x)/(1 + f(x)). Let me try to manipulate this equation to find a pattern or a closed-form solution.Let me take the reciprocal of both sides:1/f(x+1) = (1 + f(x))/f(x) = 1/f(x) + 1.So, 1/f(x+1) = 1/f(x) + 1.That's interesting. Let me denote g(x) = 1/f(x). Then the equation becomes:g(x+1) = g(x) + 1.This is a simple linear recurrence relation. The solution to this is g(x) = g(1) + (x - 1)*1, since each step increases g by 1.Given that f(1) = 1, so g(1) = 1/f(1) = 1/1 = 1.Therefore, g(x) = 1 + (x - 1) = x.So, g(x) = x, which means f(x) = 1/g(x) = 1/x.Hence, f(n) = 1/n for all positive integers n. Therefore, f(10) = 1/10.This confirms my earlier computation. So, whether I compute each term step by step or solve the recurrence relation by taking reciprocals, I arrive at the same conclusion.I think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key insight was to take the reciprocal of both sides, which simplified the recurrence into a straightforward linear relation. That made it much easier to find the general term.So, in summary, f(10) is 1/10.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(10) ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{10}}."},{"question":"Let {a_n} be an arithmetic sequence with the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n, where a_2 = 4 and S_5 = 30.

Find the sum of the first n terms of {d_n}, denoted by T_n.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem with three parts, all related to sequences. Let me try to tackle each part step by step. Starting with part ‚ë†: I need to find the general term formula for the arithmetic sequence {a_n}. They've given me that a_2 = 4 and S_5 = 30, where S_n is the sum of the first n terms. Okay, for an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference. The sum of the first n terms, S_n, is given by S_n = n/2 [2a_1 + (n-1)d]. Given that a_2 = 4, which is the second term, so that would be a_1 + d = 4. That's equation one. Also, S_5 = 30. Plugging into the sum formula: S_5 = 5/2 [2a_1 + 4d] = 30. Let me compute that: 5/2 [2a_1 + 4d] = 30. Multiply both sides by 2: 5[2a_1 + 4d] = 60. Divide both sides by 5: 2a_1 + 4d = 12. Simplify that: a_1 + 2d = 6. So now I have two equations:1. a_1 + d = 42. a_1 + 2d = 6Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (a_1 + 2d) - (a_1 + d) = 6 - 4 => d = 2. Then, plugging back into equation 1: a_1 + 2 = 4 => a_1 = 2. So the general term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = 2 + (n-1)*2 = 2 + 2n - 2 = 2n. So a_n = 2n. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check: a_2 should be 4, which is 2*2=4, correct. S_5 is the sum of first 5 terms: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30, which matches. Okay, part ‚ë† seems done.Moving on to part ‚ë°: They define another sequence {b_n} where b_1 = 0 and for n ‚â• 2, b_n = 2b_{n-1} + 1. I need to let C_n = b_n + 1 and prove that {C_n} is a geometric sequence, then find the general term for {b_n}.Hmm, okay. So C_n = b_n + 1. Let's see what the recursion becomes. Given that b_n = 2b_{n-1} + 1, so let's express C_n in terms of C_{n-1}:C_n = b_n + 1 = 2b_{n-1} + 1 + 1 = 2b_{n-1} + 2 = 2(b_{n-1} + 1) = 2C_{n-1}.So the recursion for C_n is C_n = 2C_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with common ratio 2. Now, what's C_1? Since C_n = b_n + 1, then C_1 = b_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Therefore, the general term for {C_n} is C_n = C_1 * 2^{n-1} = 1 * 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}. Hence, since C_n = b_n + 1, then b_n = C_n - 1 = 2^{n-1} - 1. Let me test this with the initial terms. For n=1: b_1 = 0, which is 2^{0} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, correct. For n=2: b_2 = 2b_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1, which is 2^{1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, correct. For n=3: b_3 = 2b_2 + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3, which is 2^{2} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3, correct. Seems good.Alright, part ‚ë° is done.Now part ‚ë¢: Define {d_n} such that d_n = 4/(a_n a_{n+1}) + b_n. I need to find the sum of the first n terms, T_n.First, let's write down what d_n is. From part ‚ë†, a_n = 2n, so a_{n+1} = 2(n+1). Therefore, 4/(a_n a_{n+1}) = 4/(2n * 2(n+1)) = 4/(4n(n+1)) = 1/(n(n+1)).So d_n = 1/(n(n+1)) + b_n. From part ‚ë°, b_n = 2^{n-1} - 1. So d_n = 1/(n(n+1)) + 2^{n-1} - 1.Therefore, T_n = sum_{k=1}^n d_k = sum_{k=1}^n [1/(k(k+1)) + 2^{k-1} - 1].Let me split this into three separate sums:T_n = sum_{k=1}^n [1/(k(k+1))] + sum_{k=1}^n [2^{k-1}] - sum_{k=1}^n [1].Compute each sum separately.First sum: sum_{k=1}^n [1/(k(k+1))]. This is a telescoping series. Recall that 1/(k(k+1)) = 1/k - 1/(k+1). So sum_{k=1}^n [1/k - 1/(k+1)] = (1 - 1/2) + (1/2 - 1/3) + ... + (1/n - 1/(n+1)) = 1 - 1/(n+1).Second sum: sum_{k=1}^n [2^{k-1}]. This is a geometric series with first term 2^{0}=1 and ratio 2. The sum is (2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^n - 1.Third sum: sum_{k=1}^n [1] = n.Putting it all together:T_n = [1 - 1/(n+1)] + [2^n - 1] - n.Simplify:1 - 1/(n+1) + 2^n - 1 - n = (1 - 1) + 2^n - n - 1/(n+1) = 2^n - n - 1/(n+1).So T_n = 2^n - n - 1/(n+1).Let me verify this with n=1: d_1 = 4/(a_1 a_2) + b_1 = 4/(2*4) + 0 = 4/8 + 0 = 0.5. So T_1 = 0.5. Plugging into the formula: 2^1 - 1 - 1/(1+1) = 2 - 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. Correct.For n=2: d_1 = 0.5, d_2 = 4/(4*6) + b_2 = 4/24 + 1 = 1/6 + 1 = 7/6. So T_2 = 0.5 + 7/6 = 1/2 + 7/6 = (3/6 + 7/6) = 10/6 = 5/3. Using the formula: 2^2 - 2 - 1/3 = 4 - 2 - 1/3 = 2 - 1/3 = 5/3. Correct.Another check for n=3: d_3 = 4/(6*8) + b_3 = 4/48 + 3 = 1/12 + 3 = 37/12. So T_3 = 5/3 + 37/12 = (20/12 + 37/12) = 57/12 = 19/4. Formula: 2^3 - 3 - 1/4 = 8 - 3 - 0.25 = 5 - 0.25 = 4.75 = 19/4. Correct.Looks like the formula works. So I think that's it.**Final Answer**‚ë† The general term is boxed{2n}.‚ë° The general term is boxed{2^{n-1} - 1}.‚ë¢ The sum of the first ( n ) terms is boxed{2^n - n - dfrac{1}{n+1}}."},{"question":"Given that the graph of a quadratic function intersects the x-axis at two points and the coordinates of the vertex are left(-2,1right). If the graph passes through the points (1,y_{1}), (-1,y_{2}), (-4,y_{3}), then y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3} are connected by \\"lt\\" as ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a quadratic function. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The graph of the quadratic intersects the x-axis at two points, which means it has two real roots. The vertex of this parabola is at (-2, 1). So, the vertex form of a quadratic function is usually written as y = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. In this case, h is -2 and k is 1, so the equation should be y = a(x + 2)^2 + 1.Now, the graph passes through three points: (1, y‚ÇÅ), (-1, y‚ÇÇ), and (-4, y‚ÇÉ). I need to figure out the relationship between y‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÇ, and y‚ÇÉ using the less than symbol. So, I need to determine which of these y-values is the smallest, which is in the middle, and which is the largest.Since the vertex is at (-2, 1), that's the highest or lowest point on the parabola. The problem says it intersects the x-axis at two points, so it must open either upwards or downwards. If it opens upwards, the vertex is the minimum point; if it opens downwards, the vertex is the maximum point. Since the vertex is at ( -2, 1) and it intersects the x-axis, which is below the vertex, it must open downwards. So, the vertex is the maximum point.That means as we move away from the vertex along the x-axis, the y-values decrease. So, points closer to x = -2 will have higher y-values, and points farther away will have lower y-values.Let me list the x-coordinates of the given points and their distances from the vertex's x-coordinate, which is -2.1. For the point (1, y‚ÇÅ), the x-coordinate is 1. The distance from -2 is |1 - (-2)| = |1 + 2| = 3 units.2. For the point (-1, y‚ÇÇ), the x-coordinate is -1. The distance from -2 is |-1 - (-2)| = |-1 + 2| = |1| = 1 unit.3. For the point (-4, y‚ÇÉ), the x-coordinate is -4. The distance from -2 is |-4 - (-2)| = |-4 + 2| = |-2| = 2 units.So, the distances from the vertex are:- y‚ÇÇ: 1 unit- y‚ÇÉ: 2 units- y‚ÇÅ: 3 unitsSince the parabola opens downward, the closer a point is to the vertex, the higher its y-value. Therefore, y‚ÇÇ is the highest, followed by y‚ÇÉ, and then y‚ÇÅ is the lowest.So, the order from smallest to largest y-values is y‚ÇÅ < y‚ÇÉ < y‚ÇÇ.I think that makes sense because as we move away from the vertex, the y-values decrease. So, the point farthest from the vertex should have the smallest y-value, and the point closest should have the largest y-value.Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The vertex is at (-2, 1), and the parabola opens downward. So, points closer to x = -2 should have higher y-values. The distances I calculated are correct: 1 unit, 2 units, and 3 units. Therefore, y‚ÇÇ is closest, so it's highest, y‚ÇÉ is next, and y‚ÇÅ is farthest, so it's lowest. Yeah, that seems right.I don't think I made any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was recognizing that the parabola opens downward because it has two x-intercepts and the vertex is above the x-axis. Then, using the distances from the vertex to determine the order of the y-values.**Final Answer**The relationship between ( y_1 ), ( y_2 ), and ( y_3 ) is boxed{y_1 < y_3 < y_2}."},{"question":"Given the proposition (p: forall x in mathbb{R}^+, ln x > 0), then the negation of (p) isA: (exists x in mathbb{R}^+, ln x > 0)B: (forall x in mathbb{R}^+, ln x leqslant 0)C: (exists x in mathbb{R}^+, ln x leqslant 0)D: (forall x in mathbb{R}^+, ln x < 0)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about negating a proposition. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.The proposition is p: For all x in the positive real numbers, the natural logarithm of x is greater than zero. So, symbolically, that's written as ‚àÄx ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x > 0. And the question is asking for the negation of p, with four options provided.Alright, so I need to figure out what the negation of this statement would be. I remember that in logic, the negation of a universal statement (\\"for all\\") is an existential statement (\\"there exists\\"). So, if the original statement is saying that something is true for every x in a set, the negation would be saying that there exists at least one x in that set for which the statement is false.Let me write down the original proposition again:p: ‚àÄx ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x > 0.So, the negation, ¬¨p, should be:¬¨p: ‚àÉx ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x ‚â§ 0.Wait, why did I change the inequality? Because the original statement says ln x is greater than zero, so the negation would be that ln x is not greater than zero, which means it's less than or equal to zero.Let me double-check that. If ln x > 0 is the original condition, then the negation would indeed be ln x ‚â§ 0. So, the negation is saying that there exists some positive real number x for which the natural logarithm of x is less than or equal to zero.Looking at the options provided:A: ‚àÉx ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x > 0.B: ‚àÄx ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x ‚â§ 0.C: ‚àÉx ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x ‚â§ 0.D: ‚àÄx ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x < 0.So, option C matches what I derived for ¬¨p. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.Option A is saying there exists an x where ln x is greater than zero. But that's actually compatible with the original statement p, which says that for all x, ln x is greater than zero. So, if p is true, then A would also be true, but the negation shouldn't be something that's compatible with p; it should contradict p. So, A is not the negation.Option B is saying that for all x in ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x is less than or equal to zero. That's a universal statement, which is stronger than just saying there exists an x where ln x is less than or equal to zero. The negation of a universal statement is an existential statement, not another universal statement. So, B is too strong and not the correct negation.Option C is saying there exists an x in ‚Ñù‚Å∫ where ln x is less than or equal to zero. That's exactly what I derived earlier, so this seems correct.Option D is saying that for all x in ‚Ñù‚Å∫, ln x is less than zero. Similar to option B, this is a universal statement, and it's even stronger because it excludes the possibility of ln x being equal to zero. Since the negation only needs to state that there's at least one x where ln x is not greater than zero, D is not necessary and is incorrect.Just to be thorough, let's think about what ln x actually is. The natural logarithm function, ln x, is zero when x is 1, positive when x is greater than 1, and negative when x is between 0 and 1. So, for x = 1, ln x = 0, which satisfies ln x ‚â§ 0. For x between 0 and 1, ln x is negative, which also satisfies ln x ‚â§ 0. Therefore, there definitely exists x in ‚Ñù‚Å∫ where ln x is less than or equal to zero, which means the negation is true in this case.But wait, the question is just about the form of the negation, not whether it's true or false. So, regardless of the actual truth value, the correct logical negation is option C.Let me recap:Original statement: For all positive real numbers x, ln x is greater than zero.Negation: There exists a positive real number x such that ln x is less than or equal to zero.Which matches option C.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning."},{"question":"p , q and r have  9000 among themselves . r has two - thirds of the total amount with p and q . find the amount with r ?","answer":"First, let's denote the total amount of money that P and Q have together as T.According to the problem, R has two-thirds of this total amount, so:R = (2/3)TThe total amount of money among P, Q, and R is 9000:P + Q + R = 9000Since P + Q = T, we can substitute:T + (2/3)T = 9000Combining the terms:(5/3)T = 9000Solving for T:T = 9000 * (3/5) = 5400Finally, calculating R:R = (2/3) * 5400 = 3600"},{"question":"The negation of the proposition \\"There exists an (x_0 in mathbb{R}) such that (x_0^3 - x_0^2 + 1 leqslant 0)\\" is (¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†)A: There exists an (x_0 in mathbb{R}), (x_0^3 - x_0^2 + 1 > 0 )B: For all (x in mathbb{R}), (x^3 - x^2 + 1 > 0 )C: For all (x notin mathbb{R}), (x^3 - x^2 + 1 > 0 )D: For all (x in mathbb{R}), (x^3 - x^2 + 1 leqslant 0 )","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about negating a proposition. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The original proposition is: \\"There exists an (x_0 in mathbb{R}) such that (x_0^3 - x_0^2 + 1 leqslant 0).\\" And I need to find its negation from the given options.First, I remember that in logic, the negation of an existential quantifier (\\"there exists\\") is a universal quantifier (\\"for all\\"). So, if the original statement is saying that there is at least one real number (x_0) that satisfies the inequality (x_0^3 - x_0^2 + 1 leqslant 0), then the negation should be that for all real numbers (x), this inequality does not hold. In other words, for every real number (x), (x^3 - x^2 + 1) is greater than 0.Let me write that down to make it clearer. The original statement is:[exists x_0 in mathbb{R}, quad x_0^3 - x_0^2 + 1 leqslant 0]The negation should then be:[forall x in mathbb{R}, quad x^3 - x^2 + 1 > 0]Looking at the options, option B matches this exactly. It says: \\"For all (x in mathbb{R}), (x^3 - x^2 + 1 > 0).\\" So, that seems to be the correct negation.But wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Sometimes, when dealing with negations, especially involving inequalities, it's easy to mix up the direction of the inequality or misapply the quantifiers.So, the original proposition is about the existence of at least one real number where the expression is less than or equal to zero. The negation would mean that such a number does not exist, which implies that for every real number, the expression is strictly greater than zero. That still points me to option B.Just to be thorough, let's look at the other options:- **Option A**: \\"There exists an (x_0 in mathbb{R}), (x_0^3 - x_0^2 + 1 > 0).\\" This is not the negation because it's still an existential statement, just with the inequality reversed. It doesn't negate the original statement; it's possible that both the original statement and option A are true if there are some (x) where the expression is less than or equal to zero and others where it's greater than zero.- **Option C**: \\"For all (x notin mathbb{R}), (x^3 - x^2 + 1 > 0).\\" This is talking about numbers not in the real numbers, which doesn't make sense in this context because the original proposition is about real numbers. So, this seems irrelevant.- **Option D**: \\"For all (x in mathbb{R}), (x^3 - x^2 + 1 leqslant 0).\\" This is the opposite of the original statement in a way, but it's not the correct negation because it's saying that the expression is always less than or equal to zero, which is too strong. The negation should only require that there doesn't exist any (x) where the expression is less than or equal to zero, not that it's always less than or equal to zero.So, after considering all options, option B is indeed the correct negation of the original proposition.Just to be extra careful, I might want to analyze the function (f(x) = x^3 - x^2 + 1) to see if my reasoning makes sense. If I can determine whether this function ever dips below or equals zero, it could help confirm if the original statement is true or not, but since the question is only about the negation, maybe that's unnecessary. However, for my own understanding, let's see.Looking at (f(x) = x^3 - x^2 + 1), it's a cubic function. Cubic functions generally have one real root and two complex roots or three real roots. Let me try to find its real roots by setting (f(x) = 0):[x^3 - x^2 + 1 = 0]This might be a bit tricky to solve directly, but I can try plugging in some values to see if there's a real solution.Let's try (x = -1):[(-1)^3 - (-1)^2 + 1 = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 neq 0]How about (x = 0):[0^3 - 0^2 + 1 = 1 neq 0](x = 1):[1^3 - 1^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 neq 0](x = 2):[8 - 4 + 1 = 5 neq 0]Hmm, none of these are zeros. Maybe I should check the behavior as (x) approaches positive and negative infinity.As (x to infty), (x^3) dominates, so (f(x) to infty).As (x to -infty), (x^3) dominates negatively, so (f(x) to -infty).Since it's a continuous function (all polynomials are continuous), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, since it goes from negative infinity to positive infinity, it must cross zero at least once. So, there is at least one real root, meaning the original proposition is true.But wait, this seems contradictory to my earlier conclusion that the negation is option B. If the original proposition is true, then its negation should be false. But if I think about the function, it does cross zero, so there exists an (x_0) where (f(x_0) leqslant 0). Therefore, the original statement is true, and its negation should be false.But if I consider option B: \\"For all (x in mathbb{R}), (x^3 - x^2 + 1 > 0).\\" This would mean the function is always positive, which contradicts the fact that it crosses zero. Therefore, option B is false, which makes sense because the original statement is true, so its negation should be false.Wait, but the question is just about the form of the negation, not about whether it's true or false. So, regardless of the truth value, the logical negation of the original statement is option B.So, to recap:Original statement: ‚àÉx ‚àà ‚Ñù, f(x) ‚â§ 0Negation: ‚àÄx ‚àà ‚Ñù, f(x) > 0Which is option B.Therefore, despite the function actually having a real root, making the original statement true, the logical negation is still option B.I think I've thought this through thoroughly. I considered the logical structure, checked the options, and even analyzed the function to ensure my reasoning was sound. It seems that option B is indeed the correct negation."},{"question":"What is the greatest two-digit multiple of 17?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out what the greatest two-digit multiple of 17 is. Hmm, let's see. First, I know that a multiple of a number is just that number multiplied by an integer. So, for 17, the multiples would be 17 times 1, 17 times 2, and so on.Since I'm looking for a two-digit number, I need to find the largest multiple of 17 that is still less than 100. That makes sense because once the multiple reaches 100 or more, it becomes a three-digit number, which is outside the range I'm interested in.Alright, let's start by listing some multiples of 17 to see where we land. 17 times 1 is 17. That's definitely a two-digit number. 17 times 2 is 34. Still two digits. 17 times 3 is 51. Okay, that's also two digits.17 times 4 is 68. Still within the two-digit range.17 times 5 is 85. Hmm, still two digits. Now, 17 times 6 is 102. Oh, wait, that's a three-digit number. So, 102 is too big because it's three digits.So, from this list, the multiples of 17 that are two-digit numbers are 17, 34, 51, 68, and 85. The next multiple after 85 is 102, which is too big. Therefore, the largest two-digit multiple of 17 is 85. Just to double-check, if I divide 85 by 17, I should get an integer. Let's see: 85 divided by 17 is 5. Yep, that's an integer, so 85 is indeed a multiple of 17.Also, if I add 17 to 85, I get 102, which confirms that the next multiple is beyond two digits. So, 85 is the correct answer."},{"question":"At a gathering, Ted's age is 20 years less than three times Sally's age. The sum of their ages is 76.

But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the triangle could help. Let's place triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let‚Äôs say A is at (0, 0), B is at (2, 0), and C is at (0, 2). That makes ABC a right triangle for simplicity.Now, let's assign points A‚ÇÅ, B‚ÇÅ, and C‚ÇÅ on the opposite sides. Let's say A‚ÇÅ is on BC. Since B is at (2, 0) and C is at (0, 2), the coordinates of A‚ÇÅ can be parameterized. Let's say A‚ÇÅ divides BC in the ratio t:(1-t), so A‚ÇÅ would be at (2(1-t), 2t) for some t between 0 and 1.Similarly, B‚ÇÅ is on AC. Since A is at (0, 0) and C is at (0, 2), B‚ÇÅ can be at (0, 2s) for some s between 0 and 1.C‚ÇÅ is on AB. Since A is at (0, 0) and B is at (2, 0), C‚ÇÅ can be at (2r, 0) for some r between 0 and 1.Now, let's find the midpoints M_A, M_B, and M_C.M_A is the midpoint of AA‚ÇÅ. A is at (0, 0), and A‚ÇÅ is at (2(1-t), 2t). So, M_A would be at ((0 + 2(1-t))/2, (0 + 2t)/2) = (1 - t, t).Similarly, M_B is the midpoint of BB‚ÇÅ. B is at (2, 0), and B‚ÇÅ is at (0, 2s). So, M_B would be at ((2 + 0)/2, (0 + 2s)/2) = (1, s).M_C is the midpoint of CC‚ÇÅ. C is at (0, 2), and C‚ÇÅ is at (2r, 0). So, M_C would be at ((0 + 2r)/2, (2 + 0)/2) = (r, 1).Now, we have the coordinates of the midpoints: M_A = (1 - t, t), M_B = (1, s), and M_C = (r, 1).The question is whether these three points can lie on a straight line. For three points to be collinear, the slope between any two pairs of points must be equal.Let's calculate the slopes between M_A and M_B, and between M_B and M_C.Slope between M_A and M_B: (s - t)/(1 - (1 - t)) = (s - t)/t.Slope between M_B and M_C: (1 - s)/(r - 1).For these slopes to be equal, we need:(s - t)/t = (1 - s)/(r - 1)Cross-multiplying:(s - t)(r - 1) = t(1 - s)Expanding the left side:s(r - 1) - t(r - 1) = t - tsSo,sr - s - tr + t = t - tsLet's collect like terms:sr - s - tr + t - t + ts = 0Simplify:sr - s - tr + ts = 0Factor terms:s(r - 1) + t(s - r) = 0Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach this.Alternatively, let's consider the area of the triangle formed by M_A, M_B, and M_C. If the area is zero, then the points are collinear.The area can be calculated using the determinant formula:Area = (1/2)| (x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)) |Plugging in the coordinates:x_A = 1 - t, y_A = tx_B = 1, y_B = sx_C = r, y_C = 1So,Area = (1/2)| ( (1 - t)(s - 1) + 1(1 - t) + r(t - s) ) |Simplify each term:First term: (1 - t)(s - 1) = (1 - t)s - (1 - t) = s - ts - 1 + tSecond term: 1(1 - t) = 1 - tThird term: r(t - s) = rt - rsCombine all terms:s - ts - 1 + t + 1 - t + rt - rsSimplify:s - ts - 1 + t + 1 - t + rt - rsThe -1 and +1 cancel out, the +t and -t cancel out.Left with:s - ts + rt - rsFactor:s(1 - t - r) + rtHmm, for the area to be zero, we need:s(1 - t - r) + rt = 0So,s(1 - t - r) = -rtWhich implies,s = (-rt)/(1 - t - r)But s, r, t are all between 0 and 1, so the denominator 1 - t - r must be negative because the numerator is negative (since r and t are positive). Therefore,1 - t - r < 0 => t + r > 1So, s must be positive, and the equation becomes:s = (rt)/(t + r - 1)Since s must be between 0 and 1, let's see if this is possible.Given that t and r are between 0 and 1, and t + r > 1, then t + r - 1 is between 0 and 1.So, s = (rt)/(t + r - 1)Since rt is between 0 and 1, and t + r - 1 is between 0 and 1, s will be greater than or equal to rt, which is between 0 and 1.But we need to ensure that s is also between 0 and 1.Given that t + r > 1, and t, r < 1, let's pick some values to test.Let‚Äôs say t = 0.6 and r = 0.6. Then t + r = 1.2 > 1.So, s = (0.6 * 0.6)/(0.6 + 0.6 - 1) = 0.36 / 0.2 = 1.8But s = 1.8 is greater than 1, which is not allowed because s must be between 0 and 1.Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe t and r need to be closer to 1.Let‚Äôs try t = 0.8 and r = 0.8. Then t + r = 1.6 > 1.s = (0.8 * 0.8)/(0.8 + 0.8 - 1) = 0.64 / 0.6 ‚âà 1.066...Still greater than 1. Not allowed.What if t = 0.7 and r = 0.6? Then t + r = 1.3 > 1.s = (0.7 * 0.6)/(0.7 + 0.6 - 1) = 0.42 / 0.3 = 1.4Still greater than 1.Hmm, seems like s is always greater than 1 in these cases. Maybe I need to pick t and r such that t + r is just slightly greater than 1.Let‚Äôs try t = 0.51 and r = 0.51. Then t + r = 1.02 > 1.s = (0.51 * 0.51)/(0.51 + 0.51 - 1) = 0.2601 / 0.02 = 13.005That's way greater than 1. Not good.Wait, maybe t and r need to be less than 1 but such that t + r is just over 1, but then s becomes very large, which is not possible.Alternatively, maybe t and r are such that t + r - 1 is very small, making s very large, which is not allowed.So, it seems that s would have to be greater than 1 to satisfy the equation, but s must be less than or equal to 1.Therefore, there are no values of t and r between 0 and 1 such that s is also between 0 and 1 and the area is zero.Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me double-check.Area = (1/2)| ( (1 - t)(s - 1) + 1(1 - t) + r(t - s) ) |Expanding:(1 - t)(s - 1) = (1 - t)s - (1 - t) = s - ts - 1 + t1(1 - t) = 1 - tr(t - s) = rt - rsAdding them up:s - ts - 1 + t + 1 - t + rt - rsSimplify:s - ts + rt - rsFactor:s(1 - t - r) + rtYes, that seems correct.So, s(1 - t - r) + rt = 0Which leads to s = rt / (t + r - 1)Given that t + r > 1, denominator is positive, numerator is positive, so s is positive.But as we saw, s tends to be greater than 1, which is not allowed.Therefore, it seems that it's impossible for the midpoints M_A, M_B, and M_C to be collinear because it would require s > 1, which is not possible.Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there's a special case where t and r are chosen such that s is exactly 1.Let‚Äôs see. If s = 1, then:From s = rt / (t + r - 1) = 1So,rt = t + r - 1Rearranging:rt - t - r + 1 = 0Factor:(t - 1)(r - 1) = 0So, either t = 1 or r = 1.But t and r are between 0 and 1, not including 1 because the points are not at the vertices.So, t = 1 or r = 1 would place A‚ÇÅ at B or C, or C‚ÇÅ at B or A, which is not allowed as per the problem statement.Therefore, s cannot be 1 either.Hence, it's impossible for the midpoints to be collinear.Wait, but I might be overcomplicating this with coordinates. Maybe there's a simpler geometric argument.I recall that in a triangle, the midpoints of certain segments can lie on a straight line under specific conditions, like the Newton-Gauss line in a complete quadrilateral. But in this case, we're dealing with midpoints of cevians.Wait, cevians are lines from a vertex to the opposite side. So, AA‚ÇÅ, BB‚ÇÅ, CC‚ÇÅ are cevians.There's a theorem called the Midline Theorem or something related to midpoints of cevians.Alternatively, maybe using vectors could help.Let me try vector approach.Let‚Äôs assign vectors to the points. Let‚Äôs set point A as the origin, so A = (0, 0). Let‚Äôs denote vectors AB as vector b and AC as vector c.Then, point B is at vector b, point C is at vector c.Point A‚ÇÅ is on BC. Let's parameterize A‚ÇÅ as A‚ÇÅ = B + k(C - B) = (1 - k)B + kC, where k is between 0 and 1.Similarly, point B‚ÇÅ is on AC. Let's say B‚ÇÅ = A + m(C - A) = mC, where m is between 0 and 1.Point C‚ÇÅ is on AB. Let's say C‚ÇÅ = A + n(B - A) = nB, where n is between 0 and 1.Now, the midpoints:M_A is the midpoint of AA‚ÇÅ. Since A is at 0, M_A = (0 + A‚ÇÅ)/2 = A‚ÇÅ/2 = [(1 - k)B + kC]/2.Similarly, M_B is the midpoint of BB‚ÇÅ. B is at vector b, B‚ÇÅ is at mC. So, M_B = (B + B‚ÇÅ)/2 = (B + mC)/2.M_C is the midpoint of CC‚ÇÅ. C is at vector c, C‚ÇÅ is at nB. So, M_C = (C + C‚ÇÅ)/2 = (C + nB)/2.Now, we need to check if M_A, M_B, M_C are collinear.In vector terms, three points are collinear if the vectors formed between them are scalar multiples of each other.So, let's consider vectors M_B - M_A and M_C - M_A.Compute M_B - M_A:M_B - M_A = [(B + mC)/2] - [(1 - k)B + kC)/2] = [B + mC - (1 - k)B - kC]/2 = [B(1 - (1 - k)) + C(m - k)]/2 = [kB + (m - k)C]/2.Similarly, compute M_C - M_A:M_C - M_A = [(C + nB)/2] - [(1 - k)B + kC)/2] = [C + nB - (1 - k)B - kC]/2 = [B(n - (1 - k)) + C(1 - k)]/2 = [B(n + k - 1) + C(1 - k)]/2.For M_A, M_B, M_C to be collinear, the vectors M_B - M_A and M_C - M_A must be scalar multiples. That is, there exists a scalar Œª such that:[kB + (m - k)C]/2 = Œª [B(n + k - 1) + C(1 - k)]/2Simplify by multiplying both sides by 2:kB + (m - k)C = Œª [B(n + k - 1) + C(1 - k)]Equate coefficients:For B: k = Œª(n + k - 1)For C: m - k = Œª(1 - k)So, we have two equations:1) k = Œª(n + k - 1)2) m - k = Œª(1 - k)From equation 1, solve for Œª:Œª = k / (n + k - 1)From equation 2, solve for Œª:Œª = (m - k) / (1 - k)Set them equal:k / (n + k - 1) = (m - k) / (1 - k)Cross-multiplying:k(1 - k) = (m - k)(n + k - 1)Expand both sides:Left side: k - k¬≤Right side: (m - k)(n + k - 1) = m(n + k - 1) - k(n + k - 1) = mn + mk - m - kn - k¬≤ + kSo, we have:k - k¬≤ = mn + mk - m - kn - k¬≤ + kSimplify both sides:Left side: k - k¬≤Right side: mn + mk - m - kn - k¬≤ + kSubtract left side from both sides:0 = mn + mk - m - kn - k¬≤ + k - (k - k¬≤)Simplify:0 = mn + mk - m - kn - k¬≤ + k - k + k¬≤Simplify further:0 = mn + mk - m - knFactor:0 = m(n + k - 1) - knSo,m(n + k - 1) = knTherefore,m = kn / (n + k - 1)Now, since m, n, k are all between 0 and 1, let's see if this is possible.Given that n + k - 1 must be positive because m is positive.So,n + k - 1 > 0 => n + k > 1Thus, m = kn / (n + k - 1)Since n and k are between 0 and 1, and n + k > 1, the denominator n + k - 1 is between 0 and 1.Therefore, m = kn / (n + k - 1) is greater than kn, which is between 0 and 1.But m must be less than or equal to 1.So, we need:kn / (n + k - 1) ‚â§ 1Which implies:kn ‚â§ n + k - 1Rearranging:kn - n - k + 1 ‚â§ 0Factor:(n - 1)(k - 1) ‚â§ 0Since n < 1 and k < 1, (n - 1) and (k - 1) are both negative, so their product is positive.Thus,(n - 1)(k - 1) > 0Which contradicts the inequality kn - n - k + 1 ‚â§ 0.Therefore, our assumption leads to a contradiction, meaning that m cannot satisfy the condition m = kn / (n + k - 1) while keeping m ‚â§ 1.Hence, it's impossible for the midpoints M_A, M_B, and M_C to be collinear.Wait, but I'm not sure if I did the vector approach correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.Let me double-check the vector calculations.We had:M_B - M_A = [kB + (m - k)C]/2M_C - M_A = [B(n + k - 1) + C(1 - k)]/2Setting M_B - M_A = Œª(M_C - M_A):kB + (m - k)C = Œª [B(n + k - 1) + C(1 - k)]Which gives:k = Œª(n + k - 1)m - k = Œª(1 - k)Solving for Œª:Œª = k / (n + k - 1) = (m - k) / (1 - k)Cross-multiplying:k(1 - k) = (m - k)(n + k - 1)Expanding:k - k¬≤ = mn + mk - m - kn - k¬≤ + kSimplify:k - k¬≤ = mn + mk - m - kn - k¬≤ + kSubtract k - k¬≤ from both sides:0 = mn + mk - m - knWhich is:mn + mk - m - kn = 0Factor:m(n + k - 1) - kn = 0Thus,m(n + k - 1) = knSo,m = kn / (n + k - 1)As before.Given that n + k > 1, denominator is positive, so m is positive.But m must be ‚â§ 1, so:kn / (n + k - 1) ‚â§ 1Which implies:kn ‚â§ n + k - 1Rearranged:kn - n - k + 1 ‚â§ 0Factor:(n - 1)(k - 1) ‚â§ 0Since n < 1 and k < 1, (n - 1) < 0 and (k - 1) < 0, so their product is positive.Thus,(n - 1)(k - 1) > 0Which contradicts the inequality.Therefore, no solution exists where m ‚â§ 1.Hence, the midpoints cannot be collinear.I think this confirms that it's impossible for the midpoints to lie on a straight line."},{"question":"Given two vectors overrightarrow {a} = (2, x+1) and overrightarrow {b} = (x+2, 6), and knowing that the angle between overrightarrow {a} and overrightarrow {b} is acute, the range of the real number x is ( ).A: {x mid x > -frac{5}{4} text{ and } x neq 2}B: {x mid x > -frac{5}{4}}C: {x mid x < -frac{5}{4} text{ and } x neq -5}D: {x mid x < -frac{5}{4}}","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here with two vectors, a and b. Vector a is (2, x+1) and vector b is (x+2, 6). The question says that the angle between them is acute, and I need to find the range of the real number x. The options are A, B, C, D, which are different sets of x values.First, I remember that if the angle between two vectors is acute, their dot product should be positive. That makes sense because the cosine of an acute angle is positive, and the dot product formula involves cosine. So, I need to calculate the dot product of vectors a and b and set it greater than zero.Let me write that down. The dot product of a and b is:a ¬∑ b = (2)(x+2) + (x+1)(6)Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 2 by (x+2):2*(x+2) = 2x + 4Then, multiply (x+1) by 6:(x+1)*6 = 6x + 6Now, add those two results together:2x + 4 + 6x + 6 = (2x + 6x) + (4 + 6) = 8x + 10So, the dot product is 8x + 10. Since the angle is acute, this must be greater than zero:8x + 10 > 0Let me solve for x:8x > -10x > -10/8Simplify that fraction:x > -5/4Okay, so x has to be greater than -5/4. That gives me the first condition.But wait, I also remember that vectors can't be zero vectors, and they shouldn't be pointing in exactly opposite directions, but since the angle is acute, they just need to have a positive dot product. However, I also need to make sure that the vectors aren't collinear because if they are collinear, the angle would be either 0 degrees or 180 degrees, which are not acute. Wait, actually, 0 degrees is technically an acute angle, but in some contexts, people might consider the angle strictly between 0 and 90 degrees, not including 0. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should check.But to be safe, I think the problem just wants the angle to be acute, which is between 0 and 90 degrees, not including 0 or 180. So, to ensure that the vectors aren't collinear, their cross product shouldn't be zero. Wait, in two dimensions, the cross product isn't defined, but there's a determinant that can tell us if they're collinear.Right, in two dimensions, vectors are collinear if one is a scalar multiple of the other. So, for vectors a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2), they are collinear if a1*b2 = a2*b1.So, let me set up that condition:2*6 = (x+1)*(x+2)Compute the left side:2*6 = 12Compute the right side:(x+1)*(x+2) = x^2 + 3x + 2So, set them equal:x^2 + 3x + 2 = 12Subtract 12 from both sides:x^2 + 3x + 2 - 12 = 0Simplify:x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0Now, let's solve this quadratic equation. I can try factoring it.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -10 and add to 3. Hmm, 5 and -2.Yes, because 5*(-2) = -10 and 5 + (-2) = 3.So, the factors are (x + 5)(x - 2) = 0Therefore, the solutions are x = -5 and x = 2.So, when x is -5 or 2, the vectors are collinear. Since we don't want them to be collinear, we need to exclude these values from our solution set.So, combining both conditions:From the dot product, we have x > -5/4.From the collinearity, we have x ‚â† -5 and x ‚â† 2.But wait, x > -5/4 already excludes x = -5 because -5 is less than -5/4. So, we only need to exclude x = 2.Therefore, the range of x is all real numbers greater than -5/4, except x = 2.Looking back at the options:A: {x | x > -5/4 and x ‚â† 2}B: {x | x > -5/4}C: {x | x < -5/4 and x ‚â† -5}D: {x | x < -5/4}So, the correct answer should be A, because it includes x > -5/4 but excludes x = 2.Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning. If x = 2, the vectors are collinear, which would make the angle either 0 or 180 degrees. Since 0 degrees is technically an acute angle, but I think in the context of this problem, they want the angle to be strictly between 0 and 90 degrees, so we should exclude x = 2.Similarly, x = -5 would make the vectors collinear, but x = -5 is already less than -5/4, so it's not in our solution set. So, we only need to exclude x = 2.Therefore, the range is x > -5/4 and x ‚â† 2, which is option A.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The dot product gives x > -5/4, and the collinearity condition excludes x = 2. So, the answer should be A."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, sin A = 2cos Bsin C, then the triangle is","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here: In triangle ABC, it's given that sin A equals 2 times cos B times sin C. I need to figure out what kind of triangle ABC is based on this condition. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees, or œÄ radians. So, A + B + C = œÄ. That might come in handy later. Also, I recall the Law of Sines, which states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. So, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. Maybe that can help relate the sides and angles.But the equation given is sin A = 2 cos B sin C. I need to manipulate this equation to see if I can find a relationship between the angles or sides that would indicate the type of triangle. Let me write down the equation again:sin A = 2 cos B sin C.Hmm, I wonder if I can express sin A in terms of angles B and C since I know that A = œÄ - B - C. So, sin A = sin(œÄ - B - C). I also remember that sin(œÄ - x) = sin x, so sin(œÄ - B - C) = sin(B + C). So, sin A = sin(B + C).Wait, so sin(B + C) = 2 cos B sin C. Let me write that down:sin(B + C) = 2 cos B sin C.Now, I can expand sin(B + C) using the sine addition formula: sin(B + C) = sin B cos C + cos B sin C. So, substituting that in:sin B cos C + cos B sin C = 2 cos B sin C.Hmm, let's subtract cos B sin C from both sides to simplify:sin B cos C = cos B sin C.Okay, so sin B cos C = cos B sin C. Maybe I can rearrange this equation to get all terms on one side:sin B cos C - cos B sin C = 0.Wait a second, that looks familiar. Isn't that the sine of (B - C)? Because sin(B - C) = sin B cos C - cos B sin C. So, sin(B - C) = 0.If sin(B - C) = 0, then B - C must be an integer multiple of œÄ. But since B and C are angles in a triangle, they must each be between 0 and œÄ, and their sum must be less than œÄ because A is also positive. So, the only possibility is that B - C = 0, which means B = C.So, if B = C, then triangle ABC has two equal angles, which means it's an isosceles triangle with sides opposite those angles equal. Therefore, triangle ABC is isosceles.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from sin A = 2 cos B sin C, I used the identity sin A = sin(B + C) because A = œÄ - B - C. Then, expanding sin(B + C) gave me sin B cos C + cos B sin C, which I set equal to 2 cos B sin C. Subtracting cos B sin C from both sides left me with sin B cos C = cos B sin C, which I recognized as sin(B - C) = 0. Since B and C are angles in a triangle, the only solution is B = C, making the triangle isosceles.Yeah, that seems solid. I don't think I made any errors in the trigonometric identities or the logic. So, I'm confident that triangle ABC is isosceles."},{"question":"The four complex roots of[2z^4 + 8iz^3 + (-9 + 9i)z^2 + (-18 - 2i)z + (3 - 12i) = 0,]when plotted in the complex plane, form a rhombus.  Find the area of the rhombus.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of a rhombus formed by the four complex roots of a quartic equation. The equation is:[2z^4 + 8iz^3 + (-9 + 9i)z^2 + (-18 - 2i)z + (3 - 12i) = 0]First, I remember that complex roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs, but here the coefficients are complex, so that might not apply. However, the problem states that the roots form a rhombus when plotted in the complex plane. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel. The area of a rhombus can be calculated if we know the lengths of its diagonals, using the formula:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times d_1 times d_2]where (d_1) and (d_2) are the lengths of the diagonals.But I don't know the diagonals yet. Maybe I can find the roots and then plot them to find the diagonals? That seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way using properties of polynomials and complex numbers.I recall Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a quartic equation (az^4 + bz^3 + cz^2 + dz + e = 0), the sum of the roots is (-b/a), the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is (c/a), the sum of the products three at a time is (-d/a), and the product of all roots is (e/a).Let me write down the coefficients:- (a = 2)- (b = 8i)- (c = -9 + 9i)- (d = -18 - 2i)- (e = 3 - 12i)So, the sum of the roots is:[-b/a = -8i/2 = -4i]That means the average of the roots is (-4i/4 = -i). So, the center of the rhombus is at (-i) in the complex plane. That makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the center is the midpoint of both diagonals.Now, if I can find the distances from the center to each root, those would be half the lengths of the diagonals. Let me denote the roots as (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4). Then, each root can be written as:(z_k = -i + w_k), where (w_k) is a complex number representing the displacement from the center.Since the roots form a rhombus, the distances from the center to each root should be equal in pairs. That is, two roots will be at a distance (p) from the center, and the other two at a distance (q). The diagonals of the rhombus will then be (2p) and (2q), so the area will be:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 2p times 2q = 2pq]So, I need to find (p) and (q). How can I do that?I remember that if (z = -i + w), then (w = z + i). So, substituting (z = -i + w) into the original equation should give me a new polynomial in terms of (w). The roots of this new polynomial will be (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4), which are the displacements from the center.Let me perform this substitution step by step.Let (z = -i + w). Then:(z = -i + w)(z^2 = (-i + w)^2 = (-i)^2 + 2(-i)(w) + w^2 = -1 - 2iw + w^2)(z^3 = (-i + w)^3 = (-i)^3 + 3(-i)^2(w) + 3(-i)(w)^2 + w^3 = i + 3w + 3iw^2 + w^3)(z^4 = (-i + w)^4 = (-i)^4 + 4(-i)^3(w) + 6(-i)^2(w)^2 + 4(-i)(w)^3 + w^4 = 1 - 4iw - 6w^2 + 4iw^3 + w^4)Now, substitute these into the original equation:[2z^4 + 8iz^3 + (-9 + 9i)z^2 + (-18 - 2i)z + (3 - 12i) = 0]Substituting each term:1. (2z^4 = 2(1 - 4iw - 6w^2 + 4iw^3 + w^4) = 2 - 8iw - 12w^2 + 8iw^3 + 2w^4)2. (8iz^3 = 8i(i + 3w + 3iw^2 + w^3) = 8i^2 + 24iw + 24i^2w^2 + 8iw^3 = -8 + 24iw - 24w^2 + 8iw^3)3. ((-9 + 9i)z^2 = (-9 + 9i)(-1 - 2iw + w^2) = (-9)(-1) + (-9)(-2iw) + (-9)(w^2) + 9i(-1) + 9i(-2iw) + 9i(w^2))   Let's compute each part:   - (-9 times -1 = 9)   - (-9 times -2iw = 18iw)   - (-9 times w^2 = -9w^2)   - (9i times -1 = -9i)   - (9i times -2iw = -18i^2w = 18w) (since (i^2 = -1))   - (9i times w^2 = 9iw^2)   So, combining all:   (9 + 18iw - 9w^2 - 9i + 18w + 9iw^2)4. ((-18 - 2i)z = (-18 - 2i)(-i + w) = (-18)(-i) + (-18)(w) + (-2i)(-i) + (-2i)(w))   Compute each part:   - (-18 times -i = 18i)   - (-18 times w = -18w)   - (-2i times -i = 2i^2 = -2)   - (-2i times w = -2iw)   So, combining:   (18i - 18w - 2 - 2iw)5. The constant term is (3 - 12i).Now, let's combine all these terms:1. (2 - 8iw - 12w^2 + 8iw^3 + 2w^4)2. (-8 + 24iw - 24w^2 + 8iw^3)3. (9 + 18iw - 9w^2 - 9i + 18w + 9iw^2)4. (18i - 18w - 2 - 2iw)5. (3 - 12i)Let's add them term by term.First, constants:2 (from term1) -8 (term2) +9 (term3) -2 (term4) +3 (term5) = 2 -8 +9 -2 +3 = 4Next, terms with (w):-8iw (term1) +24iw (term2) +18iw (term3) -18w (term4) -2iw (term4)Wait, hold on. Term4 has both (w) and (iw) terms. Let me separate them.From term4: (18i - 18w - 2 - 2iw)So, in term4, the (w) term is -18w, and the (iw) term is -2iw.So, combining all (w) terms:-8iw (term1) +24iw (term2) +18iw (term3) -2iw (term4) = (-8 +24 +18 -2)iw = 32iwAnd the linear (w) term:-18w (term4)So, total linear terms: 32iw -18wNext, terms with (w^2):-12w^2 (term1) -24w^2 (term2) -9w^2 (term3) +9iw^2 (term3)So, combining:-12w^2 -24w^2 -9w^2 +9iw^2 = (-45w^2) +9iw^2Terms with (w^3):8iw^3 (term1) +8iw^3 (term2) +9iw^2 (term3) -2iw (term4)Wait, term3 has (iw^2), which is (w^2), not (w^3). So, only term1 and term2 have (w^3):8iw^3 +8iw^3 = 16iw^3Terms with (w^4):2w^4 (term1)Constant terms involving (i):From term3: -9iFrom term4: 18iFrom term5: -12iSo, combining:-9i +18i -12i = (-9 +18 -12)i = (-3)iPutting it all together:Constant term: 4Linear terms: 32iw -18wQuadratic terms: -45w^2 +9iw^2Cubic terms: 16iw^3Quartic term: 2w^4And the imaginary constants: -3iSo, the entire equation becomes:2w^4 +16iw^3 + (-45 +9i)w^2 + (32i -18)w + (4 -3i) = 0Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in combining the terms. Let me double-check.Wait, in term3, the (w^2) term is -9w^2 +9iw^2, which is (-9 +9i)w^2.In term1, the (w^2) term is -12w^2.In term2, the (w^2) term is -24w^2.So, total (w^2) terms: (-12 -24 -9 +9i)w^2 = (-45 +9i)w^2. That seems correct.Similarly, for (w^3): term1 has 8iw^3, term2 has 8iw^3, so total 16iw^3.For (w^4): term1 has 2w^4.For linear terms: term1 has -8iw, term2 has 24iw, term3 has 18iw, term4 has -2iw and -18w.So, combining the (iw) terms: (-8 +24 +18 -2)iw = 32iwAnd the (w) term: -18wSo, linear terms: 32iw -18wConstants: term1: 2, term2: -8, term3:9, term4: -2, term5:3. So 2 -8 +9 -2 +3 = 4Imaginary constants: term3: -9i, term4:18i, term5: -12i. So, -9i +18i -12i = -3iSo, the equation is:2w^4 +16iw^3 + (-45 +9i)w^2 + (32i -18)w + (4 -3i) = 0Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I can factor this polynomial or find some symmetry.Alternatively, since the roots form a rhombus, which is symmetric with respect to the center, the polynomial in (w) should have some symmetry. Specifically, if (w) is a root, then (-w) should also be a root, but rotated or something?Wait, no. In a rhombus, the points are symmetric with respect to the center, so if (w) is a displacement from the center, then (-w) should also be a displacement. But in a rhombus, the roots come in pairs symmetric about the center, but not necessarily negatives. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, so the roots should come in pairs such that (w) and (-w) are roots, but maybe rotated by 90 degrees or something.Alternatively, perhaps the polynomial in (w) can be factored into quadratics with real coefficients or something.Wait, let me think differently. Since the original polynomial is quartic, and we've shifted it by the center, maybe the new polynomial has some symmetry.Alternatively, perhaps the product of the roots (w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4) is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, which is ((4 -3i)/2). But that might not directly help.Wait, but if the roots form a rhombus centered at the origin in the (w)-plane, then the product of the roots (w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4) is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, which is ((4 -3i)/2). But I'm not sure how that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a rhombus, the product of the distances from the center to each pair of opposite vertices is equal. So, if two roots are at distance (p) and the other two at distance (q), then (p times q) would relate to the area.Wait, earlier I thought the area is (2pq), but actually, the area of a rhombus is (frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2), where (d_1) and (d_2) are the lengths of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are (2p) and (2q), the area would be (frac{1}{2} times 2p times 2q = 2pq). So, yes, area is (2pq).So, if I can find (p) and (q), I can find the area.But how?I recall that for a polynomial, the product of the roots is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. In the (w)-polynomial, the product of the roots is ((4 -3i)/2). But the roots are (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4), which are the displacements from the center. So, (w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 = (4 -3i)/2).But in a rhombus, the roots come in pairs such that (w_1 = -w_3) and (w_2 = -w_4), or something like that? Wait, no, because in a rhombus, the opposite vertices are symmetric with respect to the center, so (w_3 = -w_1) and (w_4 = -w_2). So, the product (w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 = w_1 w_2 (-w_1)(-w_2) = w_1^2 w_2^2).So, (w_1^2 w_2^2 = (4 -3i)/2). Therefore, (|w_1|^2 |w_2|^2 = |(4 -3i)/2| = sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}/2 = 5/2).So, (|w_1|^2 |w_2|^2 = 5/2). Therefore, (|w_1| |w_2| = sqrt{5/2}).But (|w_1| = p) and (|w_2| = q), so (pq = sqrt{5/2}). Therefore, the area is (2pq = 2 times sqrt{5/2} = sqrt{10}).Wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I miss something?Let me recap:1. The original polynomial has roots forming a rhombus centered at (-i).2. By substituting (z = -i + w), we shift the center to the origin in the (w)-plane.3. The new polynomial in (w) has roots (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4), which are the displacements from the center.4. In a rhombus, opposite roots are negatives of each other, so (w_3 = -w_1) and (w_4 = -w_2).5. Therefore, the product of all roots (w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 = w_1^2 w_2^2).6. The product of the roots is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, which is ((4 -3i)/2).7. Taking the magnitude, (|w_1^2 w_2^2| = |(4 -3i)/2| = 5/2).8. Therefore, (|w_1|^2 |w_2|^2 = 5/2), so (|w_1| |w_2| = sqrt{5/2}).9. The area of the rhombus is (2pq = 2 times sqrt{5/2} = sqrt{10}).Yes, that seems correct. So, the area is (sqrt{10}).I think that's the answer."},{"question":"Given that the function y=f(x) is a monotonically increasing function defined on mathbb{R}, and 1 is its zero, if f(x^{2}+3x-3) < 0, then the range of values for the real number x is _____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: there's a function y = f(x) that's monotonically increasing on all real numbers, and it has a zero at x = 1. That means when x is 1, f(1) = 0. The question is asking, if f(x¬≤ + 3x - 3) is less than zero, what are the possible values of x?Alright, let me break this down. First, since f is monotonically increasing, that tells me that as x increases, f(x) also increases. So, if I have two points, say a and b, where a < b, then f(a) < f(b). That's the definition of a monotonically increasing function.Now, since 1 is a zero of the function, f(1) = 0. So, for values of x less than 1, since the function is increasing, f(x) must be less than zero. And for values of x greater than 1, f(x) must be greater than zero. That makes sense.So, the inequality given is f(x¬≤ + 3x - 3) < 0. Since f is increasing, f(some expression) < 0 implies that the expression itself must be less than 1, right? Because f(1) = 0, and anything less than 1 will give a value less than zero.So, I can set up the inequality: x¬≤ + 3x - 3 < 1. Let me write that down:x¬≤ + 3x - 3 < 1Now, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. Let me subtract 1 from both sides to get:x¬≤ + 3x - 4 < 0Alright, so now I have x¬≤ + 3x - 4 < 0. To solve this, I should factor the quadratic if possible. Let me see if I can factor it.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1. Because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. Perfect.So, factoring the quadratic:(x + 4)(x - 1) < 0Okay, so now I have the product of (x + 4) and (x - 1) being less than zero. To find where this product is negative, I can use a sign chart or test intervals.First, find the critical points where each factor is zero:x + 4 = 0 => x = -4x - 1 = 0 => x = 1These points divide the real number line into three intervals:1. x < -42. -4 < x < 13. x > 1Now, I'll test each interval to see the sign of the product (x + 4)(x - 1) in each interval.1. For x < -4, let's pick x = -5:   (-5 + 4) = -1   (-5 - 1) = -6   Product: (-1)*(-6) = 6, which is positive.2. For -4 < x < 1, let's pick x = 0:   (0 + 4) = 4   (0 - 1) = -1   Product: 4*(-1) = -4, which is negative.3. For x > 1, let's pick x = 2:   (2 + 4) = 6   (2 - 1) = 1   Product: 6*1 = 6, which is positive.So, the product (x + 4)(x - 1) is negative only in the interval -4 < x < 1. Therefore, the solution to the inequality x¬≤ + 3x - 4 < 0 is -4 < x < 1.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from f(x¬≤ + 3x - 3) < 0, since f is increasing, that implies x¬≤ + 3x - 3 < 1. Subtracting 1 gives x¬≤ + 3x - 4 < 0. Factoring that into (x + 4)(x - 1) < 0. Testing intervals, as above, gives the solution -4 < x < 1. That seems correct.Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the quadratic formula to find the roots and then determine the intervals where the quadratic is negative. Let me try that.The quadratic equation is x¬≤ + 3x - 4 = 0. Using the quadratic formula:x = [-b ¬± sqrt(b¬≤ - 4ac)] / (2a)Here, a = 1, b = 3, c = -4.So,x = [-3 ¬± sqrt(9 + 16)] / 2x = [-3 ¬± sqrt(25)] / 2x = [-3 ¬± 5] / 2So, the roots are:x = (-3 + 5)/2 = 2/2 = 1x = (-3 - 5)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4Same as before, the roots are x = -4 and x = 1. Since the coefficient of x¬≤ is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the quadratic is negative between its roots. So, the solution is indeed -4 < x < 1.Alright, so both methods give me the same result. That makes me more confident that the solution is correct.Just to recap:1. Understand that f is increasing, so f(z) < 0 implies z < 1.2. Set up the inequality x¬≤ + 3x - 3 < 1.3. Simplify to x¬≤ + 3x - 4 < 0.4. Factor or solve the quadratic to find the critical points.5. Determine the intervals where the quadratic is negative.6. Conclude that x must be between -4 and 1.I don't think I missed anything here. The function's monotonicity is key because it allows us to translate the inequality f(something) < 0 into something < 1. Without knowing that f is increasing, we couldn't make that connection.Also, it's important that f is defined on all real numbers, so there are no restrictions on the domain of x¬≤ + 3x - 3. That means we don't have to worry about the expression inside f being undefined or anything like that.Another thing to consider is whether the inequality is strict or not. Since it's f(x¬≤ + 3x - 3) < 0, we're looking for values where the expression inside f is strictly less than 1, not less than or equal. So, the endpoints x = -4 and x = 1 are not included in the solution set. That's why the interval is open, (-4, 1), not closed.Let me visualize the quadratic function x¬≤ + 3x - 4. It's a parabola opening upwards with vertex at x = -b/(2a) = -3/2. Plugging that back in, the vertex y-coordinate is (-3/2)¬≤ + 3*(-3/2) - 4 = 9/4 - 9/2 - 4 = 9/4 - 18/4 - 16/4 = (9 - 18 - 16)/4 = (-25)/4. So, the vertex is at (-1.5, -6.25). That makes sense because the parabola opens upwards and has its minimum at (-1.5, -6.25). So, it crosses the x-axis at x = -4 and x = 1, which we already found.Since the parabola is below the x-axis between its roots, that confirms that x¬≤ + 3x - 4 < 0 for -4 < x < 1.I think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any other steps or considerations needed here. The problem seems straightforward once you apply the properties of monotonic functions and solve the resulting quadratic inequality.**Final Answer**The range of values for the real number ( x ) is boxed{(-4, 1)}."},{"question":"Yvette wants to frame a new picture. When she goes to her local frame shop, she finds out that the frame she wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget of 60. She decides to buy a smaller frame instead. If she remained with 6 after buying the smaller frame, what is the ratio of the price of the smaller frame to the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy?","answer":"First, I need to determine the new price of the frame Yvette initially wanted, which is 20% more expensive than her budget of 60.To calculate 20% of 60:[0.20 times 60 = 12]Adding this to the original budget gives:[60 + 12 = 72]So, the new price of the frame she initially wanted is 72.Next, I need to find out how much Yvette spent on the smaller frame. Since she had 6 remaining after the purchase, the amount spent on the smaller frame is:[60 - 6 = 54]Now, I can find the ratio of the price of the smaller frame to the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy:[54 : 72]To simplify the ratio, I divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 18:[54 div 18 = 3][72 div 18 = 4]Therefore, the simplified ratio is:[3:4]"},{"question":"Compute arcsin left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right). Express your answer in radians.","answer":"Okay, so I need to compute the arcsine of ‚àö2 over 2. Hmm, let me think about what that means. Arcsine is the inverse function of sine, right? So if I have arcsin(x), it's asking for the angle whose sine is x. In this case, x is ‚àö2 over 2. Alright, so I need to find an angle Œ∏ such that sin(Œ∏) equals ‚àö2 over 2. I remember from my trigonometry class that there are some standard angles where the sine values are known. Let me try to recall those. I know that sin(0) is 0, sin(œÄ/2) is 1, sin(œÄ/6) is 1/2, and sin(œÄ/4) is ‚àö2 over 2. Oh, wait, that's exactly what I'm looking for! So sin(œÄ/4) is ‚àö2 over 2. That means Œ∏ should be œÄ/4. But hold on, I should make sure that œÄ/4 is within the range of the arcsine function. I remember that the range of arcsine is from -œÄ/2 to œÄ/2. Since œÄ/4 is between -œÄ/2 and œÄ/2, it should be fine. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any values. Sometimes I confuse sine and cosine values for certain angles. For example, I know that cos(œÄ/4) is also ‚àö2 over 2, but since we're dealing with sine here, it's still œÄ/4. Is there another angle where sine is ‚àö2 over 2? Well, sine is positive in the first and second quadrants, so another angle could be 3œÄ/4. But wait, 3œÄ/4 is greater than œÄ/2, which is outside the range of arcsine. So, even though sin(3œÄ/4) is ‚àö2 over 2, arcsine can't return that value because it's outside the principal range. Therefore, the only angle within the range of arcsine that satisfies sin(Œ∏) = ‚àö2 over 2 is œÄ/4. Just to be thorough, I can plug it back into the sine function to confirm. sin(œÄ/4) equals ‚àö2 over 2, which matches the original problem. So, everything checks out. I think I've got it. The arcsine of ‚àö2 over 2 is œÄ/4 radians."},{"question":"It takes 4 feet of cotton to make a tee-shirt. How many feet of material are needed to make 15 tee-shirts?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many feet of cotton are needed to make 15 tee-shirts. The problem says that it takes 4 feet of cotton to make one tee-shirt. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand it correctly.First, I'll think about what's given. We know that for one tee-shirt, 4 feet of cotton are required. So, if I have one tee-shirt, I need 4 feet. Now, the question is asking about 15 tee-shirts. That means I need to find out how much cotton is needed for 15 times the amount needed for one tee-shirt.So, mathematically, I can represent this as:Number of tee-shirts √ó Cotton per tee-shirt = Total cotton neededPlugging in the numbers:15 √ó 4 feet = ?Now, I need to perform this multiplication. Let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 15 times 4 can be calculated as:10 √ó 4 = 405 √ó 4 = 20Adding those together: 40 + 20 = 60So, 15 √ó 4 = 60Therefore, 15 tee-shirts would require 60 feet of cotton.Wait a second, let me double-check that. If one tee-shirt needs 4 feet, then 10 tee-shirts would need 40 feet, and 5 tee-shirts would need 20 feet. Adding those together gives 60 feet for 15 tee-shirts. Yeah, that seems right.Is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe by dividing instead of multiplying? Let's see. If I have 60 feet of cotton and I want to make tee-shirts that each require 4 feet, how many tee-shirts can I make?60 √∑ 4 = 15Okay, that checks out. So, 60 feet of cotton can make 15 tee-shirts, which means that 15 tee-shirts require 60 feet of cotton.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The multiplication seems correct, and the division method confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 60 feet of cotton needed to make 15 tee-shirts."},{"question":"There are some balls in a jar.

This means that for every blue ball, there are 4 non-blue balls.Given there are 4 blue balls left, the number of non-blue balls must be 4 times that, which is 4 * 4 = 16.Finally, to find the initial total number of balls, I add the initial number of blue balls (9) to the number of non-blue balls (16):T = 9 (initial blue balls) + 16 (non-blue balls) = 25.Therefore, there were initially 25 balls in the jar."},{"question":"Given the hyperbola dfrac{x^2}{6} - dfrac{y^2}{3} = 1 with foci F_1, F_2, and a point M on the hyperbola such that M F_1 perp x-axis, find the distance from F_1 to the line F_2 M (boxed{;;}).A. dfrac{3sqrt{6}}{5};B. dfrac{5sqrt{6}}{6};C. dfrac{6}{5};D. dfrac{5}{6}","answer":"Okay, so I have this hyperbola equation: (x¬≤)/6 - (y¬≤)/3 = 1. I need to find the distance from F‚ÇÅ to the line F‚ÇÇM, where M is a point on the hyperbola such that MF‚ÇÅ is perpendicular to the x-axis. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out step by step.First, I remember that for a hyperbola of the form (x¬≤)/a¬≤ - (y¬≤)/b¬≤ = 1, the foci are located at (¬±c, 0), where c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤. So, in this case, a¬≤ is 6 and b¬≤ is 3. Let me calculate c.c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤ = 6 + 3 = 9, so c = 3. That means the foci are at (-3, 0) and (3, 0). So, F‚ÇÅ is (-3, 0) and F‚ÇÇ is (3, 0).Now, point M is on the hyperbola, and MF‚ÇÅ is perpendicular to the x-axis. Since MF‚ÇÅ is perpendicular to the x-axis, that means it's a vertical line. So, the line MF‚ÇÅ is vertical, which implies that M has the same x-coordinate as F‚ÇÅ. Wait, no, because if MF‚ÇÅ is vertical, then M must lie directly above or below F‚ÇÅ on the y-axis. But F‚ÇÅ is at (-3, 0). So, M must be at (-3, y) for some y.But wait, M is on the hyperbola, so plugging x = -3 into the hyperbola equation should give me the y-coordinate.Let me do that: ( (-3)¬≤ ) /6 - (y¬≤)/3 = 1 => 9/6 - y¬≤/3 = 1 => 3/2 - y¬≤/3 = 1.Subtracting 1 from both sides: 3/2 - 1 = y¬≤/3 => 1/2 = y¬≤/3 => y¬≤ = 3/2 => y = ¬±‚àö(3/2) = ¬±(‚àö6)/2.So, M is at (-3, (‚àö6)/2) or (-3, -(‚àö6)/2). Since the problem doesn't specify, I guess either one would work, but let's pick the positive y-coordinate for simplicity. So, M is (-3, (‚àö6)/2).Wait, hold on. If M is at (-3, (‚àö6)/2), then the line MF‚ÇÇ connects M(-3, (‚àö6)/2) to F‚ÇÇ(3, 0). I need to find the distance from F‚ÇÅ(-3, 0) to this line.Hmm, okay. So, first, I need the equation of the line F‚ÇÇM. Let me find the slope of F‚ÇÇM.Slope m = (0 - (‚àö6)/2) / (3 - (-3)) = (-‚àö6/2) / 6 = (-‚àö6)/12.So, the slope is -‚àö6/12. Now, using point-slope form, let's write the equation of the line.Using point F‚ÇÇ(3, 0):y - 0 = (-‚àö6/12)(x - 3)So, y = (-‚àö6/12)x + (‚àö6/12)*3 = (-‚àö6/12)x + (‚àö6)/4.So, the equation of line F‚ÇÇM is y = (-‚àö6/12)x + (‚àö6)/4.Now, I need the distance from F‚ÇÅ(-3, 0) to this line. The formula for the distance from a point (x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax‚ÇÄ + by‚ÇÄ + c| / sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤).First, let me write the equation of the line in standard form.Starting from y = (-‚àö6/12)x + (‚àö6)/4.Bring all terms to one side:(‚àö6/12)x + y - (‚àö6)/4 = 0.So, a = ‚àö6/12, b = 1, c = -‚àö6/4.Now, plug in F‚ÇÅ(-3, 0):Distance = |(‚àö6/12)*(-3) + 1*0 - ‚àö6/4| / sqrt( (‚àö6/12)¬≤ + 1¬≤ )Calculate numerator:(‚àö6/12)*(-3) = -3‚àö6/12 = -‚àö6/4So, numerator is |-‚àö6/4 - ‚àö6/4| = |-2‚àö6/4| = | -‚àö6/2 | = ‚àö6/2.Denominator:sqrt( ( (‚àö6/12)¬≤ + 1 ) ) = sqrt( (6/144) + 1 ) = sqrt( (1/24) + 1 ) = sqrt(25/24) = 5/(2‚àö6) = 5‚àö6/12.Wait, let me check that:(‚àö6/12)¬≤ = 6/144 = 1/24.So, 1/24 + 1 = 25/24.sqrt(25/24) = 5/(2‚àö6). Rationalizing the denominator: 5‚àö6/12.So, denominator is 5‚àö6/12.So, distance is (‚àö6/2) / (5‚àö6/12) = (‚àö6/2) * (12/(5‚àö6)) = (12‚àö6)/(10‚àö6) = 12/10 = 6/5.So, the distance is 6/5, which is option C.Wait, let me just double-check my calculations.First, equation of the line: y = (-‚àö6/12)x + ‚àö6/4.Converted to standard form: (‚àö6/12)x + y - ‚àö6/4 = 0.Distance formula: |(‚àö6/12)(-3) + 0 - ‚àö6/4| / sqrt( (‚àö6/12)^2 + 1 )Numerator: (-3‚àö6)/12 - ‚àö6/4 = (-‚àö6)/4 - ‚àö6/4 = (-2‚àö6)/4 = -‚àö6/2. Absolute value is ‚àö6/2.Denominator: sqrt( (6/144) + 1 ) = sqrt(1/24 + 1) = sqrt(25/24) = 5/(2‚àö6) = 5‚àö6/12.So, distance is (‚àö6/2) / (5‚àö6/12) = (‚àö6/2) * (12/(5‚àö6)) = (12‚àö6)/(10‚àö6) = 12/10 = 6/5.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 6/5, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given that one focus of the ellipse C:frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+frac{y^{2}}{4}=1 is at (2,0), find the eccentricity of C (     )A: frac{1}{3}B: frac{1}{2}C: frac{sqrt{2}}{2}D: frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an ellipse, and I need to find its eccentricity. The equation given is ( C: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 ), and one of the foci is at ( (2, 0) ). The options are A: ( frac{1}{3} ), B: ( frac{1}{2} ), C: ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), and D: ( frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the standard form of an ellipse is ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. Depending on whether the major axis is along the x-axis or y-axis, ( a ) and ( b ) switch places. In this case, since the focus is on the x-axis at ( (2, 0) ), I think the major axis must be along the x-axis. That means ( a > b ).Wait, let me confirm that. If the major axis were along the y-axis, the foci would be on the y-axis, right? Since the focus is at ( (2, 0) ), it's on the x-axis, so the major axis is along the x-axis. So, ( a ) is the semi-major axis, and ( b ) is the semi-minor axis.Given that, the standard form is ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), where ( a > b ). The distance from the center to each focus is ( c ), and for an ellipse, ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 ). The eccentricity ( e ) is defined as ( e = frac{c}{a} ).Okay, so I need to find ( e ). I know that one of the foci is at ( (2, 0) ), so the distance from the center (which is at ( (0, 0) )) to this focus is ( c = 2 ). So, ( c = 2 ).I also know that ( b^2 = 4 ) from the equation of the ellipse. So, ( b = 2 ). Now, since ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 ), I can plug in the known values to solve for ( a^2 ).Let me write that down:( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 )We have ( c = 2 ), so ( c^2 = 4 ), and ( b^2 = 4 ). Plugging these in:( 4 = a^2 - 4 )So, solving for ( a^2 ):( a^2 = 4 + 4 = 8 )Therefore, ( a = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2} ).Now, the eccentricity ( e ) is ( frac{c}{a} ). So, plugging in the values:( e = frac{2}{2sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} )Hmm, ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ) can be rationalized as ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). So, ( e = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).Looking back at the options, that's option C. So, I think the answer is C.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Identified the major axis correctly? Yes, since the focus is on the x-axis, major axis is along x-axis, so ( a > b ).2. Calculated ( c ) correctly? Yes, distance from center to focus is 2, so ( c = 2 ).3. ( b^2 = 4 ), so ( b = 2 ). That seems right.4. Then, ( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 ) leads to ( 4 = a^2 - 4 ), so ( a^2 = 8 ), hence ( a = 2sqrt{2} ). That looks correct.5. Eccentricity ( e = c/a = 2/(2sqrt{2}) = 1/sqrt{2} = sqrt{2}/2 ). Yep, that's correct.So, I think I did everything right. The eccentricity is ( sqrt{2}/2 ), which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Find the ratio of the volume of a cone to the volume of a cylinder where the cone has a height which is one-third the height of the cylinder.

The probability that cos{x} geq frac{1}{2} is (   )A: frac{3}{4}B: frac{2}{3}C: frac{1}{2}D: frac{1}{3}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the probability that the cosine of a randomly selected real number x in the interval [-œÄ/2, œÄ/2] is greater than or equal to 1/2. The options are A: 3/4, B: 2/3, C: 1/2, and D: 1/3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that probability in a continuous interval is usually the length of the favorable interval divided by the length of the entire interval. So, in this case, the entire interval is from -œÄ/2 to œÄ/2. Let me calculate the length of that interval first. The length is œÄ/2 - (-œÄ/2) which is œÄ. So, the total length is œÄ.Now, I need to find the interval where cos(x) is greater than or equal to 1/2. I remember that the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and it's symmetric around 0. So, in the interval [-œÄ/2, œÄ/2], the cosine function starts at 0 when x is -œÄ/2, increases to 1 at x=0, and then decreases back to 0 at x=œÄ/2.I need to find the values of x where cos(x) ‚â• 1/2. Let me recall the unit circle. Cosine of an angle is equal to the x-coordinate on the unit circle. So, cos(x) = 1/2 occurs at specific angles. In the first quadrant, cos(œÄ/3) = 1/2, and similarly, in the fourth quadrant, cos(-œÄ/3) = 1/2. So, the solutions to cos(x) = 1/2 in the interval [-œÄ/2, œÄ/2] are x = -œÄ/3 and x = œÄ/3.Therefore, the values of x where cos(x) is greater than or equal to 1/2 are between -œÄ/3 and œÄ/3. So, the favorable interval is from -œÄ/3 to œÄ/3.Now, let me calculate the length of this favorable interval. The length is œÄ/3 - (-œÄ/3) which is 2œÄ/3.So, the probability is the length of the favorable interval divided by the length of the entire interval. That would be (2œÄ/3) divided by œÄ, which simplifies to 2/3.Wait, let me double-check that. The entire interval is œÄ, and the favorable interval is 2œÄ/3. So, 2œÄ/3 divided by œÄ is indeed 2/3. That seems right.But just to make sure, let me visualize the cosine function. From -œÄ/2 to œÄ/2, it starts at 0, goes up to 1 at 0, and back to 0. The points where it's equal to 1/2 are at -œÄ/3 and œÄ/3. So, between those points, the cosine is above 1/2. So, the favorable interval is indeed from -œÄ/3 to œÄ/3, which is 2œÄ/3 in length.Therefore, the probability is 2/3, which is option B.I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key steps were identifying where cos(x) equals 1/2 in the given interval and then calculating the lengths accordingly. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's B: 2/3.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow {a}=(-3,2), overrightarrow {b}=(2,1), overrightarrow {c}=(3,-1), and t‚ààR.(1) Find the minimum value of | overrightarrow {a}+t overrightarrow {b}| and the corresponding t value;(2) If overrightarrow {a}-t overrightarrow {b} is collinear with overrightarrow {c}, find the real number t.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem with vectors, and I need to solve two parts. Let me take it step by step. First, let me understand what each part is asking.Part (1): I need to find the minimum value of the magnitude of vector a plus t times vector b, and also find the corresponding t value. Vector a is (-3, 2), vector b is (2, 1), and t is a real number.Part (2): If vector a minus t times vector b is collinear with vector c, which is (3, -1), I need to find the real number t.Alright, starting with part (1). So, I need to compute |a + t b| and find its minimum value. Hmm, okay. Let me recall that the magnitude of a vector (x, y) is sqrt(x¬≤ + y¬≤). So, first, I should compute the vector a + t b.Given a = (-3, 2) and b = (2, 1), then a + t b would be:a + t b = (-3 + 2t, 2 + t)So, that's the vector. Now, the magnitude squared of this vector is (-3 + 2t)¬≤ + (2 + t)¬≤. Maybe it's easier to work with the square of the magnitude because the square root can complicate things when taking derivatives or completing the square.Let me compute that:|a + t b|¬≤ = (-3 + 2t)¬≤ + (2 + t)¬≤Let me expand each term:First term: (-3 + 2t)¬≤ = (-3)¬≤ + (2t)¬≤ + 2*(-3)*(2t) = 9 + 4t¬≤ - 12tSecond term: (2 + t)¬≤ = 2¬≤ + t¬≤ + 2*2*t = 4 + t¬≤ + 4tNow, adding both terms together:9 + 4t¬≤ - 12t + 4 + t¬≤ + 4t = (9 + 4) + (4t¬≤ + t¬≤) + (-12t + 4t) = 13 + 5t¬≤ - 8tSo, |a + t b|¬≤ = 5t¬≤ - 8t + 13Now, to find the minimum value of this quadratic function in t, I can complete the square or take the derivative. Since this is a quadratic function, it will have a minimum at t = -b/(2a) where the quadratic is in the form at¬≤ + bt + c.In this case, a = 5, b = -8. So, t = -(-8)/(2*5) = 8/10 = 4/5.So, the minimum occurs at t = 4/5.Now, to find the minimum value, plug t = 4/5 back into |a + t b|¬≤:5*(4/5)¬≤ - 8*(4/5) + 13Let me compute each term:5*(16/25) = 80/25 = 16/5-8*(4/5) = -32/5So, adding them up: 16/5 - 32/5 + 13 = (-16/5) + 13Convert 13 to fifths: 13 = 65/5So, -16/5 + 65/5 = 49/5Therefore, |a + t b|¬≤ = 49/5 at t = 4/5, so |a + t b| = sqrt(49/5) = 7/sqrt(5). To rationalize the denominator, that's (7 sqrt(5))/5.So, the minimum value is 7/sqrt(5) or (7 sqrt(5))/5, and it occurs at t = 4/5.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, when I expanded (-3 + 2t)¬≤, I got 9 + 4t¬≤ -12t, which seems correct.Then, (2 + t)¬≤ is 4 + t¬≤ + 4t, that's also correct.Adding them together: 9 + 4 is 13, 4t¬≤ + t¬≤ is 5t¬≤, -12t + 4t is -8t. So, 5t¬≤ -8t +13. That's correct.Then, taking the derivative approach or vertex formula. Since it's a quadratic, the vertex is at t = -b/(2a) = 8/(2*5) = 4/5. That seems right.Plugging t = 4/5 into the quadratic: 5*(16/25) -8*(4/5) +13 = 80/25 -32/5 +13.80/25 is 16/5, 32/5 is 32/5, so 16/5 - 32/5 is -16/5, and -16/5 +13 is -16/5 +65/5 = 49/5. So, sqrt(49/5) is 7/sqrt(5). Yep, that's correct.So, part (1) is done. The minimum value is 7/sqrt(5) and occurs at t = 4/5.Moving on to part (2). It says that a - t b is collinear with c. Vector c is (3, -1). So, if two vectors are collinear, one is a scalar multiple of the other. That means there exists some scalar k such that a - t b = k c.Given that, let me write down the vectors.a = (-3, 2), b = (2, 1), so a - t b = (-3 - 2t, 2 - t).Vector c is (3, -1). So, if a - t b is collinear with c, then (-3 - 2t, 2 - t) = k*(3, -1) for some scalar k.This gives us two equations:-3 - 2t = 3k2 - t = -kSo, we have a system of two equations with two variables: t and k.Let me write them:1) -3 - 2t = 3k2) 2 - t = -kI can solve for k from equation 2 and substitute into equation 1.From equation 2: 2 - t = -k => k = t - 2Now, substitute k = t - 2 into equation 1:-3 - 2t = 3*(t - 2)Let me expand the right side: 3t - 6So, equation becomes:-3 - 2t = 3t - 6Let me bring all terms to one side:-3 -2t -3t +6 = 0 => (-3 +6) + (-2t -3t) = 3 -5t =0So, 3 -5t =0 => -5t = -3 => t = 3/5So, t is 3/5.Let me check if this is correct.Compute a - t b:a = (-3, 2), b = (2,1), t = 3/5.So, a - t b = (-3 - 2*(3/5), 2 - (3/5)) = (-3 - 6/5, 2 - 3/5)Convert to fifths:-3 is -15/5, so -15/5 -6/5 = -21/52 is 10/5, so 10/5 -3/5 = 7/5So, a - t b = (-21/5, 7/5)Vector c is (3, -1). Let's see if (-21/5, 7/5) is a scalar multiple of (3, -1).Let me see: Is (-21/5)/3 = (7/5)/(-1)?Compute (-21/5)/3 = (-21/5)*(1/3) = -7/5Compute (7/5)/(-1) = -7/5Yes, both are equal to -7/5. So, indeed, (-21/5, 7/5) = (-7/5)*(3, -1). So, it's a scalar multiple, hence collinear.Therefore, t = 3/5 is correct.So, summarizing:Part (1): Minimum value is 7/sqrt(5) at t = 4/5.Part (2): t = 3/5.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**(1) The minimum value is boxed{dfrac{7sqrt{5}}{5}} and the corresponding t is boxed{dfrac{4}{5}}.(2) The real number t is boxed{dfrac{3}{5}}."},{"question":"Given that the base edge length of a regular triangular prism ABC-A_{1}B_{1}C_{1} is 6, and the height of the prism is sqrt{3}, find the surface area of the circumscribed sphere of this prism.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a regular triangular prism, and I need to find the surface area of its circumscribed sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A regular triangular prism has two congruent equilateral triangles as its bases and three rectangles connecting the corresponding sides. The base edge length is given as 6, and the height of the prism is ‚àö3. First, I need to understand what a circumscribed sphere around a prism is. I think it means a sphere that passes through all the vertices of the prism. So, the sphere touches all the corners of the prism. To find the surface area of this sphere, I need to find its radius first because the surface area formula is 4œÄR¬≤.Alright, so how do I find the radius of this sphere? I remember that for a prism, the circumscribed sphere's center is equidistant from all the vertices. That means the center should be somewhere along the line that's perpendicular to the bases and passes through their centroids. Let me break it down. The prism has two triangular bases. Each base is an equilateral triangle with side length 6. The centroid of an equilateral triangle is also its circumcenter, right? So, the distance from the centroid to any vertex is the circumradius of the triangle. Wait, how do I calculate the circumradius of an equilateral triangle? I think it's (a)/(‚àö3), where a is the side length. Let me verify that. For an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio. The length of the median can be found using Pythagoras: if each side is 6, then half of a side is 3. So, the median length is ‚àö(6¬≤ - 3¬≤) = ‚àö(36 - 9) = ‚àö27 = 3‚àö3. Since the centroid is 2/3 of the way along the median, the circumradius is (2/3)*3‚àö3 = 2‚àö3. Okay, so the circumradius of each base is 2‚àö3.Now, the prism has a height of ‚àö3. So, the distance between the two bases is ‚àö3. The center of the sphere should be somewhere along the line connecting the centroids of the two bases. Let me denote the distance from the center of the sphere to each base as h. Since the total height of the prism is ‚àö3, the distance from the center to each base would be h and (‚àö3 - h). But since the sphere is circumscribed, these distances should satisfy some condition.Wait, actually, the sphere's center should be equidistant from all the vertices, including those on both bases. So, the distance from the center to any vertex on the top base should be equal to the distance from the center to any vertex on the bottom base. Let me denote the center of the sphere as point O. The distance from O to any vertex on the bottom base is the same as the distance from O to any vertex on the top base. Let me model this in 3D coordinates to make it clearer.Let me place the prism in a coordinate system. Let's put the bottom base triangle ABC in the xy-plane, with point A at (0, 0, 0), point B at (6, 0, 0), and point C at (3, 3‚àö3, 0). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. For an equilateral triangle with side length 6, the height is (‚àö3/2)*6 = 3‚àö3. So, yes, point C would be at (3, 3‚àö3, 0). Then, the top base triangle A‚ÇÅB‚ÇÅC‚ÇÅ would be at height ‚àö3, so their coordinates would be A‚ÇÅ(0, 0, ‚àö3), B‚ÇÅ(6, 0, ‚àö3), and C‚ÇÅ(3, 3‚àö3, ‚àö3). Now, the centroid of the bottom base is at the average of the coordinates of A, B, and C. So, centroid O‚ÇÅ is at ((0 + 6 + 3)/3, (0 + 0 + 3‚àö3)/3, 0) = (3, ‚àö3, 0). Similarly, the centroid of the top base O‚ÇÇ is at (3, ‚àö3, ‚àö3).So, the line connecting O‚ÇÅ and O‚ÇÇ is along the z-axis from (3, ‚àö3, 0) to (3, ‚àö3, ‚àö3). The center of the sphere O must lie somewhere on this line. Let's denote O as (3, ‚àö3, k), where k is between 0 and ‚àö3.Now, the distance from O to any vertex on the bottom base should be equal to the distance from O to any vertex on the top base. Let's compute the distance from O to point A(0, 0, 0) and to point A‚ÇÅ(0, 0, ‚àö3).Distance OA: ‚àö[(3 - 0)¬≤ + (‚àö3 - 0)¬≤ + (k - 0)¬≤] = ‚àö[9 + 3 + k¬≤] = ‚àö(12 + k¬≤)Distance OA‚ÇÅ: ‚àö[(3 - 0)¬≤ + (‚àö3 - 0)¬≤ + (k - ‚àö3)¬≤] = ‚àö[9 + 3 + (k - ‚àö3)¬≤] = ‚àö(12 + (k - ‚àö3)¬≤)Since OA = OA‚ÇÅ, we have:‚àö(12 + k¬≤) = ‚àö(12 + (k - ‚àö3)¬≤)Squaring both sides:12 + k¬≤ = 12 + (k - ‚àö3)¬≤Simplify:k¬≤ = k¬≤ - 2k‚àö3 + 3Subtract k¬≤ from both sides:0 = -2k‚àö3 + 3So, 2k‚àö3 = 3 => k = 3/(2‚àö3) = ‚àö3/2Okay, so the center of the sphere is at (3, ‚àö3, ‚àö3/2). Now, let's compute the radius R of the sphere. Let's compute the distance from O to point A(0, 0, 0):R = ‚àö[(3 - 0)¬≤ + (‚àö3 - 0)¬≤ + (‚àö3/2 - 0)¬≤] = ‚àö[9 + 3 + (3/4)] = ‚àö[12 + 0.75] = ‚àö[12.75] = ‚àö(51/4) = (‚àö51)/2So, the radius R is ‚àö51 / 2.Therefore, the surface area of the sphere is 4œÄR¬≤ = 4œÄ*(51/4) = 51œÄ.Wait, let me double-check my calculations. The centroid of the base triangle is at (3, ‚àö3, 0), right? Because for an equilateral triangle with vertices at (0,0), (6,0), and (3, 3‚àö3), the centroid is indeed the average of the coordinates, which is (3, ‚àö3, 0). Then, the center of the sphere is halfway along the line connecting the centroids of the two bases, which is at (3, ‚àö3, ‚àö3/2). Calculating the distance from this center to a vertex: Let's take point A(0,0,0). The differences in coordinates are (3, ‚àö3, ‚àö3/2). Squaring each component: 9, 3, and (3/4). Adding them up: 9 + 3 + 0.75 = 12.75, which is 51/4. So, the radius squared is 51/4, so R is ‚àö(51)/2. Then, the surface area is 4œÄ*(51/4) = 51œÄ. That seems correct. I think I got it right. So, the surface area of the circumscribed sphere is 51œÄ.**Final Answer**The surface area of the circumscribed sphere is boxed{51pi}."},{"question":"A map shows a parallelogram-shaped property where the scale is 200 miles to 1 inch.

Let me start by understanding what the substitution method is all about. From the material provided, it seems like substitution involves replacing a part of the polynomial with a new variable to simplify the expression, making it easier to factorize. Looking at Little Hu's solution, he used substitution to factorize the polynomial ((x^{2}-2x-1)(x^{2}-2x+3)+4). He let (x^{2}-2x = y), which transformed the original expression into ((y-1)(y+3)+4). Then, he expanded this to (y^{2}+2y+1), recognized it as a perfect square, and rewrote it as ((y+1)^{2}), which further simplified to ((x^{2}-2x+1)^{2}). Finally, he substituted back to get ((x-1)^{4}). Okay, that makes sense. Now, let's move on to the questions.**Question (1):** In Little Hu's solution, the step from Step 2 to Step 3 uses the factorization of ______. The options are extracting common factors method, square difference formula method, or complete square formula method.So, Step 2 is (y^{2} + 2y + 1), and Step 3 is ((y + 1)^{2}). This is clearly recognizing a perfect square trinomial, which is (a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} = (a + b)^{2}). Therefore, this is the complete square formula method. So, the answer should be option C.**Question (2):** The teacher said that Little Hu's factorization result is not thorough. So, I need to write down the final result of the factorization.Little Hu ended up with ((x^{2}-2x+1)^{2}). But (x^{2}-2x+1) is itself a perfect square, as it can be factored into ((x - 1)^{2}). Therefore, substituting back, we have ((x - 1)^{4}). So, the thorough factorization is ((x - 1)^{4}).**Question (3):** I need to use the substitution method to factorize the polynomial ((x^{2}+6x)(x^{2}+6x+18)+81).Alright, let's apply the substitution method here. First, I'll let (y = x^{2} + 6x). Then, the original expression becomes (y(y + 18) + 81). Let's expand this: (y^{2} + 18y + 81). Hmm, this looks like a perfect square trinomial as well. It can be written as ((y + 9)^{2}). Now, substituting back (y = x^{2} + 6x), we get ((x^{2} + 6x + 9)^{2}). Wait, (x^{2} + 6x + 9) is also a perfect square, which factors into ((x + 3)^{2}). Therefore, the entire expression becomes ((x + 3)^{4}).Let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with substitution, expanding, recognizing the perfect square, substituting back, and then factoring further. It all seems to add up correctly. So, I think my final answer is correct.In summary, for the three questions:1. The step from Step 2 to Step 3 uses the complete square formula method.2. The thorough factorization result is ((x - 1)^{4}).3. Using substitution, the polynomial factors into ((x + 3)^{4}).I feel confident about these answers after walking through each step carefully."},{"question":"In the regular hexagon ( A B C D E F ), two of the diagonals, ( F C ) and ( B D ), intersect at ( G ). The ratio of the area of quadrilateral FEDG to the area of ( triangle B C G ) is:(A) ( 3 sqrt{3}: 1 )(B) ( 4: 1 )(C) ( 6: 1 )(D) ( 2 sqrt{3}: 1 )(E) ( 5: 1 )","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a regular hexagon (ABCDEF). The question is about finding the ratio of the area of quadrilateral (FEDG) to the area of triangle (BCG), where (G) is the intersection point of diagonals (FC) and (BD). The answer choices are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.First, I need to visualize the regular hexagon. A regular hexagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal to (120^circ). The diagonals in a regular hexagon have some interesting properties. I remember that in a regular hexagon, the diagonals can intersect each other at various points, creating smaller triangles and other polygons inside.So, let me try to sketch this in my mind. Hexagon (ABCDEF) with points labeled in order. Diagonals (FC) and (BD) intersect at point (G). I need to figure out the areas of quadrilateral (FEDG) and triangle (BCG).Maybe it would help to assign coordinates to the hexagon. Let me assume the hexagon is centered at the origin, and one of its vertices is at ((1, 0)). Since it's regular, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined using trigonometric functions.But before diving into coordinates, perhaps there's a simpler way using properties of regular hexagons. I recall that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex. Each of these triangles has equal area.Wait, but in this problem, the diagonals (FC) and (BD) intersect at (G). So, maybe I can use the properties of these diagonals and their intersection to find the areas.Let me think about the diagonals in a regular hexagon. In a regular hexagon, the length of the diagonals can be of different types. For example, in a regular hexagon with side length (s), the shorter diagonals (connecting every other vertex) are equal to (ssqrt{3}), and the longer diagonals (connecting vertices with two vertices in between) are equal to (2s).But in this case, diagonals (FC) and (BD) intersect at (G). So, (FC) is a diagonal connecting (F) and (C), which are three vertices apart, so that's a longer diagonal. Similarly, (BD) connects (B) and (D), which are two vertices apart, so that's a shorter diagonal.Wait, actually, in a regular hexagon, the diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip. Diagonals that skip one vertex are shorter, and those that skip two vertices are longer. So, (BD) skips one vertex, making it a shorter diagonal, and (FC) skips two vertices, making it a longer diagonal.So, (FC) is a longer diagonal, and (BD) is a shorter diagonal. Their intersection is at point (G). I need to find the ratio of areas involving (FEDG) and (BCG).Maybe I can use coordinate geometry to find the exact coordinates of (G) and then compute the areas. Let's try that approach.Let me place the regular hexagon on a coordinate system with the center at the origin ((0, 0)). Let's assume the side length of the hexagon is 1 for simplicity. Then, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined using the unit circle.The coordinates of the vertices of a regular hexagon centered at the origin are:- (A = (1, 0))- (B = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (C = left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (D = (-1, 0))- (E = left(-frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))So, now I have the coordinates of all the vertices. Now, I need to find the equations of diagonals (FC) and (BD) and find their intersection point (G).First, let's find the coordinates of points (F), (C), (B), and (D):- (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (C = left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (B = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (D = (-1, 0))Now, let's find the equations of lines (FC) and (BD).Starting with diagonal (FC):- Point (F) is (left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- Point (C) is (left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))The slope of line (FC) is:[m_{FC} = frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)}{-frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{-1} = -sqrt{3}]So, the equation of line (FC) is:[y - left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = -sqrt{3}left(x - frac{1}{2}right)]Simplifying:[y + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -sqrt{3}x + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}][y = -sqrt{3}x + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}][y = -sqrt{3}x]So, the equation of (FC) is (y = -sqrt{3}x).Now, let's find the equation of diagonal (BD):- Point (B) is (left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- Point (D) is ((-1, 0))The slope of line (BD) is:[m_{BD} = frac{0 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{-1 - frac{1}{2}} = frac{-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{-frac{3}{2}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}]So, the equation of line (BD) is:[y - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}left(x - frac{1}{2}right)]Simplifying:[y = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}x - frac{1}{2sqrt{3}} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}][y = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}x + left(-frac{1}{2sqrt{3}} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)]Let me combine the constants:[-frac{1}{2sqrt{3}} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{-1 + 3}{2sqrt{3}} = frac{2}{2sqrt{3}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}]So, the equation simplifies to:[y = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}x + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}]Or:[y = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}(x + 1)]Now, we have the equations of both diagonals:- (FC: y = -sqrt{3}x)- (BD: y = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}(x + 1))To find their intersection point (G), we set the two equations equal:[-sqrt{3}x = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}(x + 1)]Multiply both sides by (sqrt{3}) to eliminate the denominator:[-3x = x + 1]Bring (x) to the left:[-3x - x = 1][-4x = 1][x = -frac{1}{4}]Now, substitute (x = -frac{1}{4}) into one of the equations to find (y). Let's use (FC: y = -sqrt{3}x):[y = -sqrt{3}left(-frac{1}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}]So, point (G) has coordinates (left(-frac{1}{4}, frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right)).Now that I have the coordinates of all relevant points, I can proceed to calculate the areas.First, let's find the area of quadrilateral (FEDG). The vertices of quadrilateral (FEDG) are (F), (E), (D), and (G).The coordinates are:- (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (E = left(-frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (D = (-1, 0))- (G = left(-frac{1}{4}, frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right))To find the area of quadrilateral (FEDG), I can use the shoelace formula, which is a method for determining the area of a polygon when the coordinates of its vertices are known.The shoelace formula is:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) |]where ( (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1, y_1) ).Let's list the coordinates in order and apply the formula.Order of points: (F), (E), (D), (G), back to (F).So, the coordinates are:1. (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))2. (E = left(-frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))3. (D = (-1, 0))4. (G = left(-frac{1}{4}, frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right))5. Back to (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))Now, compute each (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i):1. Between (F) and (E):[x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1 = left(frac{1}{2}right)left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) - left(-frac{1}{2}right)left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]2. Between (E) and (D):[x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2 = left(-frac{1}{2}right)(0) - (-1)left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = 0 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]3. Between (D) and (G):[x_3 y_4 - x_4 y_3 = (-1)left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right) - left(-frac{1}{4}right)(0) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - 0 = -frac{sqrt{3}}{4}]4. Between (G) and (F):[x_4 y_5 - x_5 y_4 = left(-frac{1}{4}right)left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) - left(frac{1}{2}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{8} - frac{sqrt{3}}{8} = 0]Now, sum all these up:[-frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4} + 0 = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = -frac{2sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{2sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = -frac{5sqrt{3}}{4}]Take the absolute value and multiply by (frac{1}{2}):[text{Area of } FEDG = frac{1}{2} times left| -frac{5sqrt{3}}{4} right| = frac{1}{2} times frac{5sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}]Wait, that seems a bit small. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the shoelace formula.Looking back, when I calculated between (E) and (D), I had:[x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2 = left(-frac{1}{2}right)(0) - (-1)left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = 0 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]That seems correct.Between (D) and (G):[x_3 y_4 - x_4 y_3 = (-1)left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right) - left(-frac{1}{4}right)(0) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - 0 = -frac{sqrt{3}}{4}]Also correct.Between (G) and (F):[x_4 y_5 - x_5 y_4 = left(-frac{1}{4}right)left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) - left(frac{1}{2}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{8} - frac{sqrt{3}}{8} = 0]That's correct too.So, the total sum is indeed (-frac{5sqrt{3}}{4}), and the area is (frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}).Hmm, but I feel like that might not be correct because when I think about the regular hexagon, the areas should be more significant. Maybe I made a mistake in the order of the points or in the shoelace formula.Wait, another thought: quadrilateral (FEDG) is a four-sided figure, but depending on the positions of the points, it might not be convex, which could affect the shoelace formula. Let me plot the points mentally:- (F) is at (left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)), which is the lower right vertex.- (E) is at (left(-frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)), the lower left vertex.- (D) is at ((-1, 0)), the leftmost vertex.- (G) is at (left(-frac{1}{4}, frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right)), somewhere in the upper left.So, connecting (F) to (E) to (D) to (G) and back to (F). This should form a quadrilateral that is somewhat trapezoidal but not necessarily convex. Maybe the shoelace formula still works as long as the points are ordered correctly.Alternatively, perhaps I should divide the quadrilateral into two triangles and calculate their areas separately.Let me try that approach.Divide (FEDG) into triangles (FED) and (FGD).First, triangle (FED):- Points (F), (E), (D).Using the shoelace formula for triangle (FED):Coordinates:1. (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))2. (E = left(-frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))3. (D = (-1, 0))4. Back to (F)Compute:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} |(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_4) - (y_1 x_2 + y_2 x_3 + y_3 x_4)|]Plugging in:[= frac{1}{2} | left(frac{1}{2} times -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + -frac{1}{2} times 0 + (-1) times -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) - left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times -frac{1}{2} + -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times -1 + 0 times frac{1}{2}right) |]Simplify step by step:First part:[frac{1}{2} times -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{4}][-frac{1}{2} times 0 = 0][-1 times -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Sum of first parts:[-frac{sqrt{3}}{4} + 0 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}]Second part:[-frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times -frac{1}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}][-frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times -1 = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}][0 times frac{1}{2} = 0]Sum of second parts:[frac{sqrt{3}}{4} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 0 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4}]Now, subtract:[frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} = -frac{2sqrt{3}}{4} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Take absolute value and multiply by (frac{1}{2}):[text{Area of } FED = frac{1}{2} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}]Wait, that seems too small. Let me check my calculations again.Wait, no, the shoelace formula for a triangle is:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|]Let me use this formula instead.Plugging in the coordinates:- (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (E = left(-frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (D = (-1, 0))Compute:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | frac{1}{2}left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - 0right) + left(-frac{1}{2}right)left(0 - left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)right) + (-1)left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)right) |]Simplify each term:1. (frac{1}{2} times left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{4})2. (-frac{1}{2} times left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{4})3. (-1 times 0 = 0)Sum:[-frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4} + 0 = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]Take absolute value and multiply by (frac{1}{2}):[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}]Hmm, same result. So, the area of triangle (FED) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{4}).Now, let's compute the area of triangle (FGD):- Points (F), (G), (D)Coordinates:- (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (G = left(-frac{1}{4}, frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right))- (D = (-1, 0))Using the shoelace formula again for triangle (FGD):[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|]Plugging in:[= frac{1}{2} | frac{1}{2}left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - 0right) + left(-frac{1}{4}right)left(0 - left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)right) + (-1)left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right) |]Simplify each term:1. (frac{1}{2} times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{sqrt{3}}{8})2. (-frac{1}{4} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{8})3. (-1 times left(-frac{3sqrt{3}}{4}right) = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4})Sum:[frac{sqrt{3}}{8} - frac{sqrt{3}}{8} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} = 0 + frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4}]Take absolute value and multiply by (frac{1}{2}):[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{8}]So, the area of triangle (FGD) is (frac{3sqrt{3}}{8}).Therefore, the total area of quadrilateral (FEDG) is the sum of the areas of (FED) and (FGD):[frac{sqrt{3}}{4} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{8} + frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} = frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}]Okay, so that confirms my earlier result. The area of quadrilateral (FEDG) is (frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}).Now, let's find the area of triangle (BCG). The points are (B), (C), and (G).Coordinates:- (B = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (C = left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right))- (G = left(-frac{1}{4}, frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right))Again, using the shoelace formula for triangle (BCG):[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|]Plugging in:[= frac{1}{2} | frac{1}{2}left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right) + left(-frac{1}{2}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) + left(-frac{1}{4}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) |]Simplify each term:1.

Let me double-check the calculations.Wait, another approach: maybe using vectors or base-height formula.Alternatively, since triangle (BCG) is a smaller triangle inside the hexagon, perhaps I can find its area relative to the whole hexagon.But let's stick with the shoelace formula for consistency.Wait, let me recast the shoelace formula step by step.Formula:[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|]Plugging in the coordinates:- (x_1 = frac{1}{2}), (y_1 = frac{sqrt{3}}{2})- (x_2 = -frac{1}{2}), (y_2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{2})- (x_3 = -frac{1}{4}), (y_3 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4})Compute each term:1. (x_1(y_2 - y_3) = frac{1}{2}left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right) = frac{1}{2} times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{sqrt{3}}{8})2. (x_2(y_3 - y_1) = -frac{1}{2}left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = -frac{1}{2} times left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{8})3. (x_3(y_1 - y_2) = -frac{1}{4}left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = -frac{1}{4} times 0 = 0)Sum:[frac{sqrt{3}}{8} + frac{sqrt{3}}{8} + 0 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}]Multiply by (frac{1}{2}):[text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{sqrt{3}}{8}]Wait, that's the same result as before. So, the area of triangle (BCG) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{8}).But now, when I look at the areas:- Area of (FEDG = frac{5sqrt{3}}{8})- Area of (BCG = frac{sqrt{3}}{8})So, the ratio is:[frac{frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}}{frac{sqrt{3}}{8}} = 5]So, the ratio is (5:1), which corresponds to option (E).But wait, I thought earlier that the area of (FEDG) was (frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}) and (BCG) was (frac{sqrt{3}}{8}), so the ratio is indeed 5:1.But let me just think again if this makes sense. The regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with area (frac{sqrt{3}}{4}) (since the side length is 1). So, the total area of the hexagon is (6 times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}).Now, the area of quadrilateral (FEDG) is (frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}), and the area of triangle (BCG) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{8}). So, the ratio is 5:1.But wait, (frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}) is less than the area of one of the equilateral triangles ((frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{8})), which doesn't make sense because quadrilateral (FEDG) should be larger than triangle (BCG). Wait, no, actually, (frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}) is approximately (1.08), and (frac{sqrt{3}}{8}) is approximately (0.216), so the ratio is about 5:1, which is consistent.But let me cross-verify with another method. Maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry differently.Alternatively, since the hexagon is regular, perhaps the ratio can be found using symmetry and properties of similar triangles.Looking back, diagonals (FC) and (BD) intersect at (G). In a regular hexagon, the intersection of diagonals divides them proportionally. Specifically, in a regular hexagon, the ratio of the segments of the diagonals is 2:1.Wait, is that the case? Let me recall. In a regular hexagon, the diagonals that connect opposite vertices (the longest diagonals) are twice the length of the side. The diagonals that connect vertices with one vertex in between are equal to (sqrt{3}) times the side length.But in this case, diagonal (FC) is a longer diagonal, and (BD) is a shorter diagonal. Their intersection (G) divides them in a certain ratio.From my earlier calculation, point (G) is at (left(-frac{1}{4}, frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right)). So, along diagonal (FC), which goes from (F = left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)) to (C = left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)), the point (G) divides (FC) into two segments: (FG) and (GC).Calculating the lengths:- Distance from (F) to (G):[sqrt{left(-frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)right)^2} = sqrt{left(-frac{3}{4}right)^2 + left(frac{3sqrt{3}}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{9}{16} + frac{27}{16}} = sqrt{frac{36}{16}} = frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{2}]- Distance from (G) to (C):[sqrt{left(-frac{1}{2} - left(-frac{1}{4}right)right)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{left(-frac{1}{4}right)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{1}{16} + frac{3}{16}} = sqrt{frac{4}{16}} = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2}]So, the ratio (FG:GC = frac{3}{2} : frac{1}{2} = 3:1).Similarly, along diagonal (BD), which goes from (B = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)) to (D = (-1, 0)), the point (G) divides (BD) into segments (BG) and (GD).Calculating the lengths:- Distance from (B) to (G):[sqrt{left(-frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{left(-frac{3}{4}right)^2 + left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{9}{16} + frac{3}{16}} = sqrt{frac{12}{16}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]- Distance from (G) to (D):[sqrt{left(-1 - left(-frac{1}{4}right)right)^2 + left(0 - frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{left(-frac{3}{4}right)^2 + left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{9}{16} + frac{3}{16}} = sqrt{frac{12}{16}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]So, the ratio (BG:GD = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} : frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 1:1).Interesting, so (G) divides (FC) in a 3:1 ratio and (BD) in a 1:1 ratio.Now, knowing this, perhaps I can use area ratios based on similar triangles or section formulas.Since (G) divides (FC) in a 3:1 ratio, the areas of triangles involving (G) can be related accordingly.But I already calculated the areas using coordinates, so perhaps I can use that.Wait, another thought: since the entire hexagon is divided into smaller triangles by the diagonals, maybe I can count the number of such triangles in (FEDG) and (BCG).Given that the hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles by the center, but with the diagonals (FC) and (BD), more smaller triangles are formed.But perhaps it's more complicated.Alternatively, since I have the areas calculated as (frac{5sqrt{3}}{8}) for (FEDG) and (frac{sqrt{3}}{8}) for (BCG), their ratio is 5:1, which is option (E).But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach using vectors.Let me denote vectors from the origin to each point.But perhaps that's overcomplicating.Alternatively, using the concept of similar triangles.Given that (G) divides (FC) in a 3:1 ratio, perhaps the areas of triangles sharing the same base or height can be related.But I think the coordinate method is solid here, and the ratio comes out to 5:1.Therefore, I think the correct answer is (E) (5:1).**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Prove that there are infinitely many natural numbers ( a ) with the following property: for every natural number ( n ), the number ( z = n^4 + a ) is not a prime number.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to prove that there are infinitely many natural numbers ( a ) such that for every natural number ( n ), the number ( z = n^4 + a ) is not a prime number. Hmm, interesting. I remember that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, if I can show that ( z ) can always be factored into smaller natural numbers, then ( z ) isn't prime. Let me think about how to factor ( n^4 + a ). Maybe I can use some algebraic identities or factorization techniques. I recall that sometimes expressions like ( n^4 + a ) can be factored into quadratics or other polynomials. For example, ( n^4 + 4 ) can be factored as ( (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2) ). That's a nice trick. Maybe I can generalize this.So, if I set ( a = 4k^4 ) for some natural number ( k ), then ( n^4 + 4k^4 ) might factor similarly. Let me try that. Let's see:( n^4 + 4k^4 = (n^2)^2 + (2k^2)^2 ). Hmm, that's a sum of squares, which doesn't factor over the integers. Wait, but I remember that ( n^4 + 4k^4 ) can be written as ( (n^2 + 2kn + 2k^2)(n^2 - 2kn + 2k^2) ). Let me check that:Multiply ( (n^2 + 2kn + 2k^2)(n^2 - 2kn + 2k^2) ):- First, multiply ( n^2 times n^2 = n^4 ).- Then, ( n^2 times (-2kn) = -2kn^3 ).- ( n^2 times 2k^2 = 2k^2n^2 ).- ( 2kn times n^2 = 2kn^3 ).- ( 2kn times (-2kn) = -4k^2n^2 ).- ( 2kn times 2k^2 = 4k^3n ).- ( 2k^2 times n^2 = 2k^2n^2 ).- ( 2k^2 times (-2kn) = -4k^3n ).- ( 2k^2 times 2k^2 = 4k^4 ).Now, let's add all these terms together:- ( n^4 )- ( -2kn^3 + 2kn^3 = 0 )- ( 2k^2n^2 - 4k^2n^2 + 2k^2n^2 = 0 )- ( 4k^3n - 4k^3n = 0 )- ( 4k^4 )So, combining them, we get ( n^4 + 4k^4 ). Perfect! So, ( n^4 + 4k^4 ) factors into ( (n^2 + 2kn + 2k^2)(n^2 - 2kn + 2k^2) ). Now, for ( z = n^4 + a ) to be composite, both factors ( (n^2 + 2kn + 2k^2) ) and ( (n^2 - 2kn + 2k^2) ) must be greater than 1. Let's check if that's the case.Consider ( n^2 + 2kn + 2k^2 ). Since ( n ) and ( k ) are natural numbers, this expression is definitely greater than 1 because all terms are positive. Similarly, ( n^2 - 2kn + 2k^2 ) can be rewritten as ( (n - k)^2 + k^2 ). Since squares are non-negative, this is also at least ( k^2 ), which is greater than 1 for ( k > 1 ).Therefore, if we choose ( a = 4k^4 ) where ( k ) is a natural number greater than 1, then ( z = n^4 + a ) will always be composite for any natural number ( n ). But the problem asks for infinitely many such ( a ). Since ( k ) can be any natural number greater than 1, there are infinitely many choices for ( k ), and thus infinitely many corresponding ( a ) values. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. What if ( k = 1 )? Then ( a = 4 times 1^4 = 4 ). Let's test ( z = n^4 + 4 ). For ( n = 1 ), ( z = 1 + 4 = 5 ), which is prime. Oh, so ( k = 1 ) doesn't work because when ( n = 1 ), ( z ) is prime. Therefore, ( k ) must be greater than 1. So, for ( k > 1 ), ( a = 4k^4 ) ensures that ( z = n^4 + a ) is composite for all ( n ). Since there are infinitely many natural numbers ( k > 1 ), there are indeed infinitely many such ( a ). I think that covers it. I've shown that choosing ( a ) in the form ( 4k^4 ) with ( k > 1 ) makes ( z ) composite for any ( n ), and since there are infinitely many ( k ), there are infinitely many ( a ).**Final Answer**The infinitely many natural numbers ( a ) are given by ( boxed{4k^4} ) for each natural number ( k > 1 )."},{"question":"The hares are cutting the log again, but now both ends of the log are fixed.

This is because each cut increases the number of pieces by one.Applying this principle, if there are 12 pieces, the number of cuts needed is:12 - 1 = 11Therefore, the hares made 11 cuts to achieve the desired number of pieces."},{"question":"A man traveled from the village to the post-office at the rate of 25 kmph and walked back at the rate of 4 kmph. If the whole journey took 5 hours 48 minutes, find the distance of the post-office from the village?","answer":"First, I need to determine the distance between the village and the post-office. The man travels to the post-office at 25 km/h and returns at 4 km/h. The total time for the round trip is 5 hours and 48 minutes.I'll start by converting the total time into hours. Since 48 minutes is 0.8 hours, the total time is 5.8 hours.Next, I'll set up an equation where the time taken to go to the post-office plus the time taken to return equals the total time. Let ( D ) represent the distance to the post-office.The time to travel to the post-office is ( frac{D}{25} ) hours, and the time to return is ( frac{D}{4} ) hours. Adding these together gives:[frac{D}{25} + frac{D}{4} = 5.8]To solve for ( D ), I'll find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 100:[frac{4D}{100} + frac{25D}{100} = 5.8]Combining the terms:[frac{29D}{100} = 5.8]Multiplying both sides by 100:[29D = 580]Finally, dividing both sides by 29:[D = frac{580}{29} = 20]So, the distance from the village to the post-office is 20 kilometers."},{"question":"Angles C and D are supplementary.

That means they add up to 180 degrees, right? And it also says that the measure of angle C is 9 times that of angle D. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the measure of angle C.Let me think about how to approach this. Since they are supplementary, their measures add up to 180 degrees. So if I let the measure of angle D be some value, then angle C would be 9 times that value. Maybe I can set up an equation to solve for the measure of angle D first, and then find angle C.Let me assign a variable to angle D. Let's say angle D is equal to x degrees. Then, according to the problem, angle C would be 9 times x, so that's 9x degrees. Now, since they are supplementary, their sum should be 180 degrees. So I can write the equation:x + 9x = 180Combining like terms, that would be:10x = 180To find the value of x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:x = 180 / 10x = 18So, angle D is 18 degrees. But the question asks for the measure of angle C, which is 9 times angle D. So I multiply 18 by 9:9 * 18 = 162Therefore, angle C is 162 degrees.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If angle D is 18 degrees, then angle C is 9 times that, which is 162 degrees. Adding them together: 18 + 162 = 180 degrees, which confirms that they are supplementary. So, it looks like my answer is correct."},{"question":"In an examination, a certain percentage of the students passed and 520 failed. A total of 800 students appeared for the examination.

I can use the formula for percentage:Percentage = (Number of students who passed / Total number of students) √ó 100.Plugging in the numbers:Percentage = (280 / 800) √ó 100 = 0.35 √ó 100 = 35%.Therefore, 35% of the students passed the examination."},{"question":"If 4^{2x} + 16 = 18left(4^{x}right), determine the value of (x^2 + 4).A) 2B) 4C) 8D) 12E) 4 or 8","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: 4^(2x) + 16 = 18*(4^x). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me think... I remember that 4 is 2 squared, so maybe I can rewrite everything in terms of 2 to make it easier? Or perhaps there's a substitution I can use.Wait, another thought: 4^(2x) is the same as (4^x)^2, right? Because when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So, 4^(2x) = (4^x)^2. That seems useful. Maybe I can let u = 4^x to make the equation look simpler.Let me try that substitution. If u = 4^x, then 4^(2x) = u^2. So, substituting into the equation, I get:u^2 + 16 = 18uHmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of u. Maybe I can rearrange it to standard quadratic form. Let's subtract 18u from both sides:u^2 - 18u + 16 = 0Okay, so now I have a quadratic equation: u^2 - 18u + 16 = 0. I need to solve for u. I can try factoring, but I'm not sure if this factors nicely. Let me check the discriminant to see if it can be factored or if I need to use the quadratic formula.The discriminant D is b^2 - 4ac, where a = 1, b = -18, and c = 16. So,D = (-18)^2 - 4*1*16 = 324 - 64 = 260Hmm, 260 isn't a perfect square, so factoring might not be straightforward. Maybe I should use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is u = [-b ¬± sqrt(D)] / (2a). Plugging in the values:u = [18 ¬± sqrt(260)] / 2Simplify sqrt(260). Let's see, 260 = 4*65, so sqrt(260) = 2*sqrt(65). Therefore,u = [18 ¬± 2*sqrt(65)] / 2 = 9 ¬± sqrt(65)So, u = 9 + sqrt(65) or u = 9 - sqrt(65). But u was defined as 4^x, so we have:4^x = 9 + sqrt(65) or 4^x = 9 - sqrt(65)Hmm, now I need to solve for x in each case. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for x.For the first equation:ln(4^x) = ln(9 + sqrt(65))Using the logarithm power rule, x*ln(4) = ln(9 + sqrt(65))So, x = ln(9 + sqrt(65)) / ln(4)Similarly, for the second equation:ln(4^x) = ln(9 - sqrt(65))Again, x*ln(4) = ln(9 - sqrt(65))So, x = ln(9 - sqrt(65)) / ln(4)Wait a minute, let me check if 9 - sqrt(65) is positive because 4^x is always positive, so the right-hand side must be positive.Calculate sqrt(65): sqrt(64) is 8, so sqrt(65) is approximately 8.0623. Therefore, 9 - 8.0623 ‚âà 0.9377, which is positive. So both solutions are valid.Now, I need to find x^2 + 4 for each solution of x.First, let's compute x when 4^x = 9 + sqrt(65):x = ln(9 + sqrt(65)) / ln(4)Let me approximate this value to understand it better. Let's compute 9 + sqrt(65):sqrt(65) ‚âà 8.0623, so 9 + 8.0623 ‚âà 17.0623So, ln(17.0623) ‚âà 2.837ln(4) ‚âà 1.386So, x ‚âà 2.837 / 1.386 ‚âà 2.04So, x ‚âà 2.04Then, x^2 + 4 ‚âà (2.04)^2 + 4 ‚âà 4.16 + 4 ‚âà 8.16Hmm, that's approximately 8.16, which is close to 8.Now, for the second solution:x = ln(9 - sqrt(65)) / ln(4)Compute 9 - sqrt(65) ‚âà 9 - 8.0623 ‚âà 0.9377So, ln(0.9377) ‚âà -0.0645ln(4) ‚âà 1.386So, x ‚âà -0.0645 / 1.386 ‚âà -0.0465So, x ‚âà -0.0465Then, x^2 + 4 ‚âà (-0.0465)^2 + 4 ‚âà 0.00216 + 4 ‚âà 4.00216That's approximately 4.002, which is very close to 4.So, the two possible values for x^2 + 4 are approximately 8.16 and 4.002, which are close to 8 and 4, respectively.Looking back at the answer choices: A) 2, B) 4, C) 8, D) 12, E) 4 or 8So, the possible values are 4 and 8, which corresponds to option E.Wait, but in the initial substitution, I got u = 9 ¬± sqrt(65). Let me verify if these are indeed the solutions.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution or solving.

The lengths of AD and BD are 3x and 2x respectively. Find the length of AB.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a quadrilateral ABCD where AB is parallel to CD. The coordinates of the points are given: A is at (0, 0), B is at (2x, 2x), C is at (5x/2, x/2), and D is at (2x, 0). They also tell me that the lengths of AD and BD are 3x and 2x respectively. I need to find the length of AB.First, let me visualize this quadrilateral. Since AB is parallel to CD, it must be a trapezoid. I remember that in a trapezoid, the two sides that are parallel are called the bases. So, AB and CD are the bases here.Given the coordinates, I can plot these points on a coordinate plane to get a better idea. Point A is at the origin, which is (0,0). Point B is at (2x, 2x), so that's somewhere in the first quadrant, moving 2x units to the right and 2x units up. Point D is at (2x, 0), which is directly to the right of A on the x-axis. Point C is at (5x/2, x/2), which is a bit more to the right and a bit up from D.Since AB is parallel to CD, the slopes of AB and CD should be equal. Let me check that. The slope of AB is (2x - 0)/(2x - 0) = 2x/2x = 1. The slope of CD is (x/2 - 0)/(5x/2 - 2x) = (x/2)/(x/2) = 1. Okay, so that confirms AB is parallel to CD.Now, I need to find the length of AB. I can use the distance formula for that. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So, applying that to points A and B:AB = sqrt[(2x - 0)^2 + (2x - 0)^2] = sqrt[(4x^2) + (4x^2)] = sqrt[8x^2] = 2‚àö2 x.Wait, but the problem also gives me the lengths of AD and BD as 3x and 2x respectively. I should verify if these lengths make sense with the coordinates given.Let's calculate AD first. Point A is (0,0) and point D is (2x, 0). So, the distance AD is sqrt[(2x - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = sqrt[4x^2] = 2x. But the problem says AD is 3x. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I do something wrong?Wait, maybe I misread the coordinates. Let me double-check. Point D is at (2x, 0), so yes, the distance from A to D is 2x, but the problem says it's 3x. That doesn't add up. Maybe there's a mistake in the coordinates or in the problem statement?Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the coordinates are given in terms of x, but the lengths AD and BD are also given in terms of x. Maybe I need to solve for x first using the given lengths.Let me try that. If AD is 3x, but according to the coordinates, AD is 2x, then 2x = 3x? That would imply x = 0, which doesn't make sense because then all points would collapse to the origin. Hmm, that can't be right.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating AD. Let me recalculate. Point A is (0,0) and point D is (2x, 0). So, the distance is sqrt[(2x - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = sqrt[4x^2] = 2x. So, yes, AD is 2x, but the problem says it's 3x. That suggests that either the coordinates are incorrect, or the lengths are given differently.Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are correct, and the lengths AD and BD are given as 3x and 2x, so I need to find x such that AD = 3x and BD = 2x. But from the coordinates, AD is 2x, so 2x = 3x implies x = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.Wait, maybe the coordinates are not given in terms of x, but rather in terms of some variable, and x is a parameter. So, perhaps I need to solve for x such that AD = 3x and BD = 2x.Let me try that approach. Let's denote the coordinates as given, but treat x as a variable to solve for.First, calculate AD. Point A is (0,0), point D is (2x, 0). So, distance AD is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2] = 2x. According to the problem, AD = 3x. Therefore, 2x = 3x => x = 0. Again, that's impossible because x can't be zero.Hmm, this suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting something. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are not in terms of x, but rather, x is a scaling factor. Let me think.Wait, perhaps the coordinates are given in terms of x, but the lengths AD and BD are given in terms of another variable, say k. But the problem states that AD = 3x and BD = 2x, so they are in terms of x. This is confusing.Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are correct, and the lengths AD and BD are given as 3x and 2x, but x is a different variable. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coordinates are already in terms of x.I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try calculating BD and see if that helps.Point B is (2x, 2x), point D is (2x, 0). So, distance BD is sqrt[(2x - 2x)^2 + (0 - 2x)^2] = sqrt[0 + ( -2x)^2] = sqrt[4x^2] = 2x. According to the problem, BD is 2x, so that's consistent. But AD is given as 3x, but from coordinates, it's 2x. So, there's a conflict.Wait, maybe the coordinates are correct, and the lengths AD and BD are given as 3x and 2x, but x is a different variable. So, perhaps I need to solve for x such that 2x (from AD) equals 3x (given), which would imply x = 0, but that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the coordinates.Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are given in terms of another variable, say t, and x is a different variable. But the problem states the coordinates as (0,0), (2x, 2x), etc., so x is the same variable.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the coordinates are given in terms of x, but the lengths AD and BD are given in terms of another variable, say k, but the problem states they are 3x and 2x. So, perhaps I need to find x such that AD = 3x and BD = 2x, but from coordinates, AD is 2x and BD is 2x. So, 2x = 3x implies x = 0, which is impossible.This is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's assume that the coordinates are correct, and the lengths AD and BD are given as 3x and 2x, but x is a different variable. So, perhaps I need to find the value of x such that AD = 3x and BD = 2x, given the coordinates.Wait, but from the coordinates, AD is 2x, so 2x = 3x => x = 0, which is impossible.

Maybe I should try to calculate AB directly, ignoring the given lengths, and see what I get. From the coordinates, AB is from (0,0) to (2x, 2x), so distance is sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2x)^2] = sqrt[8x^2] = 2‚àö2 x. So, AB is 2‚àö2 x.But the problem gives me AD = 3x and BD = 2x, which from coordinates are 2x and 2x respectively. So, unless x = 0, which is impossible, there's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I'm misinterpreting it.Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are given in terms of another variable, say t, and x is a different variable.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with the exponent being another exponent. Let me break it down step by step.First, I remember that the units digit of powers often repeats in cycles. So maybe I can find a pattern in the units digits of powers of 7. Let me list out the units digits of the first few powers of 7:- (7^1 = 7) ‚Üí units digit is 7- (7^2 = 49) ‚Üí units digit is 9- (7^3 = 343) ‚Üí units digit is 3- (7^4 = 2401) ‚Üí units digit is 1Okay, so the units digits are cycling every 4 powers: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then back to 7 again. That means the cycle length is 4. So, to find the units digit of (7^{3^4}), I need to figure out where (3^4) falls in this 4-cycle.Wait, (3^4) is the exponent here. Let me calculate (3^4) first. - (3^1 = 3)- (3^2 = 9)- (3^3 = 27)- (3^4 = 81)So, (3^4 = 81). That means I need to find the units digit of (7^{81}).Since the cycle of units digits for 7 repeats every 4, I can find the remainder when 81 is divided by 4 to see where it lands in the cycle. Let's do that division:81 divided by 4 is 20 with a remainder of 1. So, (81 mod 4 = 1).That means (7^{81}) will have the same units digit as (7^1), which is 7.Wait, let me double-check that. If the cycle is 4, then exponents that are multiples of 4 will end with 1. So, (7^4) ends with 1, (7^8) would also end with 1, and so on. Since 81 is 4 times 20 plus 1, it's like (7^{4*20 + 1}), which is ((7^4)^{20} * 7^1). Since (7^4) ends with 1, raising it to any power still ends with 1, and multiplying by 7 gives a units digit of 7.Yeah, that makes sense. So, the units digit of (7^{3^4}) is 7."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, AB=8, BC=10, AC=6, and D is on overline{AC} such that BD=8. Find the ratio of AD:DC.(A) 0:1(B) 1:1(C) 1:2(D) 1:3(E) 2:1","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:In triangle ABC, AB = 8, BC = 10, AC = 6, and D is on AC such that BD = 8. Find the ratio of AD:DC. The options are (A) 0:1, (B) 1:1, (C) 1:2, (D) 1:3, (E) 2:1.Alright, let's start by drawing triangle ABC. I know the lengths of all sides: AB is 8, BC is 10, and AC is 6. Hmm, so it's a scalene triangle since all sides are different. Now, point D is somewhere on AC, and BD is 8. I need to find the ratio of AD to DC.First, maybe I should check if triangle ABC is a right triangle or not. Let me use the Pythagorean theorem to see if any of the angles are right angles. The sides are 6, 8, 10. Wait, 6-8-10 is a Pythagorean triple because 6¬≤ + 8¬≤ = 36 + 64 = 100, which is 10¬≤. So, triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at B. That means angle B is 90 degrees.Okay, so angle B is 90 degrees. Now, point D is on AC, and BD is 8. Since AB is also 8, maybe triangle ABD is an isosceles triangle? Let me think. If BD is 8 and AB is 8, then triangle ABD has two sides equal: AB and BD. So, triangle ABD is isosceles with AB = BD.But wait, if triangle ABD is isosceles with AB = BD, then the base angles at A and D should be equal. But angle at B is 90 degrees in triangle ABC, so angle ABD is part of that 90 degrees. Hmm, maybe I can use coordinates to solve this problem.Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let's place point B at the origin (0,0). Since AB is 8 and angle B is 90 degrees, let me put point A at (0,8) and point C at (6,0). Wait, hold on. If AB is 8, and AC is 6, but BC is 10. Let me make sure the coordinates make sense.Actually, since ABC is a right triangle at B, AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but AC is given as 6, which is shorter than AB and BC. That can't be right because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. So, maybe I got the sides wrong.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. AB is 8, BC is 10, and AC is 6. So, sides AB = 8, BC = 10, AC = 6. So, the sides are 6, 8, 10, which is a Pythagorean triple. So, the right angle must be at B because AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ = 8¬≤ + 10¬≤ = 64 + 100 = 164, which is not equal to AC¬≤ = 36. Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, no. Hold on, in triangle ABC, sides are AB = 8, BC = 10, AC = 6. So, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are BC = 10, AC = 6, and AB = 8. So, using the Law of Cosines to find angle B.Law of Cosines: c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤ - 2ab cos(C). So, in this case, AC¬≤ = AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle B). Plugging in the numbers: 6¬≤ = 8¬≤ + 10¬≤ - 2*8*10*cos(angle B). So, 36 = 64 + 100 - 160*cos(angle B). So, 36 = 164 - 160*cos(angle B). Then, 160*cos(angle B) = 164 - 36 = 128. So, cos(angle B) = 128 / 160 = 0.8. So, angle B is arccos(0.8). Let me calculate that.Arccos(0.8) is approximately 36.87 degrees. So, angle B is not 90 degrees. Hmm, that changes things. So, triangle ABC is not a right triangle. I thought it was because of the 6-8-10, but apparently, that's not the case because AC is 6, which is the side opposite angle B, so it's not the hypotenuse. So, angle B is approximately 36.87 degrees.Okay, so maybe I need to use the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines to find some angles or sides. Since D is on AC, and BD is 8, which is equal to AB. So, BD = AB = 8. So, triangle ABD has sides AB = 8, BD = 8, and AD is a part of AC.Wait, so triangle ABD is isosceles with AB = BD = 8. So, in triangle ABD, sides AB and BD are equal, so the base angles at A and D are equal. So, angle at A (angle BAD) is equal to angle at D (angle BDA).But I don't know the length of AD yet. Let me denote AD as x, so DC would be AC - AD = 6 - x. So, I need to find x such that BD = 8.Maybe I can use the Law of Cosines in triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, sides AB = 8, BD = 8, and AD = x. So, applying the Law of Cosines:BD¬≤ = AB¬≤ + AD¬≤ - 2*AB*AD*cos(angle BAD)But wait, angle BAD is part of angle BAC in triangle ABC. Maybe I can find angle BAC first.In triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines to find angle BAC:BC¬≤ = AB¬≤ + AC¬≤ - 2*AB*AC*cos(angle BAC)So, 10¬≤ = 8¬≤ + 6¬≤ - 2*8*6*cos(angle BAC)100 = 64 + 36 - 96*cos(angle BAC)100 = 100 - 96*cos(angle BAC)So, 0 = -96*cos(angle BAC)Therefore, cos(angle BAC) = 0, which means angle BAC is 90 degrees.Wait, that's interesting. So, angle BAC is 90 degrees. So, triangle ABC is right-angled at A.Wait, but earlier, I thought angle B was 36.87 degrees. But if angle BAC is 90 degrees, then triangle ABC is right-angled at A, with AB = 8, AC = 6, and BC = 10.Wait, that makes sense because 6-8-10 is a Pythagorean triple. So, AB = 8, AC = 6, and BC = 10, so it's a right triangle at A. So, angle BAC is 90 degrees.So, that clarifies that triangle ABC is right-angled at A, not at B. So, angle BAC is 90 degrees.Okay, so now, point D is on AC such that BD = 8. So, BD is 8, same as AB. So, in triangle ABD, AB = BD = 8, and angle at A is 90 degrees.Wait, so triangle ABD has AB = BD = 8, and angle at A is 90 degrees. So, triangle ABD is an isosceles right triangle? Because two sides are equal and the included angle is 90 degrees.Wait, no. If two sides are equal and the included angle is 90 degrees, then it's an isosceles right triangle, and the other two angles would be 45 degrees each. But in this case, triangle ABD has sides AB = 8, BD = 8, and AD is the other side.Wait, but if angle at A is 90 degrees, then triangle ABD is a right triangle with legs AB and AD, and hypotenuse BD. But BD is given as 8, same as AB.So, in triangle ABD, AB = 8, BD = 8, and angle at A is 90 degrees. So, using Pythagoras theorem:BD¬≤ = AB¬≤ + AD¬≤So, 8¬≤ = 8¬≤ + AD¬≤64 = 64 + AD¬≤So, AD¬≤ = 0, which means AD = 0.Wait, that can't be possible because D is on AC, so AD can't be zero. That would mean D coincides with A, but then BD would be BA, which is 8, but D is on AC, so that would mean D is at A, but AC is 6, so DC would be 6.But that would make AD:DC = 0:6, which simplifies to 0:1, which is option A.But that seems a bit strange. Let me double-check.If triangle ABC is right-angled at A, with AB = 8, AC = 6, and BC = 10. Then, point D is on AC such that BD = 8.So, if I consider point D on AC, then BD is a line from B to D on AC. If BD = 8, same as AB, then triangle ABD has AB = BD = 8, and angle at A is 90 degrees.But in that case, as per Pythagoras, AD would have to be zero, which would place D at A. But then, BD would be BA, which is 8, which is consistent. However, D is supposed to be on AC, so if D is at A, then DC is AC, which is 6, so AD:DC is 0:6, which is 0:1.But is there another possibility? Maybe D is not at A, but somewhere else on AC such that BD = 8.Wait, but if I consider triangle ABD, with AB = 8, BD = 8, and angle at A is 90 degrees, then the only solution is AD = 0. Because in a right triangle with two equal sides, the third side must be zero.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming angle at A is 90 degrees. Wait, earlier, I used the Law of Cosines and found that angle BAC is 90 degrees. Let me verify that again.In triangle ABC, sides AB = 8, AC = 6, BC = 10.Using Law of Cosines to find angle BAC:BC¬≤ = AB¬≤ + AC¬≤ - 2*AB*AC*cos(angle BAC)10¬≤ = 8¬≤ + 6¬≤ - 2*8*6*cos(angle BAC)100 = 64 + 36 - 96*cos(angle BAC)100 = 100 - 96*cos(angle BAC)So, 0 = -96*cos(angle BAC)Therefore, cos(angle BAC) = 0, so angle BAC = 90 degrees.Yes, that's correct. So, angle BAC is indeed 90 degrees.Therefore, triangle ABC is right-angled at A, with AB = 8, AC = 6, and BC = 10.So, point D is on AC such that BD = 8. So, in triangle ABD, AB = 8, BD = 8, and angle at A is 90 degrees.Therefore, triangle ABD is a right triangle with legs AB and AD, and hypotenuse BD.So, BD¬≤ = AB¬≤ + AD¬≤8¬≤ = 8¬≤ + AD¬≤64 = 64 + AD¬≤AD¬≤ = 0AD = 0So, D coincides with A, making AD = 0 and DC = AC = 6.Therefore, the ratio AD:DC is 0:6, which simplifies to 0:1.So, the answer is option A, 0:1.But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Is there another way to interpret the problem? Maybe D is not on AC extended beyond A, but somewhere else.Wait, AC is 6 units long. If D is on AC, then AD can't be more than 6. But in this case, AD is 0, which is at point A.Alternatively, maybe I need to use coordinate geometry to solve this.Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let me place point A at (0,0), since it's the right angle. Then, AB is 8 units, so point B is at (0,8). AC is 6 units, so point C is at (6,0). Then, BC is the hypotenuse from (0,8) to (6,0), which should be 10 units.Let me verify the distance between B(0,8) and C(6,0):Distance = sqrt[(6-0)¬≤ + (0-8)¬≤] = sqrt[36 + 64] = sqrt[100] = 10. Yes, that's correct.Now, point D is on AC. Let me parametrize AC. Since AC is from (0,0) to (6,0), it's along the x-axis. So, any point D on AC can be represented as (x,0), where x is between 0 and 6.We need to find x such that the distance from B(0,8) to D(x,0) is 8.So, distance BD = sqrt[(x - 0)¬≤ + (0 - 8)¬≤] = sqrt[x¬≤ + 64] = 8.So, sqrt[x¬≤ + 64] = 8Squaring both sides: x¬≤ + 64 = 64So, x¬≤ = 0Therefore, x = 0So, point D is at (0,0), which is point A.Therefore, AD = 0, and DC = AC - AD = 6 - 0 = 6.So, the ratio AD:DC is 0:6, which is 0:1.Therefore, the answer is option A, 0:1.Hmm, so both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I think that's correct.But just to make sure, let me think if there's another point D on AC such that BD = 8. But from the coordinate method, the only solution is x = 0, which is point A. So, there's no other point on AC where BD = 8 except at A.Therefore, the ratio is indeed 0:1.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"The Martin family goes to the mall to get ice cream.

Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that 30^k means 30 multiplied by itself k times. Since 30 is 2 times 3 times 5, 30^k would be (2*3*5)^k, which is the same as 2^k * 3^k * 5^k. So, for 30^k to divide 929,260, 929,260 must have at least k factors of 2, k factors of 3, and k factors of 5 in its prime factorization.Alright, so my first task is to factorize 929,260 into its prime components. Let me start by dividing 929,260 by 2 to see how many times 2 is a factor.929,260 divided by 2 is 464,630. Okay, that's one factor of 2. Let's divide 464,630 by 2 again: 464,630 divided by 2 is 232,315. That's two factors of 2. Now, 232,315 doesn't seem to be divisible by 2 because it ends with a 5, which is odd. So, I have 2^2 so far.Next, let's check for factors of 3. I'll add up the digits of 232,315: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 equals 16. Since 16 isn't divisible by 3, 232,315 isn't divisible by 3. Hmm, that's a problem because 30^k requires factors of 3 as well. Maybe I made a mistake in my earlier division?Wait, let me double-check. 929,260 divided by 2 is indeed 464,630, and 464,630 divided by 2 is 232,315. Okay, that's correct. So, 232,315 isn't divisible by 3, which means that 929,260 only has two factors of 2 and no factors of 3 beyond what's already been accounted for.But wait, 30^k requires factors of 2, 3, and 5. If there's no factor of 3 beyond what's already been used, then k can't be more than 1 because 30^1 is 30, which is 2*3*5. But 929,260 doesn't have a factor of 5, does it?Let me check. 232,315 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. Let's divide it by 5: 232,315 divided by 5 is 46,463. Okay, so that's one factor of 5. Now, 46,463 doesn't end with a 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5 anymore. So, 929,260 has one factor of 5.Putting it all together, the prime factorization of 929,260 is 2^2 * 5^1 * 3^0 * ... Wait, but earlier I thought there was a factor of 3. Did I miss something?Let me go back. When I divided 929,260 by 2 twice, I got 232,315. Then I tried dividing by 3 and it didn't work. Maybe I should try dividing by 3 again. Let's see, 232,315 divided by 3: 3 goes into 23 two times, remainder 2; 3 goes into 22 seven times, remainder 1; 3 goes into 13 four times, remainder 1; 3 goes into 11 three times, remainder 2; 3 goes into 25 eight times, remainder 1. So, it doesn't divide evenly. Okay, so no factor of 3.Wait, but 30^k requires factors of 2, 3, and 5. If 929,260 only has two factors of 2, one factor of 5, and no factors of 3, then the highest power of 30 that divides it is 30^0, which is 1, because 30^1 would require at least one factor of 3, which isn't present.But that doesn't make sense because 30^0 is 1, and any number is divisible by 1. So, k could be 0, but the problem says k is a non-negative integer, so k=0 is allowed. But let's check if k=1 is possible.If k=1, then 30^1=30. Does 30 divide 929,260? Well, 30 divides a number if it's divisible by 2, 3, and 5. We've established that 929,260 is divisible by 2 and 5, but not by 3. Therefore, 30 doesn't divide 929,260, so k cannot be 1.Therefore, the highest power of 30 that divides 929,260 is 30^0=1, so k=0.Now, the expression is 3^k - k^3. If k=0, then 3^0=1 and 0^3=0, so 1 - 0=1.Wait, but earlier I thought k=1 might be possible, but it's not because 30 doesn't divide 929,260. So, k=0 is the only possibility.But let me double-check my factorization. Maybe I missed a factor of 3 somewhere.Starting again: 929,260 divided by 2 is 464,630. Divided by 2 again is 232,315. Divided by 5 is 46,463. Now, 46,463: let's check divisibility by 3. 4+6+4+6+3=23, which isn't divisible by 3. How about 7? 46,463 divided by 7: 7*6=42, remainder 4; 7*6=42, remainder 4; 7*6=42, remainder 4; 7*6=42, remainder 4; 7*6=42, remainder 4. So, not divisible by 7.Next prime is 11: 46,463 divided by 11: 11*4=44, remainder 2; 11*2=22, remainder 4; 11*4=44, remainder 2; 11*2=22, remainder 4; 11*4=44, remainder 2. Not divisible by 11.Next is 13: 13*3=39, remainder 7; 13*5=65, remainder 1; 13*3=39, remainder 7; 13*5=65, remainder 1; 13*3=39, remainder 7. Not divisible by 13.Continuing like this would take too long, but it seems 46,463 is a prime number or at least doesn't have small factors. So, the prime factorization of 929,260 is indeed 2^2 * 5^1 * 46,463.Therefore, the highest power of 30 that divides 929,260 is 30^0=1, so k=0.Thus, the expression 3^k - k^3 becomes 3^0 - 0^3=1-0=1.Wait, but earlier I thought k=1 might be possible, but it's not because 30 doesn't divide 929,260. So, k=0 is the only possibility.But let me check if 30^1 divides 929,260. 30^1=30. 929,260 divided by 30 is 30,975.333... which isn't an integer, so 30 doesn't divide 929,260 evenly. Therefore, k=0 is the only valid value.So, the result of the expression is 1."},{"question":"What is the molecular weight of 5 moles of Calcium iodide?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out the molecular weight of 5 moles of calcium iodide. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that molecular weight is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in a molecule. Calcium iodide is CaI‚ÇÇ, right? So, there's one calcium atom and two iodine atoms in each molecule.First, I need to find the atomic weights of calcium and iodine. I think calcium has an atomic weight of about 40.08 g/mol. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll go with that for now. Iodine, on the other hand, has a higher atomic weight. I believe it's around 126.90 g/mol. Okay, so if there are two iodine atoms in calcium iodide, I need to multiply the atomic weight of iodine by 2.So, the molecular weight of calcium iodide would be the atomic weight of calcium plus twice the atomic weight of iodine. Let me write that down:Molecular weight of CaI‚ÇÇ = Atomic weight of Ca + (2 √ó Atomic weight of I)Molecular weight of CaI‚ÇÇ = 40.08 g/mol + (2 √ó 126.90 g/mol)Now, calculating that:2 √ó 126.90 g/mol = 253.80 g/molAdding that to the atomic weight of calcium:40.08 g/mol + 253.80 g/mol = 293.88 g/molSo, the molecular weight of calcium iodide is 293.88 g/mol.But the question asks for the molecular weight of 5 moles of calcium iodide. Wait, molecular weight is per mole, right? So, if I have 5 moles, I need to multiply the molecular weight by 5 to get the total weight.Total weight = Molecular weight of CaI‚ÇÇ √ó Number of molesTotal weight = 293.88 g/mol √ó 5 molesCalculating that:293.88 g/mol √ó 5 = 1469.4 gSo, the total weight of 5 moles of calcium iodide is 1469.4 grams.Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. Calcium is 40.08, iodine is 126.90, and there are two iodines. So, 40.08 + 253.80 = 293.88. Yeah, that seems right. Then multiplying by 5 gives 1469.4 grams. Okay, I think that's correct."},{"question":"Let A and B be two points on the hyperbola x^{2}-frac{y^2}{9}=1. Among the following four points, the one that can be the midpoint of the line segment AB is:A: (1,1)B: (-1,2)C: (1,3)D: (-1,-4)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given points can be the midpoint of a line segment AB, where both A and B lie on the hyperbola defined by the equation ( x^2 - frac{y^2}{9} = 1 ). The options are A: (1,1), B: (-1,2), C: (1,3), and D: (-1,-4). First, I remember that if M is the midpoint of AB, then the coordinates of M can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of A and B. Specifically, if A is ((x_1, y_1)) and B is ((x_2, y_2)), then the midpoint M is (left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right)). Since both A and B lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation ( x^2 - frac{y^2}{9} = 1 ). So, for point A, we have ( x_1^2 - frac{y_1^2}{9} = 1 ), and for point B, ( x_2^2 - frac{y_2^2}{9} = 1 ).I think a good approach here is to use the concept of the midpoint and the equation of the hyperbola to find out whether such points A and B exist for each given midpoint. Maybe I can use the midpoint formula and the equation of the hyperbola to derive some conditions.Let me denote the midpoint as ( M(x_0, y_0) ). Then, ( x_0 = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} ) and ( y_0 = frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} ). So, ( x_1 + x_2 = 2x_0 ) and ( y_1 + y_2 = 2y_0 ).Now, since both A and B lie on the hyperbola, subtracting their equations gives ( x_1^2 - x_2^2 - frac{y_1^2 - y_2^2}{9} = 0 ). This can be factored as ( (x_1 - x_2)(x_1 + x_2) - frac{(y_1 - y_2)(y_1 + y_2)}{9} = 0 ).Substituting ( x_1 + x_2 = 2x_0 ) and ( y_1 + y_2 = 2y_0 ), we get ( (x_1 - x_2)(2x_0) - frac{(y_1 - y_2)(2y_0)}{9} = 0 ). Dividing both sides by 2, we have ( (x_1 - x_2)x_0 - frac{(y_1 - y_2)y_0}{9} = 0 ).Let me denote the slope of the line AB as ( m = frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} ). Then, substituting this into the equation, we get ( (x_1 - x_2)x_0 - frac{(m(x_1 - x_2))y_0}{9} = 0 ). Factoring out ( (x_1 - x_2) ), we have ( (x_1 - x_2)left( x_0 - frac{m y_0}{9} right) = 0 ).Since ( x_1 neq x_2 ) (otherwise, the line AB would be vertical, and the midpoint might not necessarily satisfy the condition), we can divide both sides by ( (x_1 - x_2) ), resulting in ( x_0 - frac{m y_0}{9} = 0 ). Therefore, ( m = frac{9x_0}{y_0} ).So, the slope of the line AB is ( frac{9x_0}{y_0} ). This gives us the slope in terms of the midpoint coordinates. Now, knowing the slope and the midpoint, we can write the equation of the line AB. The equation of a line with slope ( m ) passing through point ( M(x_0, y_0) ) is ( y - y_0 = m(x - x_0) ). Substituting ( m = frac{9x_0}{y_0} ), the equation becomes ( y - y_0 = frac{9x_0}{y_0}(x - x_0) ).Simplifying this, we get ( y = frac{9x_0}{y_0}x - frac{9x_0^2}{y_0} + y_0 ). Now, since points A and B lie on both the hyperbola and the line AB, we can substitute the expression for ( y ) from the line equation into the hyperbola equation to find the x-coordinates of A and B. Substituting ( y = frac{9x_0}{y_0}x - frac{9x_0^2}{y_0} + y_0 ) into ( x^2 - frac{y^2}{9} = 1 ), we get:( x^2 - frac{left( frac{9x_0}{y_0}x - frac{9x_0^2}{y_0} + y_0 right)^2}{9} = 1 ).This equation will give us a quadratic in terms of ( x ). For points A and B to exist, this quadratic must have real solutions, meaning the discriminant must be non-negative.So, for each given midpoint, I need to:1. Calculate the slope ( m = frac{9x_0}{y_0} ).2. Write the equation of the line AB.3. Substitute this into the hyperbola equation to get a quadratic in ( x ).4. Calculate the discriminant of this quadratic.5. If the discriminant is non-negative, then such points A and B exist, meaning the midpoint is possible.Let me apply this step-by-step for each option.**Option A: (1,1)**1. ( x_0 = 1 ), ( y_0 = 1 )2.

Calculate discriminant ( D = (-144)^2 - 4(72)(73) )   ( D = 20736 - 4(72)(73) )   Compute ( 4*72 = 288 ), then ( 288*73 )   Let me compute 288*70=20160 and 288*3=864, so total is 20160+864=21024   So, ( D = 20736 - 21024 = -288 )   Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions. Therefore, point A cannot be the midpoint.**Option B: (-1,2)**1. ( x_0 = -1 ), ( y_0 = 2 )2. Slope ( m = frac{9*(-1)}{2} = -frac{9}{2} )3.

Substitute into hyperbola:   ( x^2 - frac{left(-frac{9}{2}x - frac{5}{2}right)^2}{9} = 1 )   Expand the square:   ( x^2 - frac{left(frac{81}{4}x^2 + frac{45}{2}x + frac{25}{4}right)}{9} = 1 )   Simplify each term:   ( x^2 - left( frac{81}{36}x^2 + frac{45}{18}x + frac{25}{36} right) = 1 )   Simplify fractions:   ( x^2 - left( frac{9}{4}x^2 + frac{5}{2}x + frac{25}{36} right) = 1 )   Distribute the negative sign:   ( x^2 - frac{9}{4}x^2 - frac{5}{2}x - frac{25}{36} = 1 )   Combine like terms:   ( -frac{5}{4}x^2 - frac{5}{2}x - frac{25}{36} - 1 = 0 )   Multiply through by 36 to eliminate denominators:   ( -45x^2 - 90x - 25 - 36 = 0 )   Simplify:   ( -45x^2 - 90x - 61 = 0 )   Multiply both sides by -1:   ( 45x^2 + 90x + 61 = 0 )5. Calculate discriminant ( D = 90^2 - 4*45*61 )   ( D = 8100 - 4*45*61 )   Compute 4*45=180, then 180*61   180*60=10800, 180*1=180, so total is 10800+180=10980   So, ( D = 8100 - 10980 = -2880 )   Again, the discriminant is negative, so no real solutions. Therefore, point B cannot be the midpoint.**Option C: (1,3)**1. ( x_0 = 1 ), ( y_0 = 3 )2. Slope ( m = frac{9*1}{3} = 3 )3. Equation of line AB: ( y - 3 = 3(x - 1) ) ‚Üí ( y = 3x )4. Substitute into hyperbola:   ( x^2 - frac{(3x)^2}{9} = 1 )   Simplify:   ( x^2 - frac{9x^2}{9} = 1 )   ( x^2 - x^2 = 1 )   ( 0 = 1 )   This is a contradiction, meaning there are no points of intersection. Therefore, point C cannot be the midpoint.**Option D: (-1,-4)**1. ( x_0 = -1 ), ( y_0 = -4 )2. Slope ( m = frac{9*(-1)}{-4} = frac{9}{4} )3.

Calculate discriminant ( D = 126^2 - 4*63*(-193) )   ( D = 15876 + 4*63*193 )   Compute 4*63=252, then 252*193   Let me compute 252*200=50400, subtract 252*7=1764, so 50400 - 1764=48636   So, ( D = 15876 + 48636 = 64512 )   Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. Therefore, point D can be the midpoint.So, after checking all options, only option D satisfies the condition that the midpoint lies on the hyperbola such that there exist two points A and B on the hyperbola with D as their midpoint.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = begin{cases} x+2 & (xleq-1)  x^{2} & (-1<x<2)  2x & (xgeq2)end{cases}.1. Find the values of f(-4), f(3), and f[f(-2)].2. If f(a) = 0, find the value of a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined in three different pieces. It's a piecewise function, which means the expression for f(x) changes depending on the value of x. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:f(x) = - x + 2, when x ‚â§ -1- x¬≤, when -1 < x < 2- 2x, when x ‚â• 2Alright, so for part 1, I need to find f(-4), f(3), and f[f(-2)]. Let's take these one at a time.First, f(-4). Since -4 is less than or equal to -1, I should use the first piece of the function, which is f(x) = x + 2. So, plugging in -4, I get f(-4) = (-4) + 2 = -2. That seems straightforward.Next, f(3). Here, 3 is greater than or equal to 2, so I use the third piece of the function, which is f(x) = 2x. Plugging in 3, I get f(3) = 2 * 3 = 6. That also seems straightforward.Now, the tricky one is f[f(-2)]. This is a composition of functions, meaning I have to first find f(-2) and then plug that result back into f(x). Let's start with f(-2). Since -2 is less than or equal to -1, I use the first piece again, f(x) = x + 2. So, f(-2) = (-2) + 2 = 0.Now, I need to find f(0). Looking back at the function, 0 is between -1 and 2, so I use the second piece, which is f(x) = x¬≤. Plugging in 0, I get f(0) = 0¬≤ = 0. So, f[f(-2)] = f(0) = 0.Okay, so that takes care of part 1. Now, moving on to part 2: If f(a) = 0, find the value of a.Hmm, this means I need to find all values of a such that when I plug a into f(x), I get 0. Since f(x) is piecewise, I need to check each piece separately to see if there are any solutions.First, let's consider the first piece: f(x) = x + 2 for x ‚â§ -1. If f(a) = 0, then:a + 2 = 0a = -2Now, I need to check if a = -2 satisfies the condition x ‚â§ -1. Since -2 ‚â§ -1, this solution is valid.Next, let's look at the second piece: f(x) = x¬≤ for -1 < x < 2. If f(a) = 0, then:a¬≤ = 0a = 0Now, check if a = 0 satisfies the condition -1 < x < 2. Yes, 0 is between -1 and 2, so this is also a valid solution.Finally, the third piece: f(x) = 2x for x ‚â• 2. If f(a) = 0, then:2a = 0a = 0But wait, a = 0 does not satisfy the condition x ‚â• 2. So, this solution is not valid.Therefore, the solutions are a = -2 and a = 0.Wait a second, in my initial thought process, I considered both a = -2 and a = 0 as solutions. But in the original problem statement, it just says \\"find the value of a,\\" which might imply there's only one solution. However, based on the function, there are two solutions: a = -2 and a = 0.But looking back at the function, when a = 0, it falls into the second piece, which is x¬≤, and indeed, 0¬≤ = 0. So, both solutions are valid.However, in the initial solution provided, it only mentions a = 0, which seems to overlook a = -2. Maybe there was a mistake there.So, to summarize:1. f(-4) = -2, f(3) = 6, and f[f(-2)] = 0.2. The values of a that satisfy f(a) = 0 are a = -2 and a = 0.But since the problem asks for \\"the value of a,\\" it might expect both solutions. Alternatively, if it's expecting a single value, perhaps only a = 0 is intended, but mathematically, both are correct.I think it's important to note both solutions to be thorough."},{"question":"For the function f(x) = asin x + bx^3 + 1, where a, b in mathbb{R}, choose a set of values for a and b to calculate f(1) and f(-1).

The options are A: 4 and 6, B: 3 and -3, C: 2 and 4, D: 1 and 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I should probably write down what f(1) and f(-1) would be in terms of a and b. Let me compute f(1):f(1) = a sin(1) + b*(1)¬≥ + 1. Simplifying that, it's a sin(1) + b + 1.Similarly, f(-1) would be a sin(-1) + b*(-1)¬≥ + 1. Since sin(-1) is -sin(1) and (-1)¬≥ is -1, that becomes -a sin(1) - b + 1.So, f(1) = a sin(1) + b + 1 and f(-1) = -a sin(1) - b + 1.Now, if I add f(1) and f(-1) together, the a sin(1) and -a sin(1) terms cancel out, as do the b and -b terms. So f(1) + f(-1) = 2. That's interesting. So regardless of the values of a and b, the sum of f(1) and f(-1) is always 2.Looking at the options given, let's check each pair to see if their sum is 2.Option A: 4 and 6. 4 + 6 = 10. That's way more than 2. So A can't be correct.Option B: 3 and -3. 3 + (-3) = 0. That's less than 2. So B is out.Option C: 2 and 4. 2 + 4 = 6. Still more than 2.

Sin(1) is approximately 0.8415, so that's roughly 0.8415 + 1 + 1 = 2.8415.Similarly, f(-1) = -1*sin(1) + (-1) + 1. That's approximately -0.8415 -1 + 1 = -0.8415.Wait, but the options are just giving two numbers, 4 and 6, 3 and -3, etc. So maybe they're not giving f(1) and f(-1) directly but the values of a and b?

The question says \\"the correct result can only be: A: 4 and 6, B: 3 and -3, etc.\\" So perhaps each option is a possible pair of f(1) and f(-1). But earlier, I found that f(1) + f(-1) must equal 2. So let's check each option:A: 4 and 6. 4 + 6 = 10 ‚â† 2. So A is invalid.B: 3 and -3. 3 + (-3) = 0 ‚â† 2. So B is invalid.C: 2 and 4. 2 + 4 = 6 ‚â† 2. So C is invalid.D: 1 and 1. 1 + 1 = 2. That works.So the only possible correct result is D: 1 and 1, meaning f(1)=1 and f(-1)=1.But wait, if f(1)=1 and f(-1)=1, then let's see what a and b would be.From f(1)=1: a sin(1) + b + 1 =1 ‚áí a sin(1) + b =0.From f(-1)=1: -a sin(1) - b +1=1 ‚áí -a sin(1) - b=0.So we have two equations:1) a sin(1) + b =02) -a sin(1) - b =0If we add these two equations: (a sin(1) + b) + (-a sin(1) - b) =0 +0 ‚áí 0=0. So they are dependent.Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: (a sin(1) + b) - (-a sin(1) - b) =0 -0 ‚áí 2a sin(1) + 2b=0 ‚áí a sin(1) + b=0, which is the same as equation 1.So we have one equation with two variables. That means there are infinitely many solutions for a and b. But the question is asking to choose a set of values for a and b from the options given. Wait, but the options are for f(1) and f(-1), not a and b. Hmm, maybe I misread.Wait, the question says: \\"choose a set of values for a and b to calculate f(1) and f(-1). The correct result can only be: A: 4 and 6, B: 3 and -3, C: 2 and 4, D: 1 and 1.\\"So the options are possible pairs of f(1) and f(-1). So we need to find which pair among A to D is possible given the function f(x)=a sin x + b x¬≥ +1.As I found earlier, f(1) + f(-1)=2. So the sum of the two numbers in the correct option must be 2.Looking at the options:A: 4 and 6. Sum=10‚â†2.B: 3 and -3. Sum=0‚â†2.C: 2 and 4. Sum=6‚â†2.D:1 and1. Sum=2.

I need to find the dot product of vectors ( overrightarrow{OA} ) and ( overrightarrow{OB} ), where ( O ) is the origin.Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I should probably figure out the equation of the line ( l ). Since it passes through ( P(0, 2) ), which is on the y-axis, I can write the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form, which is ( y = mx + b ). Here, ( b ) is the y-intercept, which is 2 because the line passes through ( (0, 2) ).

To find the points of intersection, I can set the equations equal to each other:( frac{1}{4}x^2 = mx + 2 )Let me rewrite that equation to make it easier to solve:( frac{1}{4}x^2 - mx - 2 = 0 )Hmm, to make it a standard quadratic equation, I can multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:( x^2 - 4mx - 8 = 0 )Okay, so now I have a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ):( x^2 - 4mx - 8 = 0 )This quadratic equation will have two solutions, corresponding to the x-coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ). Let me denote these solutions as ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). From Vieta's formulas, I know that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots ( x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} ) and the product ( x_1x_2 = frac{c}{a} ).Applying this to my equation:Sum of roots: ( x_1 + x_2 = frac{4m}{1} = 4m )Product of roots: ( x_1x_2 = frac{-8}{1} = -8 )Alright, so I have ( x_1 + x_2 = 4m ) and ( x_1x_2 = -8 ).Now, I need to find the coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ). Since ( A ) and ( B ) lie on both the parabola and the line, their coordinates satisfy both equations. So, for each ( x ), the corresponding ( y ) can be found using either equation. Let me use the parabola equation ( y = frac{1}{4}x^2 ) to find ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ):( y_1 = frac{1}{4}x_1^2 )( y_2 = frac{1}{4}x_2^2 )Alternatively, I could have used the line equation ( y = mx + 2 ), but I think using the parabola equation is fine here.Now, the vectors ( overrightarrow{OA} ) and ( overrightarrow{OB} ) can be represented as ( (x_1, y_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2) ) respectively. The dot product of these two vectors is given by:( overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 )So, I need to compute ( x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 ).I already know ( x_1x_2 = -8 ), so that's part of the dot product. Now, I need to find ( y_1y_2 ).Let me compute ( y_1y_2 ):( y_1y_2 = left( frac{1}{4}x_1^2 right) left( frac{1}{4}x_2^2 right) = frac{1}{16}x_1^2x_2^2 )Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since ( y_1 = mx_1 + 2 ) and ( y_2 = mx_2 + 2 ), I can write:( y_1y_2 = (mx_1 + 2)(mx_2 + 2) )Let me expand this:( y_1y_2 = m^2x_1x_2 + 2m(x_1 + x_2) + 4 )That's better because I already know ( x_1x_2 ) and ( x_1 + x_2 ) from earlier.Plugging in the known values:( y_1y_2 = m^2(-8) + 2m(4m) + 4 )Simplify each term:First term: ( -8m^2 )Second term: ( 8m^2 )Third term: ( 4 )So, adding them up:( -8m^2 + 8m^2 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 )Wait, so ( y_1y_2 = 4 ). Interesting, that's a constant, independent of ( m ).Now, going back to the dot product:( overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = (-8) + 4 = -4 )So, the dot product is ( -4 ).Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Equation of the line: ( y = mx + 2 ). Correct, since it passes through (0,2).2. Intersection with parabola: ( frac{1}{4}x^2 = mx + 2 ). Correct.3. Multiplying by 4: ( x^2 - 4mx - 8 = 0 ). Correct.4. Vieta's formulas: sum ( 4m ), product ( -8 ). Correct.5. Expressing ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ) using the line equation: ( y = mx + 2 ). Correct.6. Expanding ( y_1y_2 ): ( (mx_1 + 2)(mx_2 + 2) ). Correct.7. Substituting sum and product: ( m^2(-8) + 2m(4m) + 4 ). Correct.8. Simplifying: ( -8m^2 + 8m^2 + 4 = 4 ). Correct.9. Adding ( x_1x_2 = -8 ) and ( y_1y_2 = 4 ): ( -8 + 4 = -4 ). Correct.Everything seems to check out. So, the dot product is indeed ( -4 ).I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using parametric equations or something else, but I think the method I used is straightforward and effective. It's interesting that the dot product comes out to be a constant, regardless of the slope ( m ) of the line. That suggests that no matter how the line is drawn through ( P(0, 2) ), as long as it intersects the parabola at two points ( A ) and ( B ), the dot product ( overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} ) remains the same. That's a neat property!Another thought: maybe this result is related to some geometric property of the parabola. I know that in some cases, certain products or sums remain constant due to the nature of the conic section. It might be worth exploring why this particular dot product is constant, but for the purpose of this problem, I think the algebraic approach suffices.In summary, by setting up the equations, finding the roots, and computing the necessary products, I arrived at the conclusion that the dot product is ( -4 ). I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I feel confident about this answer."},{"question":"If a person walks at 6 km/h instead of 3 km/h, he would have walked 15 km more. What is the actual distance traveled by him?","answer":"First, I need to determine the time spent walking. Let's denote the time as ( t ) hours.When walking at 3 km/h, the distance covered is ( 3t ) km.When walking at 6 km/h, the distance covered is ( 6t ) km.According to the problem, walking at 6 km/h results in 15 km more than walking at 3 km/h. This gives the equation:[ 6t = 3t + 15 ]Solving for ( t ):[ 6t - 3t = 15 ][ 3t = 15 ][ t = 5 ]So, the time spent walking is 5 hours.Now, calculate the actual distance traveled at 3 km/h:[ text{Distance} = 3 text{ km/h} times 5 text{ h} = 15 text{ km} ]Therefore, the actual distance traveled is 15 km."},{"question":"Given the set A={x|ax^2-5x+6=0}, if there is at least one element in A, then the range of values for a is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Given the set ( A = {x mid ax^2 - 5x + 6 = 0} ), if there is at least one element in ( A ), then what is the range of values for ( a )? Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what the set ( A ) represents. It's the set of all real numbers ( x ) that satisfy the equation ( ax^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 ). So, depending on the value of ( a ), this equation can have different numbers of solutions. The problem states that there is at least one element in ( A ), which means the equation must have at least one real solution. So, I need to find all values of ( a ) for which this equation has at least one real root.Now, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the discriminant ( Delta ) determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is given by ( Delta = b^2 - 4ac ). If ( Delta > 0 ), there are two distinct real roots; if ( Delta = 0 ), there is exactly one real root (a repeated root); and if ( Delta < 0 ), there are no real roots, only complex ones.In this problem, we want at least one real root, so we need ( Delta geq 0 ). Let's calculate the discriminant for the given equation ( ax^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 ). Here, ( a ) is the coefficient of ( x^2 ), ( b = -5 ), and ( c = 6 ). Plugging these into the discriminant formula:[Delta = (-5)^2 - 4(a)(6) = 25 - 24a]So, for the equation to have at least one real root, we need:[25 - 24a geq 0]Let's solve this inequality for ( a ):[25 - 24a geq 0 -24a geq -25 ]Now, when I divide both sides by -24, I have to remember that dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. So,[a leq frac{25}{24}]Okay, so that tells me that ( a ) must be less than or equal to ( frac{25}{24} ) for the equation to have at least one real root. But wait, I should also consider the case when ( a = 0 ). If ( a = 0 ), the equation becomes linear:[0x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 -5x + 6 = 0 x = frac{6}{5}]So, when ( a = 0 ), the equation still has exactly one real solution, ( x = frac{6}{5} ). Therefore, ( a = 0 ) is also a valid value that satisfies the condition of having at least one element in set ( A ).Putting it all together, the values of ( a ) that satisfy the condition are all real numbers less than or equal to ( frac{25}{24} ). This includes ( a = 0 ) and all negative values of ( a ) as well. So, the range of ( a ) is from negative infinity up to ( frac{25}{24} ).Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me recap:1. If ( a neq 0 ), the equation is quadratic, and the discriminant must be non-negative for real roots. This gives ( a leq frac{25}{24} ).2. If ( a = 0 ), the equation is linear and has exactly one real root.Therefore, combining both cases, the range of ( a ) is all real numbers ( a ) such that ( a leq frac{25}{24} ).I think that covers everything. I don't see any other cases or special conditions that I might have overlooked. So, I'm confident that the range of ( a ) is ( (-infty, frac{25}{24}] ).**Final Answer**The range of values for ( a ) is boxed{(-infty, frac{25}{24}]}."},{"question":"If the surface area of a cone is 3pi, and its lateral surface unfolds into a semicircle, then the diameter of the base of the cone is ___.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a cone. The surface area is given as 3œÄ, and the lateral surface, when unfolded, forms a semicircle. I need to find the diameter of the base of the cone. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that a cone has two main parts: the base, which is a circle, and the lateral surface, which is like the side that tapers up to the tip. The surface area of a cone is the sum of the area of the base and the lateral surface area. The formula for the total surface area (SA) of a cone is:SA = œÄr¬≤ + œÄrlWhere r is the radius of the base, and l is the slant height of the cone. The first term, œÄr¬≤, is the area of the base, and the second term, œÄrl, is the lateral surface area.Now, the problem says that the lateral surface unfolds into a semicircle. When you unfold the lateral surface of a cone, you get a sector of a circle. In this case, it's a semicircle, which means it's half of a full circle. So, the lateral surface area is equal to the area of a semicircle.Let me think about that. The area of a full circle is œÄL¬≤, where L is the radius of that circle. Since it's a semicircle, the area would be (1/2)œÄL¬≤. But wait, when you unfold the lateral surface, the radius of the sector (which is the semicircle here) is actually the slant height (l) of the cone. So, the area of the lateral surface is (1/2)œÄl¬≤.But hold on, I also know that the lateral surface area can be expressed as œÄrl. So, setting these two expressions equal to each other:œÄrl = (1/2)œÄl¬≤Hmm, let's see. If I divide both sides by œÄl (assuming l ‚â† 0), I get:r = (1/2)lSo, that tells me that the radius of the base of the cone is half the slant height. That's a useful relationship.Now, the total surface area is given as 3œÄ. So, plugging into the surface area formula:SA = œÄr¬≤ + œÄrl = 3œÄBut from earlier, I found that r = (1/2)l. So, I can substitute r with (1/2)l in the equation:œÄ((1/2)l)¬≤ + œÄ((1/2)l)l = 3œÄLet me compute each term step by step. First, the base area:œÄ((1/2)l)¬≤ = œÄ*(1/4)l¬≤ = (œÄ/4)l¬≤Then, the lateral surface area:œÄ((1/2)l)l = œÄ*(1/2)l¬≤ = (œÄ/2)l¬≤Adding these together:(œÄ/4)l¬≤ + (œÄ/2)l¬≤ = 3œÄLet me combine the terms on the left. To add (œÄ/4)l¬≤ and (œÄ/2)l¬≤, I need a common denominator, which is 4:(œÄ/4)l¬≤ + (2œÄ/4)l¬≤ = (3œÄ/4)l¬≤So, (3œÄ/4)l¬≤ = 3œÄNow, I can divide both sides by œÄ to simplify:(3/4)l¬≤ = 3Then, multiply both sides by (4/3):l¬≤ = 3*(4/3) = 4So, l¬≤ = 4, which means l = 2 (since slant height can't be negative).Now that I have l = 2, and from earlier, r = (1/2)l, so:r = (1/2)*2 = 1So, the radius of the base is 1. Therefore, the diameter, which is twice the radius, is:d = 2r = 2*1 = 2Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the beginning: the lateral surface area is a semicircle, so its area is (1/2)œÄl¬≤. The total surface area is base area plus lateral surface area, which is œÄr¬≤ + (1/2)œÄl¬≤ = 3œÄ. Also, from the relationship when unfolding, the circumference of the base equals the length of the arc of the semicircle.The circumference of the base is 2œÄr, and the length of the arc of the semicircle is œÄl (since it's half the circumference of a full circle with radius l). So:2œÄr = œÄlDivide both sides by œÄ:2r = lWhich confirms the earlier relationship that l = 2r.So, substituting l = 2r into the surface area equation:œÄr¬≤ + (1/2)œÄ(2r)¬≤ = 3œÄCompute (2r)¬≤:(2r)¬≤ = 4r¬≤So, the lateral surface area becomes:(1/2)œÄ*4r¬≤ = 2œÄr¬≤Therefore, total surface area:œÄr¬≤ + 2œÄr¬≤ = 3œÄr¬≤ = 3œÄDivide both sides by œÄ:3r¬≤ = 3So, r¬≤ = 1, which means r = 1.Therefore, diameter d = 2r = 2.Wait, so both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. So, the diameter is 2.But hold on, in my initial calculation, I got l = 2, which led to r = 1, so diameter 2. But in the second method, I also got r = 1, so diameter 2. So, both ways, it's 2.But let me think again. The problem says the lateral surface unfolds into a semicircle. So, when you unfold it, the radius of the semicircle is the slant height, l. The length of the arc of the semicircle is œÄl, which should equal the circumference of the base, which is 2œÄr. So, œÄl = 2œÄr, leading to l = 2r.So, that's consistent.Then, the area of the lateral surface is (1/2)œÄl¬≤, which is equal to œÄrl.So, (1/2)œÄl¬≤ = œÄrlDivide both sides by œÄ:(1/2)l¬≤ = rlDivide both sides by l (assuming l ‚â† 0):(1/2)l = rWhich is the same as l = 2r.So, everything checks out.Then, plugging into the surface area:œÄr¬≤ + œÄrl = 3œÄBut since l = 2r, plug that in:œÄr¬≤ + œÄr*(2r) = œÄr¬≤ + 2œÄr¬≤ = 3œÄr¬≤ = 3œÄSo, 3œÄr¬≤ = 3œÄDivide both sides by œÄ:3r¬≤ = 3So, r¬≤ = 1, r = 1.Therefore, diameter is 2.So, yeah, I think that's solid. The diameter is 2.But wait, in the initial problem, it's given that the surface area is 3œÄ, and through calculations, I found that r = 1, so diameter is 2. That seems correct.But just to make sure, let me plug back in:If r = 1, then l = 2r = 2.So, lateral surface area is œÄrl = œÄ*1*2 = 2œÄ.Base area is œÄr¬≤ = œÄ*1¬≤ = œÄ.Total surface area is 2œÄ + œÄ = 3œÄ, which matches the given.Also, when you unfold the lateral surface, it's a semicircle with radius l = 2, so the area is (1/2)œÄ*(2)¬≤ = (1/2)œÄ*4 = 2œÄ, which again matches the lateral surface area.And the arc length of the semicircle is œÄ*l = œÄ*2 = 2œÄ, which is equal to the circumference of the base, 2œÄr = 2œÄ*1 = 2œÄ.Everything lines up perfectly. So, I'm confident that the diameter is 2.**Final Answer**The diameter of the base of the cone is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Let a and b be angles such that[cos (a + b) = cos a - cos b.]Find the maximum value of cos a.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Let ( a ) and ( b ) be angles such that[cos(a + b) = cos a - cos b.]I need to find the maximum value of ( cos a ).Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities. I know that ( cos(a + b) ) can be expanded using the cosine addition formula. That formula is:[cos(a + b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b.]So, substituting this into the given equation, I get:[cos a cos b - sin a sin b = cos a - cos b.]Alright, now I need to rearrange this equation to find a relationship between ( a ) and ( b ) that can help me find the maximum value of ( cos a ).Let me bring all the terms to one side to see if I can factor something out. Subtracting ( cos a ) and adding ( cos b ) to both sides gives:[cos a cos b - sin a sin b - cos a + cos b = 0.]Hmm, let me factor ( cos a ) out of the first and third terms:[cos a (cos b - 1) - sin a sin b + cos b = 0.]Wait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Let me try grouping differently. Let's see:Starting from:[cos a cos b - sin a sin b = cos a - cos b.]Let me subtract ( cos a ) from both sides:[cos a cos b - sin a sin b - cos a = -cos b.]Then, factor ( cos a ) from the first and third terms:[cos a (cos b - 1) - sin a sin b = -cos b.]Hmm, okay, so:[cos a (cos b - 1) - sin a sin b = -cos b.]Maybe I can move the ( -cos b ) to the left side:[cos a (cos b - 1) - sin a sin b + cos b = 0.]Alternatively, perhaps I can isolate ( cos a ). Let me try that.Starting again from:[cos a cos b - sin a sin b = cos a - cos b.]Let me bring all terms involving ( cos a ) to the left and others to the right:[cos a cos b - cos a = sin a sin b - cos b.]Factor ( cos a ) on the left:[cos a (cos b - 1) = sin a sin b - cos b.]Hmm, okay, so:[cos a = frac{sin a sin b - cos b}{cos b - 1}.]Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out a negative sign in the denominator to make it look nicer:[cos a = frac{sin a sin b - cos b}{-(1 - cos b)} = frac{cos b - sin a sin b}{1 - cos b}.]So, now I have:[cos a = frac{cos b - sin a sin b}{1 - cos b}.]Hmm, that's an expression for ( cos a ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ). I need to find the maximum value of ( cos a ), so maybe I can express this in terms of a single variable or find some relationship between ( a ) and ( b ) that allows me to maximize ( cos a ).Alternatively, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the sine terms. Let me try that.Starting from:[cos a = frac{cos b - sin a sin b}{1 - cos b}.]Square both sides:[cos^2 a = frac{(cos b - sin a sin b)^2}{(1 - cos b)^2}.]Expanding the numerator:[(cos b - sin a sin b)^2 = cos^2 b - 2 cos b sin a sin b + sin^2 a sin^2 b.]So, substituting back:[cos^2 a = frac{cos^2 b - 2 cos b sin a sin b + sin^2 a sin^2 b}{(1 - cos b)^2}.]Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.Let me think about another strategy. Perhaps using the identity ( cos(a + b) = cos a - cos b ), I can express ( cos(a + b) + cos b = cos a ). So:[cos a = cos(a + b) + cos b.]Hmm, that might be useful. Let me write that down:[cos a = cos(a + b) + cos b.]Now, I can use the identity for ( cos(a + b) ) again, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can use the sum-to-product formula on ( cos(a + b) + cos b ).Recall that:[cos C + cos D = 2 cosleft( frac{C + D}{2} right) cosleft( frac{C - D}{2} right).]So, applying this to ( cos(a + b) + cos b ), we have:[cos(a + b) + cos b = 2 cosleft( frac{(a + b) + b}{2} right) cosleft( frac{(a + b) - b}{2} right).]Simplifying the arguments:[= 2 cosleft( frac{a + 2b}{2} right) cosleft( frac{a}{2} right).]So:[cos a = 2 cosleft( frac{a}{2} + b right) cosleft( frac{a}{2} right).]Hmm, interesting. Let me write this as:[cos a = 2 cosleft( frac{a}{2} right) cosleft( frac{a}{2} + b right).]Now, perhaps I can let ( theta = frac{a}{2} ). Then, ( a = 2theta ), and the equation becomes:[cos(2theta) = 2 cos theta cos(theta + b).]I know that ( cos(2theta) = 2 cos^2 theta - 1 ), so substituting that in:[2 cos^2 theta - 1 = 2 cos theta cos(theta + b).]Let me rearrange this:[2 cos^2 theta - 2 cos theta cos(theta + b) - 1 = 0.]Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of ( cos theta ). Let me denote ( x = cos theta ). Then, the equation becomes:[2x^2 - 2x cos(theta + b) - 1 = 0.]Wait, but ( cos(theta + b) ) is still in terms of ( theta ) and ( b ). Maybe I can express ( cos(theta + b) ) in terms of ( x ) and some other variable.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider ( cos(theta + b) ) as another variable. Let me denote ( y = cos(theta + b) ). Then, the equation becomes:[2x^2 - 2xy - 1 = 0.]But I also know that ( y = cos(theta + b) ). Maybe I can find a relationship between ( x ) and ( y ).Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for ( cos(theta + b) ):[cos(theta + b) = cos theta cos b - sin theta sin b.]So, substituting back into the equation:[2x^2 - 2x(cos theta cos b - sin theta sin b) - 1 = 0.]But ( x = cos theta ), so:[2x^2 - 2x(x cos b - sqrt{1 - x^2} sin b) - 1 = 0.]Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me write it out:[2x^2 - 2x^2 cos b + 2x sqrt{1 - x^2} sin b - 1 = 0.]Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe there's another approach.Let me go back to the original equation:[cos(a + b) = cos a - cos b.]I wonder if I can find a relationship between ( a ) and ( b ) that allows me to express one in terms of the other.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider this as an equation in ( b ) for a given ( a ), and then find conditions on ( a ) such that the equation has a solution.Let me rearrange the original equation:[cos(a + b) + cos b = cos a.]Using the sum-to-product identity again on the left side:[2 cosleft( frac{a + 2b}{2} right) cosleft( frac{a}{2} right) = cos a.]So:[2 cosleft( frac{a}{2} + b right) cosleft( frac{a}{2} right) = cos a.]Hmm, this seems similar to what I had before. Let me denote ( phi = frac{a}{2} ), so ( a = 2phi ), and the equation becomes:[2 cos(phi + b) cos phi = cos(2phi).]We know that ( cos(2phi) = 2 cos^2 phi - 1 ), so substituting:[2 cos(phi + b) cos phi = 2 cos^2 phi - 1.]Divide both sides by 2:[cos(phi + b) cos phi = cos^2 phi - frac{1}{2}.]Hmm, maybe I can solve for ( cos(phi + b) ):[cos(phi + b) = frac{cos^2 phi - frac{1}{2}}{cos phi} = cos phi - frac{1}{2 cos phi}.]So:[cos(phi + b) = cos phi - frac{1}{2 cos phi}.]Now, since ( cos(phi + b) ) must lie between -1 and 1, the right-hand side must also lie within this interval. Therefore:[-1 leq cos phi - frac{1}{2 cos phi} leq 1.]Let me denote ( x = cos phi ). Then, the inequality becomes:[-1 leq x - frac{1}{2x} leq 1.]So, I have:[x - frac{1}{2x} geq -1 quad text{and} quad x - frac{1}{2x} leq 1.]Let me solve these inequalities separately.First inequality:[x - frac{1}{2x} geq -1.]Multiply both sides by ( 2x ), but I have to be careful about the sign of ( x ). Since ( x = cos phi ), ( x ) can be between -1 and 1. However, if ( x ) is negative, multiplying both sides by ( 2x ) will reverse the inequality.Let me consider two cases:Case 1: ( x > 0 ).Then, multiplying both sides by ( 2x ):[2x^2 - 1 geq -2x.]Bring all terms to one side:[2x^2 + 2x - 1 geq 0.]This is a quadratic in ( x ). Let me find its roots:[2x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0.]Using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 8}}{4} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{12}}{4} = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{3}}{2}.]So, the roots are ( x = frac{-1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ) and ( x = frac{-1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ). Since ( x > 0 ), only ( x = frac{-1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ) is relevant.The quadratic ( 2x^2 + 2x - 1 ) opens upwards, so it is greater than or equal to zero when ( x leq frac{-1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ) or ( x geq frac{-1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ). But since ( x > 0 ), the relevant interval is ( x geq frac{-1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ).Case 2: ( x < 0 ).Multiplying both sides by ( 2x ) (negative), so inequality reverses:[2x^2 - 1 leq -2x.]Bring all terms to one side:[2x^2 + 2x - 1 leq 0.]Again, the quadratic ( 2x^2 + 2x - 1 ) has roots at ( x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{3}}{2} ). Since ( x < 0 ), we are interested in ( x leq frac{-1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ) or ( x geq frac{-1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ). But since ( x < 0 ), the relevant interval is ( x leq frac{-1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ).However, ( x = cos phi ) must be between -1 and 1. Let me check the value of ( frac{-1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ):[frac{-1 - sqrt{3}}{2} approx frac{-1 - 1.732}{2} = frac{-2.732}{2} approx -1.366,]which is less than -1, so the only valid solution in this case is when ( x leq -1 ), but ( x geq -1 ) because it's a cosine function. So, the only possible value here is ( x = -1 ).But let's check if ( x = -1 ) satisfies the original inequality:[-1 - frac{1}{2(-1)} = -1 + frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{2} geq -1,]which is true. So, for ( x < 0 ), the inequality holds only when ( x = -1 ).Now, let's move to the second inequality:[x - frac{1}{2x} leq 1.]Again, considering ( x > 0 ) and ( x < 0 ).Case 1: ( x > 0 ).Multiply both sides by ( 2x ):[2x^2 - 1 leq 2x.]Bring all terms to one side:[2x^2 - 2x - 1 leq 0.]Quadratic equation:[2x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0.]Solutions:[x = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 8}}{4} = frac{2 pm sqrt{12}}{4} = frac{2 pm 2sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{1 pm sqrt{3}}{2}.]So, roots are ( x = frac{1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ) and ( x = frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ). Since ( x > 0 ), we consider ( x leq frac{1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ) and ( x geq frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ). But ( frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ) is negative, so for ( x > 0 ), the inequality holds when ( 0 < x leq frac{1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ).Case 2: ( x < 0 ).Multiply both sides by ( 2x ), which is negative, so inequality reverses:[2x^2 - 1 geq 2x.]Bring all terms to one side:[2x^2 - 2x - 1 geq 0.]Quadratic equation:[2x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0.]Solutions are the same as before: ( x = frac{1 pm sqrt{3}}{2} ). Since ( x < 0 ), the relevant interval is ( x leq frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ) or ( x geq frac{1 + sqrt{3}}{2} ). But ( x < 0 ), so the relevant interval is ( x leq frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ).Again, ( frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} approx frac{1 - 1.732}{2} = frac{-0.732}{2} approx -0.366 ). So, for ( x < 0 ), the inequality holds when ( x leq -0.366 ).Now, combining the results from both inequalities:For ( x > 0 ):- From the first inequality: ( x geq frac{-1 + sqrt{3}}{2} approx 0.366 ).- From the second inequality: ( x leq frac{1 + sqrt{3}}{2} approx 1.366 ). But since ( x leq 1 ), the upper bound is 1.So, for ( x > 0 ), the valid interval is ( frac{-1 + sqrt{3}}{2} leq x leq 1 ).For ( x < 0 ):- From the first inequality: ( x = -1 ).- From the second inequality: ( x leq frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} approx -0.366 ).But ( x = cos phi ) must be between -1 and 1. So, for ( x < 0 ), the valid interval is ( -1 leq x leq frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} ).However, we need to remember that ( x = cos phi ), and ( phi = frac{a}{2} ). So, ( x ) is between -1 and 1, but we are looking for the maximum value of ( cos a ). Since ( a = 2phi ), ( cos a = cos(2phi) = 2x^2 - 1 ).So, to maximize ( cos a ), we need to maximize ( 2x^2 - 1 ). Since ( 2x^2 - 1 ) is an increasing function of ( x^2 ), the maximum occurs when ( |x| ) is maximized.Looking at the intervals for ( x ):For ( x > 0 ): ( x ) can go up to 1. So, the maximum ( x ) is 1, which would give ( cos a = 2(1)^2 - 1 = 1 ).For ( x < 0 ): The maximum ( |x| ) is 1 (at ( x = -1 )), which would give ( cos a = 2(-1)^2 - 1 = 1 ).So, in both cases, the maximum value of ( cos a ) is 1.But wait, I need to check if ( x = 1 ) is achievable. If ( x = 1 ), then ( cos phi = 1 ), so ( phi = 0 ), which means ( a = 0 ). Let's check if this satisfies the original equation.If ( a = 0 ), then the original equation becomes:[cos(0 + b) = cos 0 - cos b implies cos b = 1 - cos b.]So, ( 2 cos b = 1 implies cos b = frac{1}{2} implies b = pm frac{pi}{3} + 2pi k ), where ( k ) is an integer.So, yes, ( a = 0 ) and ( b = frac{pi}{3} ) satisfy the equation, and ( cos a = 1 ).Similarly, if ( x = -1 ), then ( cos phi = -1 implies phi = pi implies a = 2pi ). Let's check this:( a = 2pi ), so ( cos(a + b) = cos(2pi + b) = cos b ).The original equation becomes:[cos b = cos(2pi) - cos b implies cos b = 1 - cos b implies 2 cos b = 1 implies cos b = frac{1}{2}.]So, ( b = pm frac{pi}{3} + 2pi k ). Again, this works, and ( cos a = cos(2pi) = 1 ).Therefore, the maximum value of ( cos a ) is indeed 1.I think this makes sense. The maximum value of cosine is 1, and we've found angles ( a ) and ( b ) that satisfy the given equation with ( cos a = 1 ). So, I don't think we can get a higher value than 1 for ( cos a ).**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( cos a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"If int_{0}^{k} (x-2x^{2})dx=0 (k > 0), then k equals („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: frac{1}{2}B: frac{3}{4}C: 1D: frac{3}{2}","answer":"Okay, so I have this integral problem here: the integral from 0 to k of (x minus 2x squared) dx equals zero, and I need to find the value of k where k is greater than zero. The options are A: 1/2, B: 3/4, C: 1, and D: 3/2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that to solve a definite integral, I need to find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the upper and lower limits. So, let me start by finding the antiderivative of (x - 2x¬≤).The antiderivative of x is (1/2)x¬≤, right? Because when you take the derivative of (1/2)x¬≤, you get x. Then, the antiderivative of -2x¬≤ would be -2 times the antiderivative of x¬≤. The antiderivative of x¬≤ is (1/3)x¬≥, so multiplying that by -2 gives me -(2/3)x¬≥. So putting it all together, the antiderivative of (x - 2x¬≤) is (1/2)x¬≤ - (2/3)x¬≥.Now, I need to evaluate this from 0 to k. That means I substitute k into the antiderivative and subtract the value of the antiderivative at 0. Let me write that out:[(1/2)k¬≤ - (2/3)k¬≥] - [(1/2)(0)¬≤ - (2/3)(0)¬≥]Simplifying the second part, since anything multiplied by zero is zero, that whole expression becomes 0. So, the integral simplifies to (1/2)k¬≤ - (2/3)k¬≥.According to the problem, this integral equals zero. So, I can set up the equation:(1/2)k¬≤ - (2/3)k¬≥ = 0Now, I need to solve for k. Let me factor out the common terms. I notice that both terms have a k¬≤, so I can factor that out:k¬≤[(1/2) - (2/3)k] = 0So, this gives me two possibilities. Either k¬≤ = 0 or the expression in the brackets equals zero. But since k is greater than zero, k¬≤ can't be zero because that would mean k = 0, which isn't allowed here. So, I can ignore the k¬≤ = 0 solution.That leaves me with the equation inside the brackets:(1/2) - (2/3)k = 0Now, I need to solve for k. Let me rewrite this equation:(1/2) = (2/3)kTo solve for k, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2). So, multiplying both sides by (3/2):(1/2) * (3/2) = kCalculating that, (1/2)*(3/2) is 3/4. So, k equals 3/4.Let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the integral, I found the antiderivative correctly: (1/2)x¬≤ - (2/3)x¬≥. Evaluated from 0 to k, that gives (1/2)k¬≤ - (2/3)k¬≥. Setting that equal to zero, factoring out k¬≤, and solving for k gives me 3/4. That seems right.Looking back at the options, 3/4 is option B. So, I think the correct answer is B.Just to be thorough, let me plug k = 3/4 back into the integral to verify.First, compute (1/2)(3/4)¬≤ - (2/3)(3/4)¬≥.Calculating (3/4)¬≤ is 9/16, so (1/2)(9/16) is 9/32.Then, (3/4)¬≥ is 27/64, so (2/3)(27/64) is (54/192), which simplifies to 9/32.So, subtracting these: 9/32 - 9/32 equals 0. That checks out. So, yes, k = 3/4 is indeed the correct solution.I think I've covered all the steps and verified my answer. It makes sense, and I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is B: 3/4.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Given that the angle between vectors a and b is 120^{circ}, a=(1,sqrt{3}), and |b|=1, find |a+b|=________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the magnitude of the sum of two vectors, a and b. The angle between them is 120 degrees, vector a is given as (1, sqrt(3)), and the magnitude of vector b is 1. Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that to find the magnitude of the sum of two vectors, I can use the formula involving the dot product. The formula is |a + b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2|a||b|cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between them. Hmm, that seems right. Let me make sure I recall it correctly. Yeah, I think that's the law of cosines applied to vectors.So, I need to find |a|, which is the magnitude of vector a. Vector a is (1, sqrt(3)). The magnitude of a vector (x, y) is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Let me compute that. So, |a| = sqrt(1^2 + (sqrt(3))^2). Calculating that, 1 squared is 1, and (sqrt(3)) squared is 3. So, 1 + 3 is 4, and the square root of 4 is 2. Okay, so |a| is 2.Next, I need |b|, which is given as 1. So, that's straightforward.Now, the angle between them is 120 degrees. I need to find the cosine of 120 degrees. I remember that 120 degrees is in the second quadrant, so cosine will be negative. Also, 120 degrees is equal to 180 - 60 degrees. The cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5, so the cosine of 120 degrees should be -0.5. Let me confirm that. Yes, cos(120¬∞) = cos(180¬∞ - 60¬∞) = -cos(60¬∞) = -0.5. Got it.Now, plugging everything into the formula: |a + b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2|a||b|cos(theta)). Let me substitute the values I have. |a| is 2, so |a|^2 is 4. |b| is 1, so |b|^2 is 1. Then, 2|a||b|cos(theta) is 2 * 2 * 1 * (-0.5). Let me compute that: 2 * 2 is 4, 4 * 1 is 4, and 4 * (-0.5) is -2. So, putting it all together, inside the square root, I have 4 + 1 + (-2). That simplifies to 4 + 1 is 5, minus 2 is 3. So, |a + b| is sqrt(3).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, |a| is definitely 2 because sqrt(1 + 3) is 2. |b| is given as 1, so that's correct. The angle is 120 degrees, and cos(120¬∞) is indeed -0.5. Plugging into the formula: 4 + 1 + (-2) is 3, and the square root of 3 is approximately 1.732. That seems reasonable.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by using the component form of vector b and then adding it to vector a? Let me try that to verify.Vector a is (1, sqrt(3)). Vector b has a magnitude of 1 and makes a 120-degree angle with vector a. To find the components of vector b, I can represent it in terms of its x and y components. If I consider vector a along the positive x-axis, then vector b would make a 120-degree angle with the x-axis. Wait, no, actually, the angle between a and b is 120 degrees, but vector a isn't necessarily along the x-axis. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust for that.Alternatively, since vector a is given as (1, sqrt(3)), I can find its direction. The direction of vector a can be found using the arctangent of (sqrt(3)/1), which is 60 degrees from the x-axis. So, vector a is at 60 degrees. Therefore, vector b, which is at 120 degrees relative to vector a, would be at 60 + 120 = 180 degrees from the x-axis? Wait, no, that might not be correct. The angle between them is 120 degrees, so if vector a is at 60 degrees, vector b could be at 60 + 120 = 180 degrees or 60 - 120 = -60 degrees. Hmm, I need to clarify.Actually, the angle between two vectors is the smallest angle between them, so it's 120 degrees. If vector a is at 60 degrees, vector b could be either 60 + 120 = 180 degrees or 60 - 120 = -60 degrees from the x-axis. Let me consider both possibilities.First, if vector b is at 180 degrees from the x-axis, its components would be (cos(180¬∞), sin(180¬∞)) = (-1, 0). Then, adding vector a (1, sqrt(3)) to vector b (-1, 0) would give (1 + (-1), sqrt(3) + 0) = (0, sqrt(3)). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(0^2 + (sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(3), which matches my earlier result.Alternatively, if vector b is at -60 degrees from the x-axis, its components would be (cos(-60¬∞), sin(-60¬∞)) = (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). Adding this to vector a (1, sqrt(3)) would give (1 + 0.5, sqrt(3) + (-sqrt(3)/2)) = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt((1.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2). Calculating that: (1.5)^2 is 2.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4 or 0.75. Adding them gives 2.25 + 0.75 = 3, so the magnitude is sqrt(3) as well.Wait, so regardless of the direction of vector b relative to vector a, the magnitude of a + b is sqrt(3). That's interesting. So, both possibilities give the same result. That makes sense because the angle between them is fixed, so the resultant magnitude should be the same regardless of the specific orientation, as long as the angle between them is 120 degrees.Therefore, both methods confirm that |a + b| is sqrt(3). I think I've got it right. The key was using the formula for the magnitude of the sum of two vectors, which involves their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. Alternatively, breaking down vector b into components and adding them to vector a also led to the same result, which is reassuring.I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both approaches gave me the same answer. So, I'm confident that the magnitude of a + b is sqrt(3)."},{"question":"In the polar coordinate system and the Cartesian coordinate system xOy with the same unit of length, taking the origin as the pole and the positive half-axis of x as the polar axis, the polar equation of curve C_{1} is rho=4sin theta, and the parametric equation of curve C_{2} is begin{cases}x=m+tcos a  y=tsin aend{cases} (t is the parameter, 0leqslant alpha < pi).

Let me try to tackle them step by step. First, I need to understand what each part is asking and figure out how to approach them.Starting with part (1): I need to prove that |OB| + |OC| equals ‚àö2 times |OA|. All these points A, B, and C are intersections of certain rays with the curve C‚ÇÅ, whose polar equation is œÅ = 4 sin Œ∏. The rays are Œ∏ = œÜ, Œ∏ = œÜ + œÄ/4, and Œ∏ = œÜ - œÄ/4. So, points A, B, and C are where these rays intersect C‚ÇÅ, excluding the origin O.Okay, so since these are polar coordinates, the distance from the origin to each point is just the value of œÅ at that angle. So, for point A, which is on Œ∏ = œÜ, the distance OA is 4 sin œÜ. Similarly, OB is 4 sin(œÜ + œÄ/4) and OC is 4 sin(œÜ - œÄ/4). So, I need to compute OB + OC and show that it's equal to ‚àö2 times OA.Let me write that down:|OA| = 4 sin œÜ|OB| = 4 sin(œÜ + œÄ/4)|OC| = 4 sin(œÜ - œÄ/4)So, |OB| + |OC| = 4 sin(œÜ + œÄ/4) + 4 sin(œÜ - œÄ/4)Hmm, I remember there's a trigonometric identity for sin(A + B) + sin(A - B). Let me recall:sin(A + B) + sin(A - B) = 2 sin A cos BYes, that's right. So, applying this identity:sin(œÜ + œÄ/4) + sin(œÜ - œÄ/4) = 2 sin œÜ cos(œÄ/4)Since cos(œÄ/4) is ‚àö2/2, this becomes:2 sin œÜ * (‚àö2/2) = ‚àö2 sin œÜTherefore, |OB| + |OC| = 4 * ‚àö2 sin œÜ = ‚àö2 * (4 sin œÜ) = ‚àö2 |OA|So, that proves part (1). That wasn't too bad once I remembered the trigonometric identity.Now, moving on to part (2). When œÜ = 5œÄ/12, points B and C lie on curve C‚ÇÇ. Curve C‚ÇÇ has parametric equations:x = m + t cos Œ±y = t sin Œ±where t is the parameter, and Œ± is between 0 and œÄ. I need to find the values of m and Œ±.First, let me figure out the coordinates of points B and C when œÜ = 5œÄ/12.Given that œÜ = 5œÄ/12, the angles for points B and C are:For B: Œ∏ = œÜ + œÄ/4 = 5œÄ/12 + œÄ/4Let me compute that. œÄ/4 is 3œÄ/12, so 5œÄ/12 + 3œÄ/12 = 8œÄ/12 = 2œÄ/3.Similarly, for C: Œ∏ = œÜ - œÄ/4 = 5œÄ/12 - œÄ/4 = 5œÄ/12 - 3œÄ/12 = 2œÄ/12 = œÄ/6.So, points B and C are at angles 2œÄ/3 and œÄ/6, respectively.Now, using the polar equation œÅ = 4 sin Œ∏, let's compute their distances from the origin.For point B: œÅ = 4 sin(2œÄ/3). Sin(2œÄ/3) is sin(œÄ - œÄ/3) = sin(œÄ/3) = ‚àö3/2. So, œÅ = 4*(‚àö3/2) = 2‚àö3.For point C: œÅ = 4 sin(œÄ/6). Sin(œÄ/6) is 1/2, so œÅ = 4*(1/2) = 2.So, the polar coordinates are:B: (2‚àö3, 2œÄ/3)C: (2, œÄ/6)Now, I need to convert these polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates to find their (x, y) positions.For point B:x = œÅ cos Œ∏ = 2‚àö3 cos(2œÄ/3)y = œÅ sin Œ∏ = 2‚àö3 sin(2œÄ/3)Compute cos(2œÄ/3): that's cos(œÄ - œÄ/3) = -cos(œÄ/3) = -1/2Compute sin(2œÄ/3): that's sin(œÄ - œÄ/3) = sin(œÄ/3) = ‚àö3/2So, x = 2‚àö3*(-1/2) = -‚àö3y = 2‚àö3*(‚àö3/2) = (2‚àö3*‚àö3)/2 = (6)/2 = 3Therefore, point B is (-‚àö3, 3)For point C:x = œÅ cos Œ∏ = 2 cos(œÄ/6)y = œÅ sin Œ∏ = 2 sin(œÄ/6)Compute cos(œÄ/6) = ‚àö3/2Compute sin(œÄ/6) = 1/2So, x = 2*(‚àö3/2) = ‚àö3y = 2*(1/2) = 1Therefore, point C is (‚àö3, 1)So now, points B(-‚àö3, 3) and C(‚àö3, 1) lie on curve C‚ÇÇ, which is given by the parametric equations:x = m + t cos Œ±y = t sin Œ±I need to find m and Œ± such that both points B and C satisfy these equations for some parameters t.Let me denote the parameters for points B and C as t‚ÇÅ and t‚ÇÇ respectively.So, for point B:-‚àö3 = m + t‚ÇÅ cos Œ±3 = t‚ÇÅ sin Œ±For point C:‚àö3 = m + t‚ÇÇ cos Œ±1 = t‚ÇÇ sin Œ±So, I have two systems of equations:1) -‚àö3 = m + t‚ÇÅ cos Œ±   3 = t‚ÇÅ sin Œ±2) ‚àö3 = m + t‚ÇÇ cos Œ±   1 = t‚ÇÇ sin Œ±I can solve these equations for m and Œ±.Let me first solve for t‚ÇÅ and t‚ÇÇ from the second equations.From equation 1:t‚ÇÅ sin Œ± = 3 => t‚ÇÅ = 3 / sin Œ±From equation 2:t‚ÇÇ sin Œ± = 1 => t‚ÇÇ = 1 / sin Œ±Now, substitute t‚ÇÅ and t‚ÇÇ into the first equations.From equation 1:-‚àö3 = m + (3 / sin Œ±) cos Œ±From equation 2:‚àö3 = m + (1 / sin Œ±) cos Œ±Let me denote cos Œ± / sin Œ± as cot Œ±. So, we can write:Equation 1: -‚àö3 = m + 3 cot Œ±Equation 2: ‚àö3 = m + cot Œ±Now, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:(-‚àö3) - (‚àö3) = (m + 3 cot Œ±) - (m + cot Œ±)-2‚àö3 = 2 cot Œ±Therefore, cot Œ± = -‚àö3Which implies tan Œ± = -1/‚àö3Since Œ± is between 0 and œÄ, tan Œ± = -1/‚àö3 implies that Œ± is in the second quadrant. The reference angle for tan Œ± = 1/‚àö3 is œÄ/6, so Œ± = œÄ - œÄ/6 = 5œÄ/6.So, Œ± = 5œÄ/6.Now, let's find m.From equation 2: ‚àö3 = m + cot Œ±We know cot Œ± = -‚àö3, so:‚àö3 = m - ‚àö3Therefore, m = ‚àö3 + ‚àö3 = 2‚àö3So, m = 2‚àö3 and Œ± = 5œÄ/6.Let me verify this with point B.From point B:x = m + t cos Œ± = 2‚àö3 + t cos(5œÄ/6)cos(5œÄ/6) = -‚àö3/2So, x = 2‚àö3 + t*(-‚àö3/2) = 2‚àö3 - (t‚àö3)/2Similarly, y = t sin(5œÄ/6) = t*(1/2)From point B, y = 3, so t*(1/2) = 3 => t = 6Then, x = 2‚àö3 - (6‚àö3)/2 = 2‚àö3 - 3‚àö3 = -‚àö3, which matches.Similarly, for point C:x = 2‚àö3 + t cos(5œÄ/6) = 2‚àö3 + t*(-‚àö3/2)y = t sin(5œÄ/6) = t*(1/2) = 1 => t = 2Then, x = 2‚àö3 - (2‚àö3)/2 = 2‚àö3 - ‚àö3 = ‚àö3, which also matches.So, everything checks out.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{|OB| + |OC| = sqrt{2}|OA|}(2) boxed{m = 2sqrt{3}}, boxed{alpha = dfrac{5pi}{6}}"},{"question":"Mandy researched 42 med schools.

I need to figure out how many such pairs of polygons exist. The answer choices are from A to E, with E being infinitely many.

So, if I have two polygons, let's say one has ( r ) sides and the other has ( k ) sides, their interior angles would be:[text{Interior angle of first polygon} = frac{(r - 2) times 180^circ}{r}][text{Interior angle of second polygon} = frac{(k - 2) times 180^circ}{k}]According to the problem, the ratio of these two angles is 4:3.

Maybe factor by grouping:First, factor out a negative sign from the first term:[- rk - 6k + 8r = 0]Let me rearrange the terms:[- rk + 8r - 6k = 0]Factor out an ( r ) from the first two terms:[r(-k + 8) - 6k = 0]Hmm, that gives me:[r(8 - k) - 6k = 0]Let me bring the ( -6k ) to the other side:[r(8 - k) = 6k]Now, solve for ( r ):[r = frac{6k}{8 - k}]Okay, so ( r ) must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 because a polygon must have at least 3 sides. Similarly, ( k ) must also be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.So, let's consider the equation ( r = frac{6k}{8 - k} ). Since both ( r ) and ( k ) are integers, ( 8 - k ) must divide evenly into ( 6k ). Let's denote ( d = 8 - k ), so ( d ) must be a positive integer because ( k < 8 ) (since ( 8 - k ) is in the denominator and must be positive to keep ( r ) positive). Therefore, ( k ) can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.Let's test each possible value of ( k ):1. **Case 1: ( k = 3 )**   [   r = frac{6 times 3}{8 - 3} = frac{18}{5} = 3.6   ]   Hmm, ( r ) is not an integer here. So, this case is invalid.2. **Case 2: ( k = 4 )**   [   r = frac{6 times 4}{8 - 4} = frac{24}{4} = 6   ]   Okay, ( r = 6 ) is an integer. So, this is a valid pair: ( k = 4 ) and ( r = 6 ).3. **Case 3: ( k = 5 )**   [   r = frac{6 times 5}{8 - 5} = frac{30}{3} = 10   ]   ( r = 10 ) is an integer. So, another valid pair: ( k = 5 ) and ( r = 10 ).4. **Case 4: ( k = 6 )**   [   r = frac{6 times 6}{8 - 6} = frac{36}{2} = 18   ]   ( r = 18 ) is an integer. So, another valid pair: ( k = 6 ) and ( r = 18 ).5. **Case 5: ( k = 7 )**   [   r = frac{6 times 7}{8 - 7} = frac{42}{1} = 42   ]   ( r = 42 ) is an integer. So, another valid pair: ( k = 7 ) and ( r = 42 ).Wait, so I have four possible values for ( k ): 4, 5, 6, and 7, each giving an integer value for ( r ). That would mean there are four pairs of polygons. But hold on, the answer choices only go up to D) 4, so maybe that's the answer? But let me double-check.Wait, hold on. The problem says \\"the ratio of their interior angles is 4:3\\". So, does that mean the first polygon's angle is 4 and the second is 3, or could it be the other way around? Because in my previous reasoning, I assumed that ( r ) corresponds to the 4 part and ( k ) to the 3 part. But maybe it could be the other way around as well.So, perhaps I should also consider the ratio ( frac{text{Interior angle of second polygon}}{text{Interior angle of first polygon}} = frac{4}{3} ). That would mean swapping ( r ) and ( k ). Let me see if that gives any additional solutions.So, if I set up the ratio as:[frac{frac{(k - 2) times 180^circ}{k}}{frac{(r - 2) times 180^circ}{r}} = frac{4}{3}]Which simplifies to:[frac{(k - 2)/k}{(r - 2)/r} = frac{4}{3}]Cross-multiplying:[3(k - 2)r = 4(r - 2)k]Expanding:[3kr - 6r = 4kr - 8k]Bringing all terms to one side:[3kr - 6r - 4kr + 8k = 0]Simplify:[- kr - 6r + 8k = 0]Factor:[- r(k + 6) + 8k = 0]Rearranged:[r(k + 6) = 8k]So,[r = frac{8k}{k + 6}]Again, ( r ) must be an integer greater than or equal to 3, and ( k ) must also be an integer greater than or equal to 3.Let's test possible values of ( k ):1. **Case 1: ( k = 3 )**   [   r = frac{8 times 3}{3 + 6} = frac{24}{9} = 2.overline{6}   ]   Not an integer. Invalid.2. **Case 2: ( k = 4 )**   [   r = frac{8 times 4}{4 + 6} = frac{32}{10} = 3.2   ]   Not an integer. Invalid.3. **Case 3: ( k = 5 )**   [   r = frac{8 times 5}{5 + 6} = frac{40}{11} approx 3.636   ]   Not an integer. Invalid.4. **Case 4: ( k = 6 )**   [   r = frac{8 times 6}{6 + 6} = frac{48}{12} = 4   ]   ( r = 4 ) is an integer. So, another valid pair: ( k = 6 ) and ( r = 4 ).5. **Case 5: ( k = 7 )**   [   r = frac{8 times 7}{7 + 6} = frac{56}{13} approx 4.307   ]   Not an integer. Invalid.6. **Case 6: ( k = 8 )**   [   r = frac{8 times 8}{8 + 6} = frac{64}{14} approx 4.571   ]   Not an integer. Invalid.7. **Case 7: ( k = 9 )**   [   r = frac{8 times 9}{9 + 6} = frac{72}{15} = 4.8   ]   Not an integer. Invalid.8. **Case 8: ( k = 10 )**   [   r = frac{8 times 10}{10 + 6} = frac{80}{16} = 5   ]   ( r = 5 ) is an integer. So, another valid pair: ( k = 10 ) and ( r = 5 ).Wait, so in this case, when I considered the ratio the other way around, I got two more valid pairs: ( (k, r) = (6, 4) ) and ( (10, 5) ). But hold on, these are essentially the same pairs as before, just swapped. For example, ( (6, 4) ) is the same as ( (4, 6) ) because the ratio can be either way. Similarly, ( (10, 5) ) is the same as ( (5, 10) ).So, does that mean I have four distinct pairs? Or are these considered the same pairs? The problem says \\"pairs of polygons\\", so I think the order doesn't matter. That is, a pair consisting of a hexagon and a square is the same as a pair consisting of a square and a hexagon. Therefore, these are not distinct pairs.Wait, but in my first approach, I found four pairs: ( (4, 6) ), ( (5, 10) ), ( (6, 18) ), and ( (7, 42) ). But when I considered the ratio the other way, I got ( (6, 4) ) and ( (10, 5) ), which are duplicates of the first two. So, in total, I have four unique pairs.But hold on, let me check if all these pairs satisfy the original ratio of 4:3.Take ( (4, 6) ):Interior angle of square (4 sides): ( frac{(4 - 2) times 180}{4} = 90^circ )Interior angle of hexagon (6 sides): ( frac{(6 - 2) times 180}{6} = 120^circ )Ratio: ( 120:90 = 4:3 ). Correct.Take ( (5, 10) ):Interior angle of pentagon (5 sides): ( frac{(5 - 2) times 180}{5} = 108^circ )Interior angle of decagon (10 sides): ( frac{(10 - 2) times 180}{10} = 144^circ )Ratio: ( 144:108 = 4:3 ). Correct.Take ( (6, 18) ):Interior angle of hexagon (6 sides): ( 120^circ )Interior angle of 18-gon: ( frac{(18 - 2) times 180}{18} = frac{16 times 180}{18} = 160^circ )Ratio: ( 160:120 = 4:3 ). Correct.Take ( (7, 42) ):Interior angle of heptagon (7 sides): ( frac{(7 - 2) times 180}{7} approx 128.57^circ )Interior angle of 42-gon: ( frac{(42 - 2) times 180}{42} = frac{40 times 180}{42} approx 171.43^circ )Ratio: ( 171.43:128.57 approx 4:3 ). Correct.So, all four pairs satisfy the ratio. Therefore, there are four such pairs of polygons.But wait, the answer choices only go up to D) 4, so I think that's the answer. But let me double-check if I missed any constraints.The problem states that both polygons have sides of unit length. Does that affect the number of sides? Well, regular polygons with unit sides can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3, so as long as ( r ) and ( k ) are integers greater than or equal to 3, it's fine. So, all four pairs are valid.Wait, but in my initial approach, I considered ( k ) from 3 to 7, but when I swapped the ratio, I had to go higher for ( k ) to get integer values for ( r ). But in the first case, I only got four pairs, and in the second case, the additional pairs were duplicates. So, in total, four unique pairs.But hold on, the problem says \\"pairs of polygons\\", so if I consider that a pair is unordered, meaning (r, k) is the same as (k, r), then actually, each pair is counted twice in my four pairs. For example, (4,6) and (6,4) are the same pair. Similarly, (5,10) and (10,5) are the same. So, actually, I have two unique pairs: one with 4 and 6 sides, and another with 5 and 10 sides, 6 and 18, and 7 and 42. Wait, no, because 6 and 18 are different from 4 and 6. So, actually, each of these four is a distinct pair because the number of sides are different.Wait, no, if we consider unordered pairs, then (4,6) is the same as (6,4), but since in my first approach, I already considered both directions, but in reality, each pair is unique based on the number of sides. So, (4,6), (5,10), (6,18), and (7,42) are four distinct pairs because each has a different combination of sides.Therefore, the answer should be 4, which is option D.But wait, hold on. Let me check if all these polygons with 4,5,6,7,10,18,42 sides are valid. Yes, regular polygons can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3, so all these are valid.But wait, in my first approach, when I set up the ratio as ( frac{r}{k} = frac{4}{3} ), I got four pairs, but when I considered the reverse ratio, I got two more, but they were duplicates. So, in total, four unique pairs.But the answer choices are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)infinite.So, according to my reasoning, the answer is D)4.But wait, the initial answer provided was B)2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.Wait, let me go back to the equation:From the first ratio:[frac{(r - 2)/r}{(k - 2)/k} = frac{4}{3}]Which simplifies to:[frac{(r - 2)k}{(k - 2)r} = frac{4}{3}]Cross-multiplying:[3(r - 2)k = 4(k - 2)r]Expanding:[3rk - 6k = 4kr - 8r]Bringing all terms to one side:[3rk - 6k - 4kr + 8r = 0]Simplify:[- rk - 6k + 8r = 0]Which can be written as:[rk + 6k - 8r = 0]Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign when moving terms. Let me check:From:[3rk - 6k = 4kr - 8r]Subtract ( 4kr ) and add ( 8r ) to both sides:[3rk - 6k - 4kr + 8r = 0]Which simplifies to:[- rk - 6k + 8r = 0]Factor:[- rk + 8r - 6k = 0]Factor out ( r ) from the first two terms:[r(-k + 8) - 6k = 0]Which is:[r(8 - k) = 6k]So,[r = frac{6k}{8 - k}]So, ( 8 - k ) must be a positive integer, so ( k < 8 ). So, ( k ) can be 3,4,5,6,7.Testing these:- ( k=3 ): ( r=18/5=3.6 ) invalid- ( k=4 ): ( r=24/4=6 ) valid- ( k=5 ): ( r=30/3=10 ) valid- ( k=6 ): ( r=36/2=18 ) valid- ( k=7 ): ( r=42/1=42 ) validSo, four valid pairs: (4,6), (5,10), (6,18), (7,42)But wait, if I consider the ratio the other way around, i.e., ( frac{k}{r} = frac{4}{3} ), then I would have:[frac{(k - 2)/k}{(r - 2)/r} = frac{4}{3}]Which leads to:[frac{(k - 2)r}{(r - 2)k} = frac{4}{3}]Cross-multiplying:[3(k - 2)r = 4(r - 2)k]Expanding:[3kr - 6r = 4kr - 8k]Bringing all terms to one side:[3kr - 6r - 4kr + 8k = 0]Simplify:[- kr - 6r + 8k = 0]Factor:[- r(k + 6) + 8k = 0]So,[r(k + 6) = 8k]Thus,[r = frac{8k}{k + 6}]Now, ( r ) must be an integer, so ( k + 6 ) must divide ( 8k ). Let's test possible ( k ):- ( k=3 ): ( r=24/9=2.666 ) invalid- ( k=4 ): ( r=32/10=3.2 ) invalid- ( k=5 ): ( r=40/11‚âà3.636 ) invalid- ( k=6 ): ( r=48/12=4 ) valid- ( k=7 ): ( r=56/13‚âà4.307 ) invalid- ( k=8 ): ( r=64/14‚âà4.571 ) invalid- ( k=9 ): ( r=72/15=4.8 ) invalid- ( k=10 ): ( r=80/16=5 ) valid- ( k=11 ): ( r=88/17‚âà5.176 ) invalid- ( k=12 ): ( r=96/18=5.333 ) invalid- ( k=13 ): ( r=104/19‚âà5.473 ) invalid- ( k=14 ): ( r=112/20=5.6 ) invalid- ( k=15 ): ( r=120/21‚âà5.714 ) invalid- ( k=16 ): ( r=128/22‚âà5.818 ) invalid- ( k=17 ): ( r=136/23‚âà5.913 ) invalid- ( k=18 ): ( r=144/24=6 ) validWait, so when ( k=6 ), ( r=4 ); when ( k=10 ), ( r=5 ); when ( k=18 ), ( r=6 ). But these are just the reverse of the previous pairs: (6,4), (10,5), (18,6). So, these are duplicates of the earlier pairs.Therefore, in total, considering both directions, I have four unique pairs: (4,6), (5,10), (6,18), (7,42). So, four pairs.But the answer choices only go up to D)4, so I think that's the answer. However, the initial answer provided was B)2, which suggests that maybe I'm overcounting.Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the polygons must have more than 3 sides, but that's already the case. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the ratio.Wait, the ratio is 4:3, so it's fixed. So, if I have two polygons, one with interior angle 4x and the other with 3x, the ratio is 4:3. So, in my first approach, I considered the first polygon as 4x and the second as 3x, leading to four pairs. But perhaps the problem is considering only convex polygons, which they are, since regular polygons are convex.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the number of sides must be greater than or equal to 3, which they are.Wait, but in my first approach, I got four pairs, but the answer choices only go up to D)4, so I think that's correct.But wait, let me check the problem again: \\"Two regular polygons have sides of unit length, and the ratio of their interior angles is 4:3. How many such pairs of polygons exist?\\"So, it's about pairs, so unordered pairs. So, if I have (4,6), (5,10), (6,18), (7,42), these are four distinct unordered pairs because each pair has a different combination of sides. So, four pairs.But the answer choices are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)infinite.So, the answer should be D)4.But the initial answer provided was B)2, which suggests that maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the polygons must have more than 3 sides, but that's already the case. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the ratio.Wait, perhaps the ratio is 4:3, meaning that one angle is 4 parts and the other is 3 parts, but the total must be 7 parts. But that's not necessarily the case because the ratio is just 4:3, not parts of a whole.Wait, no, the ratio is just 4:3, so one angle is 4/3 times the other.Wait, let me check the calculations again.From the first ratio:[frac{(r - 2)/r}{(k - 2)/k} = frac{4}{3}]Which simplifies to:[frac{(r - 2)k}{(k - 2)r} = frac{4}{3}]Cross-multiplying:[3(r - 2)k = 4(k - 2)r]Expanding:[3rk - 6k = 4kr - 8r]Bringing all terms to one side:[3rk - 6k - 4kr + 8r = 0]Simplify:[- rk - 6k + 8r = 0]Which is:[rk + 6k - 8r = 0]Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign when moving terms. Let me check:From:[3rk - 6k = 4kr - 8r]Subtract ( 4kr ) and add ( 8r ) to both sides:[3rk - 6k - 4kr + 8r = 0]Which simplifies to:[- rk - 6k + 8r = 0]Factor:[- rk + 8r - 6k = 0]Factor out ( r ) from the first two terms:[r(-k + 8) - 6k = 0]Which is:[r(8 - k) = 6k]So,[r = frac{6k}{8 - k}]So, ( 8 - k ) must be a positive integer, so ( k < 8 ). So, ( k ) can be 3,4,5,6,7.Testing these:- ( k=3 ): ( r=18/5=3.6 ) invalid- ( k=4 ): ( r=24/4=6 ) valid- ( k=5 ): ( r=30/3=10 ) valid- ( k=6 ): ( r=36/2=18 ) valid- ( k=7 ): ( r=42/1=42 ) validSo, four valid pairs: (4,6), (5,10), (6,18), (7,42)Therefore, the answer is D)4.But the initial answer provided was B)2, which suggests that maybe I'm overcounting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the polygons must have more than 3 sides, but that's already the case. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the ratio.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio is 4:3, meaning that one angle is 4/3 times the other, but not necessarily in a specific order. So, if I consider both possibilities, I might get more pairs, but in reality, each pair is unique based on the number of sides.But in my calculation, I already considered both directions by setting up the ratio both ways, leading to four pairs. So, I think the correct answer is D)4.However, the initial answer provided was B)2, which suggests that maybe the problem is considering only convex polygons with sides greater than 3, but that's already the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the polygons must have sides greater than 4, but that's not specified.Wait, no, the problem just says regular polygons with unit length sides, so any number of sides greater than or equal to 3 is fine.Therefore, I think the correct answer is D)4."},{"question":"Given that the point (a, b) is on the graph of y = log_{10} x, where a neq 1, which of the following points is also on this graph?A: ( frac{1}{a}, b )B: (10a, 1 - b)C: ( frac{10}{a}, b + 1)D: (a^{2}, 2b)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where the point (a, b) is on the graph of y = log base 10 of x, and a is not equal to 1. I need to figure out which of the given points A, B, C, or D is also on this graph. Let me think through this step by step.First, since (a, b) is on the graph of y = log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄx, that means when x is a, y is b. So, mathematically, that translates to b = log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa. Got that down. So, b is the logarithm base 10 of a. That‚Äôs the starting point.Now, I need to check each of the options A, B, C, D to see if their coordinates satisfy the equation y = log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄx. Let me go through each one.Starting with option A: (1/a, b). So, the x-coordinate here is 1/a, and the y-coordinate is still b. I need to check if b equals log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(1/a). Let me compute log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(1/a). Remember that log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(1/a) is equal to log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(a‚Åª¬π), which is the same as -log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa. Since we know that log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa is b, this becomes -b. So, log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(1/a) is -b, but the y-coordinate here is b. So, unless b is zero, which it isn't because a ‚â† 1 (since log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ1 is 0), this doesn't hold. Therefore, option A is not correct.Moving on to option B: (10a, 1 - b). So, x is 10a, and y is 1 - b. Let me compute log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(10a). Using logarithm properties, log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(10a) is log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ10 + log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa. Log base 10 of 10 is 1, and log base 10 of a is b. So, this becomes 1 + b. But the y-coordinate here is 1 - b. So, unless b is zero, which it isn't, 1 + b is not equal to 1 - b. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.Next is option C: (10/a, b + 1). So, x is 10/a, and y is b + 1. Let's compute log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(10/a). Again, using logarithm properties, this is log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ10 - log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa. Log base 10 of 10 is 1, and log base 10 of a is b. So, this becomes 1 - b. But the y-coordinate here is b + 1. So, 1 - b is not equal to b + 1 unless b is zero, which it isn't. Therefore, option C is incorrect as well.Finally, option D: (a¬≤, 2b). So, x is a squared, and y is 2b. Let me compute log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(a¬≤). Using logarithm properties, this is 2 log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa. Since log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa is b, this becomes 2b. So, log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(a¬≤) is 2b, which matches the y-coordinate given in option D. Therefore, option D is correct.Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For option A, log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(1/a) is indeed -log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa, which is -b, so that's not equal to b. For option B, log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(10a) is 1 + b, not 1 - b. For option C, log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(10/a) is 1 - b, not b + 1. And for option D, log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(a¬≤) is 2 log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄa, which is 2b. Yep, that all checks out.So, after going through each option, it seems like option D is the only one that satisfies the equation y = log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄx given the original point (a, b). Therefore, the correct answer should be D."},{"question":"Bill is trying to control the pests in his garden. Each spider he introduces eats 7 bugs, and each time he sprays the garden he reduces the total bug population to 80% of what it was previously. The garden has a certain number of bugs to start, and Bill sprays once and introduces 12 spiders. There are 236 bugs left. How many bugs were in the garden initially?","answer":"First, I need to determine the initial number of bugs in the garden, which I'll call ( B ).Bill sprays the garden, reducing the bug population to 80% of its original number. This means after spraying, the number of bugs becomes ( 0.8B ).Next, Bill introduces 12 spiders, and each spider eats 7 bugs. Therefore, the total number of bugs eaten by the spiders is ( 12 times 7 = 84 ) bugs.After the spiders have eaten, the number of bugs remaining in the garden is ( 0.8B - 84 ).According to the problem, there are 236 bugs left after these actions.

For x less than 1, it's sin(x), and for x greater than or equal to 1, it's a cubic polynomial: x¬≥ - 9x¬≤ + 25x + a. The question is asking for the set of values for the real number a such that the graph of f(x) intersects the line y = x at three distinct points.Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. We have two parts of the function: one is sin(x) for x < 1, and the other is a cubic polynomial for x ‚â• 1. We need to find the values of a so that when we plot f(x), it crosses the line y = x three times.First, let's think about the intersections. The line y = x is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 1. So, the intersections between f(x) and y = x occur where f(x) = x.So, for x < 1, f(x) = sin(x). So, the equation becomes sin(x) = x. I remember that sin(x) intersects y = x at x = 0 because sin(0) = 0. But does it intersect anywhere else for x < 1?Let me think. The function sin(x) is equal to x only at x = 0 because for x > 0, sin(x) is always less than x. For example, at x = œÄ/2, sin(œÄ/2) = 1, but œÄ/2 is approximately 1.57, which is greater than 1. So, sin(x) is less than x for x > 0. Therefore, the only intersection point for x < 1 is at x = 0.So, that's one intersection point. Now, we need two more intersection points from the other part of the function, which is the cubic polynomial for x ‚â• 1.So, for x ‚â• 1, f(x) = x¬≥ - 9x¬≤ + 25x + a. We need to find when this equals x, so set up the equation:x¬≥ - 9x¬≤ + 25x + a = xSubtract x from both sides:x¬≥ - 9x¬≤ + 24x + a = 0So, we have the equation x¬≥ - 9x¬≤ + 24x + a = 0, and we need this to have two distinct real roots for x ‚â• 1. Because we already have one intersection at x = 0, we need two more from the cubic part to make a total of three.Now, to find the number of real roots of the cubic equation x¬≥ - 9x¬≤ + 24x + a = 0, we can analyze its graph. Since it's a cubic, it will have at least one real root, but depending on its critical points, it can have up to three real roots.To find the critical points, we take the derivative of the cubic function:g(x) = x¬≥ - 9x¬≤ + 24x + ag'(x) = 3x¬≤ - 18x + 24We can factor this derivative:g'(x) = 3(x¬≤ - 6x + 8) = 3(x - 2)(x - 4)So, the critical points are at x = 2 and x = 4. These are the points where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.Let me note the behavior of g(x):- For x < 2, the derivative g'(x) is positive because if we plug in a value less than 2, say x = 1, g'(1) = 3(1 - 2)(1 - 4) = 3(-1)(-3) = 9, which is positive. So, the function is increasing on (-‚àû, 2).- Between x = 2 and x = 4, the derivative is negative. For example, at x = 3, g'(3) = 3(3 - 2)(3 - 4) = 3(1)(-1) = -3, which is negative. So, the function is decreasing on (2, 4).- For x > 4, the derivative is positive again. At x = 5, g'(5) = 3(5 - 2)(5 - 4) = 3(3)(1) = 9, positive. So, the function is increasing on (4, ‚àû).Therefore, the function g(x) has a local maximum at x = 2 and a local minimum at x = 4.Now, since we are interested in x ‚â• 1, let's evaluate g(x) at these critical points and at x = 1.First, compute g(1):g(1) = (1)¬≥ - 9(1)¬≤ + 24(1) + a = 1 - 9 + 24 + a = 16 + aNext, compute g(2):g(2) = (8) - 9(4) + 24(2) + a = 8 - 36 + 48 + a = 20 + aThen, compute g(4):g(4) = (64) - 9(16) + 24(4) + a = 64 - 144 + 96 + a = 16 + aSo, we have:- At x = 1: g(1) = 16 + a- At x = 2: g(2) = 20 + a- At x = 4: g(4) = 16 + aInteresting, so g(1) and g(4) are both equal to 16 + a, and g(2) is 20 + a.Now, since the function is increasing from x = 1 to x = 2, then decreasing from x = 2 to x = 4, and then increasing again beyond x = 4.We need the equation g(x) = 0 to have two distinct real roots for x ‚â• 1. Since it's a cubic, it can have one or three real roots, but since we're only considering x ‚â• 1, we need two intersections here.For the equation g(x) = 0 to have two real roots in x ‚â• 1, the function must cross the x-axis twice. Given the behavior of g(x), which increases to x = 2, then decreases to x = 4, and then increases again, the function must have a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below the x-axis, or vice versa.Wait, actually, for two real roots in x ‚â• 1, the function must cross the x-axis once between x = 1 and x = 2, and once again after x = 4. Alternatively, it could have a double root and another root, but since we need two distinct points, it's more likely that it crosses twice.But let's think about the values at the critical points.At x = 2, which is a local maximum, g(2) = 20 + a.At x = 4, which is a local minimum, g(4) = 16 + a.To have two real roots in x ‚â• 1, the function must cross the x-axis once before the local maximum and once after the local minimum. So, for that to happen, the local maximum must be above the x-axis, and the local minimum must be below the x-axis.Wait, actually, let me think again. If the function is increasing from x = 1 to x = 2, then decreasing from x = 2 to x = 4, then increasing again.If at x = 1, g(1) = 16 + a, and at x = 2, g(2) = 20 + a, which is higher, then at x = 4, g(4) = 16 + a, same as at x = 1, and then it increases again beyond x = 4.So, for the function to cross the x-axis twice in x ‚â• 1, the value at x = 2 must be positive, and the value at x = 4 must be negative, or vice versa?Wait, actually, if the function is increasing from x = 1 to x = 2, then decreasing from x = 2 to x = 4, then increasing again.If at x = 2, the function is positive, and at x = 4, it's also positive, then the function might not cross the x-axis at all in x ‚â• 1, unless it starts below the x-axis at x = 1.Wait, let's think about the sign of g(x) at x = 1, x = 2, and x = 4.We have:g(1) = 16 + ag(2) = 20 + ag(4) = 16 + aSo, if g(1) is positive, then g(2) is more positive, and g(4) is the same as g(1). So, if all these are positive, then the function is positive at x = 1, peaks at x = 2, dips back to the same value at x = 4, and then increases again. So, if all are positive, the function doesn't cross the x-axis in x ‚â• 1.If g(1) is negative, then g(2) is more negative, but wait, g(2) is 20 + a, which is higher than g(1) = 16 + a. So, if g(1) is negative, g(2) is less negative, and then at x = 4, it's back to g(4) = 16 + a, which is the same as g(1). So, if g(1) is negative, the function starts negative at x = 1, goes less negative at x = 2, then back to the same negative value at x = 4, and then increases beyond x = 4.So, in this case, if g(4) is negative, then beyond x = 4, the function is increasing, so it will cross the x-axis once after x = 4. But between x = 1 and x = 4, it might not cross because it's going from negative to less negative to negative again.Wait, but hold on, if g(1) is negative, and g(2) is less negative, and g(4) is negative again, but the function is increasing from x = 1 to x = 2, then decreasing from x = 2 to x = 4. So, if g(1) is negative and g(2) is less negative, but still negative, then the function doesn't cross the x-axis between x = 1 and x = 2. Then, from x = 2 to x = 4, it goes back to the same negative value, so it doesn't cross there either. Then, beyond x = 4, it starts increasing, so if g(4) is negative, it will cross the x-axis once after x = 4.But we need two crossings in x ‚â• 1, so that would require another crossing somewhere else.Wait, maybe I need to consider the behavior as x approaches infinity. As x approaches infinity, the leading term x¬≥ dominates, so g(x) tends to infinity. So, if g(4) is negative, then beyond x = 4, the function will go from negative to positive, crossing the x-axis once. But we need two crossings.Alternatively, if g(2) is positive and g(4) is negative, then the function goes from positive at x = 2 to negative at x = 4, crossing the x-axis once between x = 2 and x = 4, and then beyond x = 4, it goes back up, crossing again. But wait, that would be two crossings: one between x = 2 and x = 4, and another after x = 4.But we also have the interval from x = 1 to x = 2. If g(1) is positive, then from x = 1 to x = 2, the function is increasing, so it remains positive, not crossing. If g(1) is negative, then from x = 1 to x = 2, the function goes from negative to positive (if g(2) is positive), crossing the x-axis once between x = 1 and x = 2.So, to have two crossings in x ‚â• 1, we need:1. The function crosses from negative to positive between x = 1 and x = 2, which requires g(1) < 0 and g(2) > 0.2. Then, it goes back down from positive at x = 2 to negative at x = 4, crossing the x-axis again between x = 2 and x = 4.3. Then, beyond x = 4, it goes back up, crossing the x-axis a third time. But wait, we only need two crossings in x ‚â• 1 because we already have one at x = 0.Wait, no. The total number of intersections is three: one at x = 0, and two from the cubic part. So, the cubic part needs to cross the x-axis twice in x ‚â• 1.So, for the cubic part to cross the x-axis twice in x ‚â• 1, we need:- The function to cross once between x = 1 and x = 2, and once between x = 2 and x = 4.Or,- The function to cross once between x = 2 and x = 4, and once after x = 4.But given the behavior, if the function is positive at x = 2 and negative at x = 4, it will cross once between x = 2 and x = 4, and then again after x = 4.Alternatively, if the function is negative at x = 1 and positive at x = 2, it will cross once between x = 1 and x = 2, and then again between x = 2 and x = 4 if it goes back down.Wait, let me think step by step.Case 1: g(1) < 0 and g(2) > 0.This would mean that between x = 1 and x = 2, the function crosses from negative to positive, so one root there.Then, since at x = 2, it's positive, and at x = 4, it's back to g(4) = 16 + a. If g(4) is negative, then between x = 2 and x = 4, the function goes from positive to negative, crossing again. So, that's two roots: one between 1 and 2, another between 2 and 4.Then, beyond x = 4, since the function is increasing, it goes from negative at x = 4 to positive as x approaches infinity, so it crosses again after x = 4. But we only need two crossings in x ‚â• 1 because we already have one at x = 0.Wait, but the problem says the graph intersects y = x at three distinct points. So, if the cubic part crosses twice, that's two more points, making a total of three.But in this case, if g(1) < 0 and g(2) > 0 and g(4) < 0, then the cubic part crosses three times: once between 1 and 2, once between 2 and 4, and once after 4. But that would make the total intersections four: one at x = 0, and three from the cubic. But the problem says three distinct points.Wait, maybe I need to adjust my thinking.Wait, no. The function f(x) is defined as sin(x) for x < 1 and the cubic for x ‚â• 1. So, the intersection at x = 0 is from the sin(x) part. Then, the cubic part can intersect y = x at two points: one between x = 1 and x = 2, and another between x = 2 and x = 4, or one between x = 2 and x = 4 and another after x = 4.But if the cubic part crosses three times, that would be three intersections, making the total four. But the problem says three distinct points, so the cubic part must cross exactly twice.Therefore, we need the cubic part to cross the x-axis exactly twice in x ‚â• 1.To have exactly two real roots in x ‚â• 1, the function must touch the x-axis at one point (a double root) and cross at another, or cross twice without any tangency.But since the function is a cubic, it's more likely that it can have two real roots if it has a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below the x-axis, or vice versa.Wait, let me recall that for a cubic function, the number of real roots depends on the relative positions of the local maximum and minimum with respect to the x-axis.If the local maximum is above the x-axis and the local minimum is below the x-axis, then the cubic has three real roots.If both the local maximum and minimum are above the x-axis, or both below, then the cubic has only one real root.But in our case, we need the cubic part to have two real roots in x ‚â• 1. However, since the cubic is defined for all x, but we are only considering x ‚â• 1, it's possible that one of the roots is at x = 1 or beyond.Wait, maybe I should consider the function g(x) = x¬≥ - 9x¬≤ + 24x + a. We need g(x) = 0 to have two real roots in x ‚â• 1.But since g(x) is a cubic, it can have one or three real roots. So, if it has three real roots, two of them could be in x ‚â• 1, and one in x < 1. But since we are only considering x ‚â• 1, we need the cubic to have two roots in x ‚â• 1.Alternatively, if the cubic has a double root in x ‚â• 1 and another root elsewhere, but that might complicate things.Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that the function g(x) has a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below the x-axis, so that it crosses the x-axis three times, but since we are only considering x ‚â• 1, two of those crossings are in x ‚â• 1.But in that case, the total number of intersections would be three: one at x = 0, and two from the cubic. But if the cubic crosses three times, that would make four intersections. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Alternatively, perhaps the cubic part only needs to cross the x-axis twice in x ‚â• 1, regardless of the overall number of roots.So, to have two crossings in x ‚â• 1, the function must cross the x-axis once between x = 1 and x = 2, and once between x = 2 and x = 4, or once between x = 2 and x = 4, and once after x = 4.But let's think about the values:We have g(1) = 16 + ag(2) = 20 + ag(4) = 16 + aSo, if we want the function to cross the x-axis once between x = 1 and x = 2, and once between x = 2 and x = 4, we need:g(1) < 0, g(2) > 0, and g(4) < 0.Similarly, if we want it to cross once between x = 2 and x = 4, and once after x = 4, we need:g(2) > 0, g(4) < 0.But in that case, the function would cross between x = 2 and x = 4, and then again after x = 4, making two crossings.But wait, if g(1) is positive, then from x = 1 to x = 2, the function is increasing, so it remains positive, not crossing. Then, from x = 2 to x = 4, it decreases. If g(4) is negative, then it crosses once between x = 2 and x = 4, and then again after x = 4.So, in this case, we have two crossings in x ‚â• 1: one between x = 2 and x = 4, and another after x = 4.Alternatively, if g(1) is negative, g(2) is positive, and g(4) is negative, then we have crossings between x = 1 and x = 2, and between x = 2 and x = 4.So, in both cases, we can have two crossings in x ‚â• 1.But the problem is that if g(1) is negative, g(2) is positive, and g(4) is negative, then the function crosses three times: once between 1 and 2, once between 2 and 4, and once after 4. But we only need two crossings in x ‚â• 1 because we already have one at x = 0.Wait, no. The total number of intersections is three: one at x = 0, and two from the cubic part. So, the cubic part needs to cross exactly twice in x ‚â• 1.Therefore, we need to ensure that the cubic part crosses exactly twice in x ‚â• 1, which can happen in two scenarios:1. The function crosses once between x = 1 and x = 2, and once between x = 2 and x = 4.2. The function crosses once between x = 2 and x = 4, and once after x = 4.But in the first scenario, if g(1) < 0, g(2) > 0, and g(4) < 0, then the function crosses three times: once between 1 and 2, once between 2 and 4, and once after 4. That would give us three crossings in x ‚â• 1, which is more than we need.Wait, no. The function is defined as sin(x) for x < 1, so the crossing at x = 0 is from the sin(x) part. The cubic part is only for x ‚â• 1, so any crossings in x ‚â• 1 are only from the cubic. So, if the cubic crosses twice in x ‚â• 1, that's two more intersections, making a total of three.But if the cubic crosses three times in x ‚â• 1, that would make four intersections, which is more than needed.Therefore, we need the cubic part to cross exactly twice in x ‚â• 1.So, how can we ensure that?Well, if the function g(x) has a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below the x-axis, it will cross three times. But we need it to cross exactly twice in x ‚â• 1.Wait, perhaps if one of the roots is exactly at x = 1 or x = 2 or x = 4, making it a double root.Wait, let me think about the conditions.If g(1) = 0, then x = 1 is a root. Similarly, if g(2) = 0 or g(4) = 0, then x = 2 or x = 4 is a root.So, if we set g(1) = 0, then 16 + a = 0 => a = -16.Similarly, if g(2) = 0, then 20 + a = 0 => a = -20.And if g(4) = 0, then 16 + a = 0 => a = -16.So, if a = -16, then g(1) = 0 and g(4) = 0.If a = -20, then g(2) = 0.So, let's analyze these cases.Case 1: a = -16.Then, g(1) = 0 and g(4) = 0.So, the function g(x) has roots at x = 1 and x = 4.But since it's a cubic, there must be a third root.Given that g(x) has a local maximum at x = 2 and a local minimum at x = 4.Wait, but if g(4) = 0, and it's a local minimum, then the function touches the x-axis at x = 4, making it a double root.Similarly, at x = 1, g(1) = 0, which is a simple root.So, in this case, the function crosses the x-axis at x = 1, touches at x = 4, and has another root somewhere else.But since we are considering x ‚â• 1, the roots are at x = 1 and x = 4 (double root). So, does that count as two distinct points?Wait, x = 4 is a double root, so it's a single point where the function touches the x-axis. So, in x ‚â• 1, we have two distinct intersection points: one at x = 1 and one at x = 4 (but it's a double root, so it's just one point). Wait, no, a double root is still one point, but with multiplicity two.But the problem says three distinct points. So, if a = -16, the cubic part intersects y = x at x = 1 and x = 4 (double root). So, in total, we have x = 0, x = 1, and x = 4. But x = 4 is a double root, so it's still just one point. So, total intersections are three: x = 0, x = 1, and x = 4. But x = 4 is a double root, so it's just one point. So, that's three distinct points.Wait, but the problem says three distinct points, so a = -16 is acceptable.Similarly, if a = -20, then g(2) = 0.So, g(2) = 0, which is a root.But since it's a local maximum, if g(2) = 0, the function touches the x-axis at x = 2, making it a double root.Then, the function would have another root somewhere else.Given that g(1) = 16 + a = 16 - 20 = -4 < 0, and g(4) = 16 + a = -4 < 0.So, at x = 1, g(1) = -4, and at x = 4, g(4) = -4.Since the function is increasing from x = 1 to x = 2, starting at -4 and going up to 0 at x = 2.Then, decreasing from x = 2 to x = 4, going back down to -4.Then, increasing again beyond x = 4.So, in this case, the function crosses the x-axis at x = 2 (double root) and somewhere after x = 4.So, in x ‚â• 1, we have two distinct intersection points: x = 2 (double root) and another after x = 4.But x = 2 is a double root, so it's just one point. So, total intersections are x = 0, x = 2, and x = something after 4. So, three distinct points.Therefore, both a = -16 and a = -20 result in the function f(x) intersecting y = x at three distinct points.Wait, but let me verify.For a = -16:- The cubic part has roots at x = 1 and x = 4 (double root). So, in x ‚â• 1, we have x = 1 and x = 4. But x = 4 is a double root, so it's just one point. So, total intersections: x = 0, x = 1, x = 4. Three distinct points.For a = -20:- The cubic part has a double root at x = 2 and another root after x = 4. So, in x ‚â• 1, we have x = 2 and x = something after 4. So, total intersections: x = 0, x = 2, x = something after 4. Three distinct points.Therefore, both a = -16 and a = -20 are valid.But wait, is there any other value of a that can result in two distinct crossings in x ‚â• 1?Suppose a is between -20 and -16.Let me pick a = -18.Then, g(1) = 16 - 18 = -2 < 0g(2) = 20 - 18 = 2 > 0g(4) = 16 - 18 = -2 < 0So, the function crosses from negative to positive between x = 1 and x = 2, then from positive to negative between x = 2 and x = 4, and then from negative to positive after x = 4.So, in x ‚â• 1, it crosses three times: once between 1 and 2, once between 2 and 4, and once after 4. That would make four intersections in total: x = 0, and three from the cubic. But the problem says three distinct points, so a = -18 is not acceptable.Similarly, if a is less than -20, say a = -21.Then, g(1) = 16 - 21 = -5 < 0g(2) = 20 - 21 = -1 < 0g(4) = 16 - 21 = -5 < 0So, the function is negative at x = 1, x = 2, and x = 4. Since it's increasing from x = 1 to x = 2, but remains negative, then decreasing from x = 2 to x = 4, still negative, and then increasing beyond x = 4. So, it will cross the x-axis once after x = 4. So, only one crossing in x ‚â• 1, making total intersections two: x = 0 and x = something after 4. Not enough.If a is greater than -16, say a = -15.Then, g(1) = 16 - 15 = 1 > 0g(2) = 20 - 15 = 5 > 0g(4) = 16 - 15 = 1 > 0So, the function is positive at x = 1, x = 2, and x = 4. Since it's increasing from x = 1 to x = 2, then decreasing from x = 2 to x = 4, but remains positive. Then, increasing again beyond x = 4. So, it doesn't cross the x-axis in x ‚â• 1. So, only one intersection at x = 0. Not enough.Therefore, the only values of a that result in exactly two crossings in x ‚â• 1, making the total intersections three, are a = -16 and a = -20.So, the set of values for a is {-20, -16}."},{"question":"The sides of a rectangle are in the ratio 4 : 3 and its area is a certain value. The perimeter of the rectangle is 126. What is the area of the rectangle in sq. m?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle where the sides are in the ratio 4:3, and the perimeter is 126 meters. I need to find the area of the rectangle in square meters. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Since the sides are in the ratio 4:3, I can probably represent the length and width as multiples of some variable.Let me think, if the ratio is 4:3, maybe I can let the length be 4x and the width be 3x, where x is a common multiplier. That makes sense because 4x and 3x will always be in the ratio 4:3 no matter what x is. Now, the perimeter is given as 126 meters. So, using the formula for perimeter, which is 2*(length + width), I can set up an equation.So, plugging in the values, it would be 2*(4x + 3x) = 126. Simplifying inside the parentheses first, 4x + 3x is 7x. So, the equation becomes 2*7x = 126, which is 14x = 126. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 14. So, x = 126 / 14. Let me do that division: 14 goes into 126 nine times because 14*9 is 126. So, x equals 9.Now that I have x, I can find the actual length and width of the rectangle. The length is 4x, so that's 4*9, which is 36 meters. The width is 3x, so that's 3*9, which is 27 meters. Okay, so the rectangle is 36 meters long and 27 meters wide.Next, I need to find the area of the rectangle. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, that would be 36 meters multiplied by 27 meters. Let me calculate that. 36 times 27... Hmm, 36 times 20 is 720, and 36 times 7 is 252. Adding those together, 720 + 252 equals 972. So, the area is 972 square meters.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the perimeter: 2*(36 + 27) should equal 126. 36 + 27 is 63, and 2*63 is indeed 126. Okay, that checks out. And for the area, 36*27, I can verify that as well. 36*27 is the same as (30 + 6)*27, which is 30*27 + 6*27. 30*27 is 810, and 6*27 is 162. Adding those together gives 810 + 162 = 972. Yep, that's correct.So, everything seems to add up. The sides are in the correct ratio, the perimeter matches the given value, and the area calculation is accurate. I think I've got it right."},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, it is known that a_1 = 2, and a_2 cdot a_3 = 32.

First, the problem says that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, a‚ÇÅ is 2, and the product of a‚ÇÇ and a‚ÇÉ is 32. I need to find the sum of the first six terms, S‚ÇÜ. The options are A: 62, B: 64, C: 126, D: 128.Alright, let's recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted by q. So, the nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as a_n = a‚ÇÅ * q^(n-1).Given that a‚ÇÅ = 2, so the first term is 2. Then, a‚ÇÇ would be a‚ÇÅ * q, which is 2q. Similarly, a‚ÇÉ would be a‚ÇÇ * q, which is 2q¬≤. The problem says that a‚ÇÇ multiplied by a‚ÇÉ is 32. So, let's write that down:a‚ÇÇ * a‚ÇÉ = 32Substituting the expressions we have:(2q) * (2q¬≤) = 32Let me compute that:2q * 2q¬≤ = 4q¬≥ = 32So, 4q¬≥ = 32To find q, I can divide both sides by 4:q¬≥ = 8Then, take the cube root of both sides:q = 2Okay, so the common ratio q is 2. Now, I need to find the sum of the first six terms, S‚ÇÜ.The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is:S_n = a‚ÇÅ * (1 - q^n) / (1 - q)Let me make sure I remember that correctly. Yes, when q ‚â† 1, the sum is given by that formula.So, plugging in the values:a‚ÇÅ = 2, q = 2, n = 6S‚ÇÜ = 2 * (1 - 2‚Å∂) / (1 - 2)Let me compute 2‚Å∂ first. 2‚Å∂ is 64.So, 1 - 64 is -63.Then, the denominator is 1 - 2, which is -1.So, putting it all together:S‚ÇÜ = 2 * (-63) / (-1)Dividing -63 by -1 gives 63.Then, 2 * 63 is 126.So, S‚ÇÜ is 126.Looking back at the options, C is 126, so that should be the answer.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I found a‚ÇÇ and a‚ÇÉ correctly as 2q and 2q¬≤.2. Their product is 4q¬≥ = 32, leading to q¬≥ = 8, so q = 2. That seems right.3. Then, using the sum formula: S‚ÇÜ = 2*(1 - 64)/(-1) = 2*(-63)/(-1) = 126. Yep, that looks correct.I think I did everything properly. So, I'm confident that 126 is the right answer.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=sin (omega x+phi )(omega > 0,|phi | < frac{pi }{2}) has a minimum positive period of pi, and its graph is shifted to the left by frac{pi }{3} units to obtain the graph of the function g(x)=cos omega x, then the graph of the function f(x) is (¬†¬†¬†¬†)A: Symmetric about the line x=frac{pi }{12}B: Symmetric about the line x=frac{5pi }{12}C: Symmetric about the point (frac{pi }{12},0)D: Symmetric about the point (frac{5pi }{12},0)","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a function f(x) = sin(œâx + œÜ). It says that the minimum positive period is œÄ, and when the graph is shifted to the left by œÄ/3 units, it becomes g(x) = cos(œâx). Then I need to figure out the symmetry of the graph of f(x) from the given options.First, I remember that the period of a sine function is given by 2œÄ divided by the frequency œâ. Since the period is œÄ, I can set up the equation:2œÄ / œâ = œÄSolving for œâ, I divide both sides by œÄ:2 / œâ = 1So œâ = 2. Got that down.Now, the function f(x) = sin(2x + œÜ). The graph is shifted to the left by œÄ/3 to get g(x) = cos(2x). Shifting a function left by œÄ/3 means replacing x with x + œÄ/3 in the function. So:g(x) = f(x + œÄ/3) = sin(2(x + œÄ/3) + œÜ) = sin(2x + 2œÄ/3 + œÜ)But we know that g(x) is also equal to cos(2x). So:sin(2x + 2œÄ/3 + œÜ) = cos(2x)I remember that sin(Œ∏) = cos(Œ∏ - œÄ/2). So, I can rewrite the left side as:cos(2x + 2œÄ/3 + œÜ - œÄ/2) = cos(2x)For these two cosine functions to be equal for all x, their arguments must differ by an integer multiple of 2œÄ or be negatives of each other plus an integer multiple of 2œÄ. So:2x + 2œÄ/3 + œÜ - œÄ/2 = 2x + 2œÄk, where k is an integerSubtracting 2x from both sides:2œÄ/3 + œÜ - œÄ/2 = 2œÄkSimplify the constants:2œÄ/3 - œÄ/2 = (4œÄ/6 - 3œÄ/6) = œÄ/6So:œÄ/6 + œÜ = 2œÄkTherefore, œÜ = -œÄ/6 + 2œÄkBut the problem states that |œÜ| < œÄ/2, so the only possible value is when k = 0:œÜ = -œÄ/6So, f(x) = sin(2x - œÄ/6)Now, I need to check the symmetry of this function. The options are about symmetry about certain lines or points.First, let's recall that sine functions are symmetric about their midlines and have certain symmetries depending on their phase shifts.The function f(x) = sin(2x - œÄ/6) can be rewritten as sin(2(x - œÄ/12)). So, it's a sine wave with frequency 2, shifted to the right by œÄ/12.Sine functions are symmetric about their midpoints. The midline is y = 0, so the symmetry would be about points where the function crosses the midline.Let me find the points where f(x) = 0:sin(2x - œÄ/6) = 0So, 2x - œÄ/6 = nœÄ, where n is an integer.Solving for x:2x = nœÄ + œÄ/6x = (nœÄ + œÄ/6)/2 = nœÄ/2 + œÄ/12So, the function crosses the x-axis at x = œÄ/12, 7œÄ/12, 13œÄ/12, etc.This suggests that the function is symmetric about these points. So, for example, it's symmetric about (œÄ/12, 0), (7œÄ/12, 0), etc.Looking at the options, option C is symmetry about the point (œÄ/12, 0), which seems to fit.To double-check, let's consider the symmetry about a point. If a function is symmetric about a point (a, b), then for any h, f(a + h) - b = b - f(a - h).In our case, b = 0, so f(a + h) = -f(a - h).Let's test a = œÄ/12:f(œÄ/12 + h) = sin(2(œÄ/12 + h) - œÄ/6) = sin(œÄ/6 + 2h - œÄ/6) = sin(2h)f(œÄ/12 - h) = sin(2(œÄ/12 - h) - œÄ/6) = sin(œÄ/6 - 2h - œÄ/6) = sin(-2h) = -sin(2h)So, f(œÄ/12 + h) = sin(2h) and -f(œÄ/12 - h) = sin(2h). Therefore, f(œÄ/12 + h) = -f(œÄ/12 - h), which confirms that the function is symmetric about the point (œÄ/12, 0).Therefore, the correct answer is option C."},{"question":"Given that sin alpha tan alpha = frac{3}{2}, and 0 < alpha < pi.(1) Find the value of alpha;(2) Find the range of the function f(x) = 4 cos x cos (x - alpha) on [0, frac{pi}{4}].","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given that sin Œ± times tan Œ± equals 3/2, and Œ± is between 0 and œÄ. I need to find the value of Œ± first, and then find the range of a function f(x) = 4 cos x cos(x - Œ±) on the interval [0, œÄ/4]. Hmm, let's start with part (1).Alright, so I know that tan Œ± is sin Œ± over cos Œ±, right? So if I substitute that into the equation, I get sin Œ± times (sin Œ± / cos Œ±) equals 3/2. That simplifies to sin¬≤ Œ± / cos Œ± = 3/2. Hmm, okay, so maybe I can rewrite this as 2 sin¬≤ Œ± = 3 cos Œ±. That seems manageable.Now, I remember that sin¬≤ Œ± can be written in terms of cos Œ± using the Pythagorean identity. So sin¬≤ Œ± is 1 - cos¬≤ Œ±. Let me substitute that in. So, 2(1 - cos¬≤ Œ±) = 3 cos Œ±. Expanding that, I get 2 - 2 cos¬≤ Œ± = 3 cos Œ±. Hmm, let's rearrange this equation to form a quadratic in terms of cos Œ±. So, moving everything to one side: 2 cos¬≤ Œ± + 3 cos Œ± - 2 = 0. Okay, so now I have a quadratic equation: 2 cos¬≤ Œ± + 3 cos Œ± - 2 = 0. Let me let u = cos Œ± to make it simpler. Then the equation becomes 2u¬≤ + 3u - 2 = 0. I can solve this quadratic using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is u = [-b ¬± sqrt(b¬≤ - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 2, b = 3, c = -2. Plugging those in, I get u = [-3 ¬± sqrt(9 + 16)] / 4. Because b¬≤ - 4ac is 9 - 4*2*(-2) which is 9 + 16 = 25. So sqrt(25) is 5. Therefore, u = [-3 ¬± 5]/4.So that gives me two solutions: u = (-3 + 5)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2, and u = (-3 - 5)/4 = -8/4 = -2. But cos Œ± can't be -2 because the range of cosine is between -1 and 1. So the only valid solution is u = 1/2. Therefore, cos Œ± = 1/2.Now, I need to find Œ± in the interval (0, œÄ) where cos Œ± = 1/2. I remember that cos œÄ/3 is 1/2, and that's in the first quadrant. Also, cos(5œÄ/3) is 1/2, but 5œÄ/3 is in the fourth quadrant, which is outside our interval since Œ± is between 0 and œÄ. So the only solution is Œ± = œÄ/3. Okay, so that's part (1) done.Moving on to part (2). I need to find the range of the function f(x) = 4 cos x cos(x - Œ±) on the interval [0, œÄ/4]. Since we found Œ± = œÄ/3, let's substitute that in. So f(x) = 4 cos x cos(x - œÄ/3). Hmm, maybe I can use a trigonometric identity to simplify this expression.I recall that cos A cos B can be expressed as [cos(A + B) + cos(A - B)] / 2. Let me try that. So, 4 cos x cos(x - œÄ/3) becomes 4 * [cos(x + (x - œÄ/3)) + cos(x - (x - œÄ/3))]/2. Simplifying inside the cosines: x + x - œÄ/3 is 2x - œÄ/3, and x - x + œÄ/3 is œÄ/3. So, the expression becomes 4 * [cos(2x - œÄ/3) + cos(œÄ/3)] / 2.Simplifying further, 4 divided by 2 is 2, so we have 2[cos(2x - œÄ/3) + cos(œÄ/3)]. I know that cos(œÄ/3) is 1/2, so this becomes 2[cos(2x - œÄ/3) + 1/2]. Distributing the 2, we get 2 cos(2x - œÄ/3) + 1.So, f(x) simplifies to 2 cos(2x - œÄ/3) + 1. Now, I need to find the range of this function on the interval [0, œÄ/4]. Let's analyze the expression 2 cos(2x - œÄ/3) + 1.First, let's consider the argument of the cosine function: 2x - œÄ/3. When x is in [0, œÄ/4], 2x is in [0, œÄ/2], so 2x - œÄ/3 is in [-œÄ/3, œÄ/2 - œÄ/3] which is [-œÄ/3, œÄ/6]. So the angle inside the cosine function varies from -œÄ/3 to œÄ/6.Now, let's think about the cosine function over this interval. Cosine is an even function, so cos(-Œ∏) = cos Œ∏. So, cos(-œÄ/3) is cos(œÄ/3) which is 1/2. Cos(œÄ/6) is sqrt(3)/2. So, the cosine function increases from 1/2 to sqrt(3)/2 as the angle goes from -œÄ/3 to œÄ/6.Therefore, cos(2x - œÄ/3) ranges from 1/2 to sqrt(3)/2 on the interval x ‚àà [0, œÄ/4]. Multiplying this by 2, we get 2 cos(2x - œÄ/3) ranging from 1 to sqrt(3). Then, adding 1, the entire function f(x) ranges from 1 + 1 = 2 to 1 + sqrt(3). Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right because sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 1 + sqrt(3) is about 2.732, but I thought earlier that the maximum might be 3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me double-check. The maximum value of cos(2x - œÄ/3) is sqrt(3)/2, so 2*(sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3). Then, adding 1 gives 1 + sqrt(3). But wait, when x is 0, let's compute f(0). f(0) = 4 cos 0 cos(-œÄ/3) = 4*1*(1/2) = 2. When x is œÄ/4, f(œÄ/4) = 4 cos(œÄ/4) cos(œÄ/4 - œÄ/3). Let's compute that. Cos(œÄ/4) is sqrt(2)/2, and œÄ/4 - œÄ/3 is -œÄ/12. Cos(-œÄ/12) is cos(œÄ/12) which is sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4. So, 4*(sqrt(2)/2)*(sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4. Simplifying, 4 cancels with 4, so we have (sqrt(2)/2)*(sqrt(6) + sqrt(2)). Multiplying out, sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) is sqrt(12) which is 2*sqrt(3), and sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2. So, (2 sqrt(3) + 2)/2 = sqrt(3) + 1. So f(œÄ/4) is sqrt(3) + 1, which is approximately 2.732.But wait, earlier when I thought about the range, I thought the maximum might be 3, but actually, it's sqrt(3) + 1. So, the function f(x) ranges from 2 to sqrt(3) + 1 on [0, œÄ/4]. Hmm, but let me check another point. What about when 2x - œÄ/3 is 0? That occurs when x = œÄ/6. So, at x = œÄ/6, f(x) = 2 cos(0) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3. Oh, so I missed that point earlier. So, actually, the maximum value is 3, and the minimum is 2.Wait, so when x = œÄ/6, which is within [0, œÄ/4]? Wait, œÄ/6 is approximately 0.523, and œÄ/4 is approximately 0.785, so yes, œÄ/6 is within [0, œÄ/4]. So, at x = œÄ/6, f(x) = 3, which is higher than sqrt(3) + 1. So, my earlier conclusion was incorrect because I didn't consider that the maximum of the cosine function occurs at 0, which is within the interval of the argument.So, let's correct that. The argument 2x - œÄ/3 ranges from -œÄ/3 to œÄ/6. The maximum value of cos(theta) occurs at theta = 0, which is within this interval. So, cos(theta) reaches its maximum of 1 at theta = 0, which corresponds to x = œÄ/6. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is 2*1 + 1 = 3. The minimum value occurs at the endpoints. Let's compute f(0) and f(œÄ/4).At x = 0: f(0) = 4 cos 0 cos(-œÄ/3) = 4*1*(1/2) = 2.At x = œÄ/4: f(œÄ/4) = 4 cos(œÄ/4) cos(œÄ/4 - œÄ/3) = 4*(sqrt(2)/2)*cos(-œÄ/12) = 4*(sqrt(2)/2)*(sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4. Simplifying, 4 cancels with 4, so we have (sqrt(2)/2)*(sqrt(6) + sqrt(2)). Multiplying out, sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) is sqrt(12) = 2 sqrt(3), and sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2. So, (2 sqrt(3) + 2)/2 = sqrt(3) + 1 ‚âà 2.732.Wait, but earlier I thought the minimum was 2, which occurs at x = 0, and the maximum is 3 at x = œÄ/6. So, the range of f(x) on [0, œÄ/4] is [2, 3]. That makes sense because at x = 0, f(x) is 2, and at x = œÄ/6, it's 3, and then it decreases again to about 2.732 at x = œÄ/4.So, to summarize, after simplifying f(x) to 2 cos(2x - œÄ/3) + 1, we analyze the interval of the argument 2x - œÄ/3, find that the maximum value of the cosine function is 1, leading to f(x) = 3, and the minimum value is at the endpoint x = 0, giving f(x) = 2. Therefore, the range of f(x) on [0, œÄ/4] is [2, 3].I think that's it. I had to correct myself when I realized that the maximum occurs at x = œÄ/6 within the interval, so the range isn't just up to sqrt(3) + 1 but actually reaches 3."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=(1-x)e^{x}-1.- (I) Find the maximum value of the function f(x);- (II) Let g(x)= frac {f(x)}{x}, where x > -1 and xneq 0, prove that: g(x) < 1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = (1 - x)e^x - 1. I need to find its maximum value and then prove something about another function g(x) which is f(x) divided by x. Let me start with part (I).First, to find the maximum value of f(x), I remember that I need to take the derivative of f(x) and find its critical points. Critical points occur where the derivative is zero or undefined. Since f(x) is a combination of polynomials and exponentials, its derivative should be straightforward.So, let's compute f'(x). The function f(x) is (1 - x)e^x - 1. To differentiate this, I'll use the product rule on the first term. The product rule says that the derivative of u*v is u'v + uv'. Here, u = (1 - x) and v = e^x.Calculating u', the derivative of (1 - x) with respect to x is -1. The derivative of v = e^x is still e^x. So, applying the product rule:f'(x) = u'v + uv' = (-1)e^x + (1 - x)e^x.Simplify that:f'(x) = -e^x + (1 - x)e^x.Factor out e^x:f'(x) = e^x(-1 + 1 - x) = e^x(-x).So, f'(x) = -x e^x.Alright, so the derivative is -x e^x. Now, to find critical points, set f'(x) = 0:- x e^x = 0.Since e^x is never zero for any real x, the only solution is x = 0.So, x = 0 is the critical point. Now, I need to determine whether this critical point is a maximum or a minimum. I can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign of f'(x) around x = 0.Let me try the sign analysis.For x < 0, say x = -1:f'(-1) = -(-1)e^{-1} = (1)e^{-1} ‚âà 0.3679, which is positive.For x > 0, say x = 1:f'(1) = -(1)e^{1} = -e ‚âà -2.718, which is negative.So, f'(x) changes from positive to negative as x increases through 0. That means the function f(x) is increasing before x = 0 and decreasing after x = 0. Therefore, x = 0 is a local maximum.Since the function tends to negative infinity as x approaches positive infinity (because e^x dominates and (1 - x) becomes negative) and as x approaches negative infinity, (1 - x) becomes positive and e^x approaches zero, so f(x) approaches -1. Therefore, the maximum value occurs at x = 0.Calculating f(0):f(0) = (1 - 0)e^0 - 1 = 1*1 - 1 = 0.So, the maximum value of f(x) is 0.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check.If I plug in x = 0, yes, it gives 0. For x approaching positive infinity, (1 - x)e^x goes to negative infinity, so f(x) tends to negative infinity. For x approaching negative infinity, (1 - x) becomes positive infinity, but e^x approaches zero, so the product (1 - x)e^x approaches zero, and f(x) approaches -1. So, indeed, the maximum is at x = 0 with f(0) = 0.Alright, part (I) seems done. Now, moving on to part (II).We have g(x) = f(x)/x, where x > -1 and x ‚â† 0. We need to prove that g(x) < 1.First, let's write down g(x):g(x) = [(1 - x)e^x - 1]/x.We need to show that this is less than 1 for all x > -1, x ‚â† 0.Let me consider two cases: x > 0 and -1 < x < 0.Case 1: x > 0.From part (I), we know that f(x) has a maximum at x = 0, which is 0. For x > 0, since f(x) is decreasing, f(x) < f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(x) is negative when x > 0.So, g(x) = f(x)/x. Since x > 0 and f(x) < 0, g(x) is negative. Therefore, g(x) < 0 < 1. So, for x > 0, g(x) < 1 is automatically true.Case 2: -1 < x < 0.Here, x is negative. So, f(x) is divided by a negative number. Let's see what f(x) is in this interval.From part (I), f(x) is increasing on (-‚àû, 0). Since at x = 0, f(0) = 0, and as x approaches -1 from the right, let's see what happens.Compute f(-1):f(-1) = (1 - (-1))e^{-1} - 1 = (2)e^{-1} - 1 ‚âà 2*0.3679 - 1 ‚âà 0.7358 - 1 ‚âà -0.2642.Wait, so at x = -1, f(-1) ‚âà -0.2642, which is negative. But as x approaches 0 from the left, f(x) approaches 0.So, f(x) is increasing from f(-1) ‚âà -0.2642 to f(0) = 0. So, in (-1, 0), f(x) is negative and increasing.Therefore, when x is in (-1, 0), f(x) is negative, and x is negative. So, f(x)/x is positive because negative divided by negative is positive.So, g(x) is positive in this interval. We need to show that g(x) < 1.So, let's write the inequality:g(x) < 1=> f(x)/x < 1Since x is negative, multiplying both sides by x (which is negative) reverses the inequality:f(x) > x.So, we need to show that f(x) > x for -1 < x < 0.Let me define h(x) = f(x) - x. Then, h(x) = (1 - x)e^x - 1 - x.We need to show that h(x) > 0 for -1 < x < 0.So, let's compute h(x):h(x) = (1 - x)e^x - 1 - x.Let me compute h(0):h(0) = (1 - 0)e^0 - 1 - 0 = 1 - 1 = 0.Compute h(-1):h(-1) = (1 - (-1))e^{-1} - 1 - (-1) = (2)e^{-1} - 1 + 1 = 2/e ‚âà 0.7358.So, h(-1) ‚âà 0.7358 > 0.We need to see if h(x) is always positive in (-1, 0). Let's compute the derivative h'(x) to analyze the behavior.Compute h'(x):h'(x) = derivative of (1 - x)e^x - 1 - x.We already know the derivative of (1 - x)e^x is f'(x) = -x e^x.So, h'(x) = f'(x) - derivative of 1 - x.Derivative of 1 is 0, derivative of -x is -1.So, h'(x) = -x e^x - 1.So, h'(x) = -x e^x - 1.Now, let's analyze h'(x) in the interval (-1, 0).Since x is in (-1, 0), -x is in (0, 1). So, 0 < -x < 1.Also, e^x is in (e^{-1}, 1), since x is between -1 and 0.So, e^x is between approximately 0.3679 and 1.Therefore, -x e^x is between 0 and 1, because:0 < -x < 1,0.3679 < e^x < 1,So, multiplying these:0 < (-x)e^x < 1.Therefore, -x e^x is positive and less than 1.So, h'(x) = -x e^x - 1.Since -x e^x is positive, subtracting 1 gives h'(x) < 0.Therefore, h'(x) is negative in (-1, 0). That means h(x) is decreasing in (-1, 0).We know that h(0) = 0 and h(-1) ‚âà 0.7358.Since h(x) is decreasing, moving from x = -1 to x = 0, h(x) decreases from approximately 0.7358 to 0.Therefore, for all x in (-1, 0), h(x) > h(0) = 0.Wait, no. If h(x) is decreasing, then as x increases, h(x) decreases. So, at x = -1, h(-1) ‚âà 0.7358, and as x approaches 0, h(x) approaches 0.So, for all x in (-1, 0), h(x) is greater than 0 because it starts at 0.7358 and decreases to 0. So, h(x) > 0 in (-1, 0).Therefore, f(x) - x > 0 => f(x) > x in (-1, 0).Which implies, since x is negative, f(x)/x < 1.Hence, for -1 < x < 0, g(x) = f(x)/x < 1.Therefore, combining both cases:- For x > 0, g(x) < 0 < 1.- For -1 < x < 0, g(x) < 1.Thus, for all x > -1, x ‚â† 0, g(x) < 1.So, that completes the proof.Wait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.For x > 0, f(x) is negative, so g(x) is negative, which is less than 1.For -1 < x < 0, f(x) is negative but x is also negative, so g(x) is positive. To show g(x) < 1, we transformed the inequality to f(x) > x, which we proved by defining h(x) = f(x) - x, showing h(x) is positive in (-1, 0) by analyzing its derivative.Yes, that seems solid. I think that's correct.**Final Answer**- (I) The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is (boxed{0}).- (II) It is proven that ( g(x) < 1 )."},{"question":"All plane angles of a trihedral angle are right angles. Prove that any cross-section of it, not passing through the vertex, is an acute-angled triangle.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a trihedral angle where all the plane angles are right angles. I need to prove that any cross-section of it, not passing through the vertex, is an acute-angled triangle. Hmm, let me try to visualize this first.A trihedral angle is like the corner of a cube where three edges meet at right angles. So, if I imagine a cube, the corner where three edges meet is a trihedral angle with all plane angles being 90 degrees. Now, if I take a cross-section of this trihedral angle, not passing through the vertex, what does that look like?A cross-section would be a plane cutting through the edges of the trihedral angle. Since it's not passing through the vertex, the plane will intersect each of the three edges at some point away from the corner. So, the cross-section should be a triangle formed by connecting these three intersection points.Let me denote the vertex of the trihedral angle as point O. The three edges meeting at O can be thought of as the x, y, and z-axes in a 3D coordinate system. So, any point on the x-axis can be represented as (a, 0, 0), on the y-axis as (0, b, 0), and on the z-axis as (0, 0, c), where a, b, c are positive real numbers.If I take a plane that intersects these three axes at points A, B, and C respectively, then the cross-section triangle will be triangle ABC with vertices at A(a, 0, 0), B(0, b, 0), and C(0, 0, c). Now, I need to show that all the angles in triangle ABC are acute, meaning each angle is less than 90 degrees.To find the angles of triangle ABC, I can use the dot product formula. The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. If the dot product is positive, the angle is acute; if it's zero, the angle is right; and if it's negative, the angle is obtuse.First, let me find the vectors representing the sides of the triangle. The vectors from point A to B, from B to C, and from C to A can be calculated as follows:- Vector AB = B - A = (0 - a, b - 0, 0 - 0) = (-a, b, 0)- Vector BC = C - B = (0 - 0, 0 - b, c - 0) = (0, -b, c)- Vector CA = A - C = (a - 0, 0 - 0, 0 - c) = (a, 0, -c)Now, let's compute the dot products between these vectors to find the angles.First, let's find angle at point A, which is angle BAC. The vectors forming this angle are AB and AC. Wait, actually, in triangle ABC, the angle at A is between vectors AB and AC. But in my earlier step, I have vectors AB, BC, and CA. Maybe I need to adjust that.Actually, in triangle ABC, the angle at A is between vectors AB and AC. So, vector AB is from A to B, which is (-a, b, 0), and vector AC is from A to C, which is (-a, 0, c). So, let me correct that.Vector AB = (-a, b, 0)Vector AC = (-a, 0, c)Now, the dot product of AB and AC is:AB ¬∑ AC = (-a)(-a) + (b)(0) + (0)(c) = a¬≤ + 0 + 0 = a¬≤The magnitude of AB is sqrt((-a)¬≤ + b¬≤ + 0¬≤) = sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤)The magnitude of AC is sqrt((-a)¬≤ + 0¬≤ + c¬≤) = sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤)So, the cosine of angle BAC is:cos(angle BAC) = (AB ¬∑ AC) / (|AB| |AC|) = a¬≤ / (sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) * sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤))Since a, b, c are positive, the denominator is positive, and the numerator is positive. Therefore, cos(angle BAC) is positive, which means angle BAC is acute (less than 90 degrees).Similarly, I can compute the other angles.Let's find angle at point B, which is angle ABC. The vectors forming this angle are BA and BC.Vector BA = A - B = (a, -b, 0)Vector BC = (0, -b, c)Dot product BA ¬∑ BC = (a)(0) + (-b)(-b) + (0)(c) = 0 + b¬≤ + 0 = b¬≤Magnitude of BA is sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤)Magnitude of BC is sqrt(0¬≤ + b¬≤ + c¬≤) = sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤)So, cos(angle ABC) = b¬≤ / (sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) * sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤)) which is positive, so angle ABC is acute.Finally, angle at point C, angle BCA. The vectors forming this angle are CB and CA.Vector CB = B - C = (0, b, -c)Vector CA = (a, 0, -c)Dot product CB ¬∑ CA = (0)(a) + (b)(0) + (-c)(-c) = 0 + 0 + c¬≤ = c¬≤Magnitude of CB is sqrt(0¬≤ + b¬≤ + c¬≤) = sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤)Magnitude of CA is sqrt(a¬≤ + 0¬≤ + c¬≤) = sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤)So, cos(angle BCA) = c¬≤ / (sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤) * sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤)) which is positive, so angle BCA is acute.Therefore, all three angles in triangle ABC are acute, meaning the cross-section is an acute-angled triangle.Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the vectors. Let me double-check.When computing angle at A, I used vectors AB and AC, which is correct. Similarly, for angle at B, vectors BA and BC, and for angle at C, vectors CB and CA. The dot products all resulted in positive values, leading to acute angles. So, it seems correct.Alternatively, another approach could be using the law of cosines. Let me try that as a verification.In triangle ABC, the sides are:AB = sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤)AC = sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤)BC = sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤)Using the law of cosines for angle at A:cos(angle BAC) = (AB¬≤ + AC¬≤ - BC¬≤) / (2 * AB * AC)Plugging in the values:AB¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤AC¬≤ = a¬≤ + c¬≤BC¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤So,cos(angle BAC) = ( (a¬≤ + b¬≤) + (a¬≤ + c¬≤) - (b¬≤ + c¬≤) ) / (2 * sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) * sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤))= (2a¬≤) / (2 * sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) * sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤))= a¬≤ / (sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) * sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤))Which is the same as before, so it's positive, hence acute.Similarly, for angle at B:cos(angle ABC) = (AB¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AC¬≤) / (2 * AB * BC)= ( (a¬≤ + b¬≤) + (b¬≤ + c¬≤) - (a¬≤ + c¬≤) ) / (2 * sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) * sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤))= (2b¬≤) / (2 * sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) * sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤))= b¬≤ / (sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤) * sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤)) > 0And for angle at C:cos(angle BCA) = (AC¬≤ + BC¬≤ - AB¬≤) / (2 * AC * BC)= ( (a¬≤ + c¬≤) + (b¬≤ + c¬≤) - (a¬≤ + b¬≤) ) / (2 * sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤) * sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤))= (2c¬≤) / (2 * sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤) * sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤))= c¬≤ / (sqrt(a¬≤ + c¬≤) * sqrt(b¬≤ + c¬≤)) > 0All cosines are positive, so all angles are acute. Therefore, the cross-section is indeed an acute-angled triangle.I think this makes sense. Since all the dot products are positive, the angles must be acute. Also, using the law of cosines confirms this result. So, regardless of the distances a, b, c from the vertex, as long as they are positive, the cross-section triangle will always have all angles less than 90 degrees.Another way to think about it is that in 3D space, the trihedral angle with all right angles imposes a kind of orthogonality on the edges. When you cut through it with a plane not passing through the vertex, the resulting triangle can't have any right or obtuse angles because the original edges are orthogonal, and the distances from the vertex ensure that the sides of the triangle are combinations of these orthogonal vectors, leading to acute angles.I wonder if there's a more geometric way to see this without coordinates. Maybe by considering projections or something. But the algebraic approach using dot products and law of cosines seems solid.Let me also consider specific examples. Suppose a = b = c = 1. Then the triangle ABC would have sides sqrt(2), sqrt(2), sqrt(2), forming an equilateral triangle, which is certainly acute. If a, b, c are different, say a=1, b=2, c=3, then the sides would be sqrt(1+4)=sqrt(5), sqrt(1+9)=sqrt(10), and sqrt(4+9)=sqrt(13). Calculating the angles using the law of cosines should still give all angles less than 90 degrees.For instance, angle at A:cos(angle BAC) = (sqrt(5)^2 + sqrt(10)^2 - sqrt(13)^2) / (2 * sqrt(5) * sqrt(10))= (5 + 10 - 13) / (2 * sqrt(50))= (2) / (2 * 5 * sqrt(2))= 1 / (5 * sqrt(2)) ‚âà 0.1414 > 0So, angle BAC ‚âà arccos(0.1414) ‚âà 81.9 degrees, which is acute.Similarly, other angles would also be acute. So, specific examples support the general proof.I think I've covered all bases here. Both the vector approach and the law of cosines lead to the conclusion that all angles are acute. Therefore, any cross-section of a trihedral angle with all right plane angles, not passing through the vertex, must form an acute-angled triangle."},{"question":"At a middle school, the students in sixth grade, seventh grade, and eighth grade run an average of 14, 18, and 12 minutes per day, respectively.

On a specific sports day in a week, each student runs an additional 4 minutes. What is the average number of minutes run per day by these students considering the sports day occurs once a week?textbf{(A)} 15.6 qquad textbf{(B)} 16.5 qquad textbf{(C)} 17.2 qquad textbf{(D)} 14.5 qquad textbf{(E)} 18.3","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about students in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades running an average of 14, 18, and 12 minutes per day, respectively. The problem also mentions that there are three times as many sixth graders as seventh graders, and four times as many seventh graders as eighth graders. Additionally, on a specific sports day once a week, each student runs an extra 4 minutes. I need to find the average number of minutes run per day by these students considering the sports day.Alright, let me try to break this down step by step. First, I think I need to figure out the number of students in each grade. The problem says there are three times as many sixth graders as seventh graders, and four times as many seventh graders as eighth graders. So, maybe I can express the number of students in each grade in terms of the number of eighth graders.Let me denote the number of eighth graders as E. Then, since there are four times as many seventh graders as eighth graders, the number of seventh graders would be 4E. Similarly, since there are three times as many sixth graders as seventh graders, the number of sixth graders would be 3 times 4E, which is 12E. So, in summary:- Number of eighth graders: E- Number of seventh graders: 4E- Number of sixth graders: 12EAlright, that seems manageable. Now, the next part is about the average running times. Sixth graders run 14 minutes per day, seventh graders run 18 minutes, and eighth graders run 12 minutes. So, I can calculate the total running time for each grade by multiplying the number of students by their respective average running times.Let me write that out:- Total running time for sixth graders: 12E * 14- Total running time for seventh graders: 4E * 18- Total running time for eighth graders: E * 12Calculating each of these:- 12E * 14 = 168E- 4E * 18 = 72E- E * 12 = 12ESo, the total running time for all students on a regular day is 168E + 72E + 12E = 252E minutes.But wait, there's also the sports day once a week where each student runs an additional 4 minutes. Hmm, so I need to account for that extra running time. Since the sports day occurs once a week, I think I need to spread that extra running time over the days of the week to find the average per day.Assuming a week has 5 school days, the extra 4 minutes on sports day would add an average of 4/5 minutes per day. So, each student effectively runs 4/5 minutes more each day on average because of the sports day.Therefore, the adjusted average running time per day for each grade would be:- Sixth graders: 14 + 4/5- Seventh graders: 18 + 4/5- Eighth graders: 12 + 4/5Let me compute these:- 14 + 4/5 = 14.8 minutes- 18 + 4/5 = 18.8 minutes- 12 + 4/5 = 12.8 minutesNow, I can calculate the total running time with this adjustment:- Total for sixth graders: 12E * 14.8- Total for seventh graders: 4E * 18.8- Total for eighth graders: E * 12.8Calculating each:- 12E * 14.8 = 177.6E- 4E * 18.8 = 75.2E- E * 12.8 = 12.8EAdding these up: 177.6E + 75.2E + 12.8E = 265.6E minutes.Now, to find the average number of minutes run per day by all the students, I need to divide the total running time by the total number of students.The total number of students is 12E + 4E + E = 17E.So, the average running time per student per day is 265.6E / 17E. The E cancels out, so it's 265.6 / 17.Let me compute that: 265.6 divided by 17.17 goes into 265.6 how many times? Let's see:17 * 15 = 255265.6 - 255 = 10.617 goes into 10.6 approximately 0.6235 times.So, 15 + 0.6235 = 15.6235.Rounding that to one decimal place, it's approximately 15.6 minutes.Looking at the answer choices, option A is 15.6, so that must be the answer.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, the number of students:- Eighth graders: E- Seventh graders: 4E- Sixth graders: 12ETotal students: 17E. That seems correct.Regular running times:- 12E * 14 = 168E- 4E * 18 = 72E- E * 12 = 12ETotal: 252ESports day adds 4 minutes once a week, so per day average addition is 4/5 = 0.8 minutes.Adjusted running times:- 14 + 0.8 = 14.8- 18 + 0.8 = 18.8- 12 + 0.8 = 12.8Total adjusted running times:- 12E * 14.8 = 177.6E- 4E * 18.8 = 75.2E- E * 12.8 = 12.8ETotal: 265.6EAverage: 265.6E / 17E = 15.6235, which is approximately 15.6.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 15.6, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"George has 5 boxes of eggs. Each box holds a certain number of eggs and there are 9 boxes in a case.

The options are A: ‚àö5, B: ‚àö(1/2), C: ‚àö8, and D: ‚àö(a¬≤). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First off, I remember that a square root is considered simplest when it doesn't have any perfect square factors inside the radical. Also, if there's a fraction under the square root, it's better to rationalize the denominator to make it simpler. And for variables, like in option D, I think we can simplify that too.Starting with option A: ‚àö5. Well, 5 is a prime number, right? So it doesn't have any factors other than 1 and itself. That means there's no perfect square factor to take out of the square root. So, ‚àö5 is already in its simplest form. That seems straightforward.Moving on to option B: ‚àö(1/2). This one is a fraction under the square root. I think I need to rationalize the denominator here. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by ‚àö2, which is the square root of the denominator. So, ‚àö(1/2) becomes (‚àö1 * ‚àö2) / (‚àö2 * ‚àö2). Simplifying that, ‚àö1 is 1, and ‚àö2 times ‚àö2 is 2. So, it becomes ‚àö2 / 2. That looks simpler than ‚àö(1/2), so option B isn't in its simplest form as it is.Next up is option C: ‚àö8. Okay, 8 isn't a prime number, so let's see if it has any perfect square factors. The perfect squares less than 8 are 1, 4, and 9. Well, 4 is a factor of 8 because 4 times 2 is 8. So, I can rewrite ‚àö8 as ‚àö(4*2). Then, using the property that ‚àö(a*b) = ‚àöa * ‚àöb, this becomes ‚àö4 * ‚àö2. ‚àö4 is 2, so it simplifies to 2‚àö2. That's definitely simpler than ‚àö8, so option C isn't in its simplest form either.Finally, option D: ‚àö(a¬≤). Hmm, this one involves a variable. I recall that the square root of something squared is the absolute value of that something. So, ‚àö(a¬≤) simplifies to |a|. But in the context of square roots, especially when dealing with variables, sometimes we assume that the variable represents a non-negative number, so it might just simplify to a. Either way, it's simpler than having the square root of a squared term. So, option D isn't in its simplest form as it is.Putting it all together, option A: ‚àö5 is already in its simplest form because 5 is a prime number with no perfect square factors. Options B, C, and D can all be simplified further, so they aren't the simplest square roots among the choices.I think I've covered all the options and simplified them as much as possible. It seems pretty clear that option A is the simplest square root here."},{"question":"If r is positive and the line whose equation is x + y = r + 1 is tangent to the circle whose equation is x^2 + y^2 = r^2, then find the value of r.A) 1 + sqrt{2}B) 1C) 2D) sqrt{2}E) 2sqrt{2}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of r. The problem says that if r is positive and the line whose equation is x + y = r + 1 is tangent to the circle whose equation is x¬≤ + y¬≤ = r¬≤, then find the value of r. The options are given as A) 1 + ‚àö2, B) 1, C) 2, D) ‚àö2, E) 2‚àö2.Hmm, let me try to visualize this. There's a circle centered at the origin with radius r, and a line x + y = r + 1. The line is tangent to the circle, which means it touches the circle at exactly one point. So, the distance from the center of the circle to the line should be equal to the radius of the circle.I remember that the distance from a point (x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is given by |ax‚ÇÄ + by‚ÇÄ + c| / ‚àö(a¬≤ + b¬≤). In this case, the center of the circle is (0, 0), and the line is x + y = r + 1. I need to write the line equation in the standard form ax + by + c = 0. So, subtracting r + 1 from both sides, the equation becomes x + y - (r + 1) = 0.Now, applying the distance formula, the distance from (0, 0) to the line x + y - (r + 1) = 0 is |0 + 0 - (r + 1)| / ‚àö(1¬≤ + 1¬≤) = | - (r + 1)| / ‚àö2. Since r is positive, r + 1 is positive, so the absolute value just becomes (r + 1)/‚àö2.Since the line is tangent to the circle, this distance should be equal to the radius of the circle, which is r. So, we have the equation:(r + 1)/‚àö2 = rTo solve for r, I can multiply both sides by ‚àö2 to get rid of the denominator:r + 1 = r‚àö2Now, I need to isolate r. Let me subtract r from both sides:1 = r‚àö2 - rFactor out r on the right side:1 = r(‚àö2 - 1)Now, solve for r by dividing both sides by (‚àö2 - 1):r = 1 / (‚àö2 - 1)Hmm, this fraction has a radical in the denominator. I think I need to rationalize the denominator. To do that, I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (‚àö2 + 1):r = [1 * (‚àö2 + 1)] / [(‚àö2 - 1)(‚àö2 + 1)]Multiplying out the denominator:(‚àö2 - 1)(‚àö2 + 1) = (‚àö2)¬≤ - (1)¬≤ = 2 - 1 = 1So, the denominator simplifies to 1, and the numerator is ‚àö2 + 1. Therefore:r = ‚àö2 + 1Looking back at the options, A is 1 + ‚àö2, which is the same as ‚àö2 + 1. So, the answer should be A.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the distance formula, I had (r + 1)/‚àö2 = r. Multiplying both sides by ‚àö2 gives r + 1 = r‚àö2. Then, subtracting r: 1 = r‚àö2 - r, which is 1 = r(‚àö2 - 1). Dividing both sides by (‚àö2 - 1) gives r = 1/(‚àö2 - 1). Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by (‚àö2 + 1), resulting in (‚àö2 + 1)/1, so r = ‚àö2 + 1. Yep, that seems correct.I think I got it right. So, the value of r is 1 + ‚àö2, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"A certain manufacturer produces and sells a certain liquid material in spherical bottles. The manufacturing cost of the bottle is 0.1pi r^{4} cents, where r (unit: cm) is the radius of the bottle. It is known that for every 1mL of liquid material sold, the manufacturer can make a profit of 0.3 cents, and the maximum radius of the bottle that the manufacturer can produce is 8cm. Therefore, when the profit per bottle of liquid material is maximized, the radius of the bottle is ( )A: 3cmB: 4cmC: 5cmD: 6cm","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a manufacturer who makes and sells liquid material in spherical bottles. The goal is to figure out the radius of the bottle that maximizes the profit per bottle. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I need to understand the given information. The manufacturing cost of the bottle is given as 0.1œÄr‚Å¥ cents, where r is the radius in centimeters. That seems like a pretty specific cost function. Also, for every 1 mL of liquid sold, the manufacturer makes a profit of 0.3 cents. The maximum radius they can produce is 8 cm. So, we need to find the radius that will maximize the profit per bottle.Okay, so profit is generally revenue minus cost. In this case, the revenue comes from selling the liquid, and the cost is the manufacturing cost of the bottle. So, I need to express both the revenue and the cost in terms of the radius r.Let's start with the revenue. The revenue depends on the volume of the liquid in the bottle because for every mL sold, they make 0.3 cents. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)œÄr¬≥. Since 1 mL is equivalent to 1 cm¬≥, the volume in mL is the same as the volume in cm¬≥. So, the revenue from selling the liquid would be 0.3 cents multiplied by the volume in mL, which is 0.3 * (4/3)œÄr¬≥ cents.Now, the cost is given as 0.1œÄr‚Å¥ cents. So, the profit per bottle would be the revenue minus the cost. Let me write that out:Profit = Revenue - CostProfit = 0.3 * (4/3)œÄr¬≥ - 0.1œÄr‚Å¥Let me simplify that expression. First, 0.3 multiplied by (4/3) is 0.4. So, the revenue part simplifies to 0.4œÄr¬≥. Then, the cost is 0.1œÄr‚Å¥. So, the profit function becomes:Profit = 0.4œÄr¬≥ - 0.1œÄr‚Å¥I can factor out 0.1œÄ from both terms to make it simpler:Profit = 0.1œÄ(4r¬≥ - r‚Å¥)Okay, so now I have the profit function in terms of r. To find the maximum profit, I need to find the value of r that maximizes this function. Since this is a calculus problem, I should take the derivative of the profit function with respect to r and set it equal to zero to find the critical points.Let's compute the derivative of the profit function. The profit function is:f(r) = 0.1œÄ(4r¬≥ - r‚Å¥)Taking the derivative with respect to r:f'(r) = 0.1œÄ * d/dr (4r¬≥ - r‚Å¥)f'(r) = 0.1œÄ (12r¬≤ - 4r¬≥)f'(r) = 0.1œÄ * 4r¬≤(3 - r)f'(r) = 0.4œÄr¬≤(3 - r)Okay, so the derivative simplifies to 0.4œÄr¬≤(3 - r). To find the critical points, set f'(r) = 0:0.4œÄr¬≤(3 - r) = 0Since 0.4œÄ is a positive constant, we can ignore it for the purposes of solving for r. So, we have:r¬≤(3 - r) = 0This equation will be zero when either r¬≤ = 0 or (3 - r) = 0. Solving these:1. r¬≤ = 0 ‚áí r = 02. 3 - r = 0 ‚áí r = 3So, the critical points are at r = 0 and r = 3. Since r = 0 doesn't make sense in this context (a bottle with radius 0 has no volume and no profit), we can disregard that. Therefore, the critical point we're interested in is r = 3 cm.Now, to ensure that this critical point is indeed a maximum, we can perform the second derivative test or analyze the sign of the first derivative around r = 3.Let's try the second derivative test. First, compute the second derivative of the profit function.We have the first derivative:f'(r) = 0.4œÄr¬≤(3 - r)Let's find f''(r):f''(r) = d/dr [0.4œÄr¬≤(3 - r)]= 0.4œÄ [d/dr (r¬≤(3 - r))]= 0.4œÄ [2r(3 - r) + r¬≤(-1)]= 0.4œÄ [6r - 2r¬≤ - r¬≤]= 0.4œÄ [6r - 3r¬≤]= 0.4œÄ * 3r(2 - r)= 1.2œÄr(2 - r)Now, evaluate f''(r) at r = 3:f''(3) = 1.2œÄ * 3 * (2 - 3)= 1.2œÄ * 3 * (-1)= -3.6œÄSince f''(3) is negative, this indicates that the function is concave down at r = 3, which means that r = 3 is indeed a local maximum.Alternatively, we could analyze the sign of the first derivative around r = 3. For values of r less than 3, say r = 2:f'(2) = 0.4œÄ * 4 * (3 - 2) = 0.4œÄ * 4 * 1 = 1.6œÄ > 0So, the function is increasing before r = 3.For values of r greater than 3, say r = 4:f'(4) = 0.4œÄ * 16 * (3 - 4) = 0.4œÄ * 16 * (-1) = -6.4œÄ < 0So, the function is decreasing after r = 3. This confirms that r = 3 is a maximum.Therefore, the radius that maximizes the profit per bottle is 3 cm.Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because the answer choices include 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm. I got 3 cm, which is option A, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Looking back, the profit function was:Profit = 0.1œÄ(4r¬≥ - r‚Å¥)Taking the derivative:f'(r) = 0.1œÄ(12r¬≤ - 4r¬≥) = 0.4œÄr¬≤(3 - r)Setting f'(r) = 0 gives r = 0 or r = 3. Since r = 0 isn't feasible, r = 3 is the critical point. The second derivative test confirmed it's a maximum.So, I think my reasoning is correct. The radius that maximizes profit is 3 cm.But just to be thorough, let me plug in r = 3 into the profit function and see what the profit is, and maybe compare it with r = 4 to ensure it's indeed higher.Compute Profit at r = 3:Profit = 0.1œÄ(4*(3)^3 - (3)^4)= 0.1œÄ(4*27 - 81)= 0.1œÄ(108 - 81)= 0.1œÄ(27)= 2.7œÄ centsCompute Profit at r = 4:Profit = 0.1œÄ(4*(4)^3 - (4)^4)= 0.1œÄ(4*64 - 256)= 0.1œÄ(256 - 256)= 0.1œÄ(0)= 0 centsHmm, interesting. At r = 4, the profit is zero. That makes sense because beyond r = 3, the profit starts decreasing, and at r = 4, it's already down to zero. So, that further confirms that r = 3 is indeed the maximum.Let me also check r = 2 to see the trend:Profit at r = 2:= 0.1œÄ(4*8 - 16)= 0.1œÄ(32 - 16)= 0.1œÄ(16)= 1.6œÄ centsWhich is less than at r = 3. So, the profit increases from r = 0 to r = 3, peaks at r = 3, and then decreases beyond that.Therefore, I'm confident that the radius which maximizes the profit is 3 cm, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"A circle passes through all three vertices of an equilateral triangle that has each side of length 4. What is the area of this circle? Express your answer in terms of pi.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: there's an equilateral triangle with each side of length 4, and a circle passes through all three vertices of this triangle. I need to find the area of this circle and express it in terms of œÄ. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. That symmetry might help me figure out the properties of the circle that passes through all three vertices. I think that circle is called the circumcircle, and its center is the circumcenter of the triangle.Now, I recall that the circumcenter of a triangle is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect. In an equilateral triangle, because of its symmetry, the circumcenter should coincide with the centroid, which is the intersection point of the medians. Also, in an equilateral triangle, the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, meaning the distance from the centroid to a vertex is twice as long as the distance from the centroid to the midpoint of a side.So, to find the radius of the circumcircle, I need to find the length of the circumradius. Let me denote the side length of the triangle as 'a', which is 4 in this case. I think there's a formula for the circumradius (R) of an equilateral triangle, which is R = a / (‚àö3). Wait, is that right? Let me verify.Alternatively, I can derive it using some basic geometry. Let's consider one of the medians of the triangle. Since the triangle is equilateral, all medians are equal. The length of a median can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. If I split the triangle into two right-angled triangles by drawing a median, the base of each right triangle will be half of the side length, so that's 2. The hypotenuse is the side of the original triangle, which is 4, and the other side is the median.So, using Pythagoras: (median)^2 + (2)^2 = (4)^2. Therefore, (median)^2 = 16 - 4 = 12, so the median is ‚àö12, which simplifies to 2‚àö3. Okay, so the length of each median is 2‚àö3.Since the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, the circumradius, which is the distance from the centroid to a vertex, is two-thirds of the median's length. So, R = (2/3) * (2‚àö3) = (4‚àö3)/3. That seems correct.Now, to find the area of the circumcircle, I use the formula for the area of a circle, which is œÄ times the radius squared. So, plugging in R = (4‚àö3)/3, the area becomes œÄ * [(4‚àö3)/3]^2.Let me compute that step by step. First, square the radius: [(4‚àö3)/3]^2 = (4^2)*(‚àö3)^2 / (3^2) = 16*3 / 9 = 48/9 = 16/3. So, the area is œÄ * (16/3) = (16/3)œÄ.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in squaring the radius. (4‚àö3)^2 is indeed 16*3 = 48, and 3^2 is 9, so 48/9 simplifies to 16/3. Yep, that looks right.So, putting it all together, the area of the circle is (16/3)œÄ. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make any errors.1. Recognized the triangle is equilateral with side length 4.2. Remembered that the circumradius of an equilateral triangle can be found using the formula R = a / (‚àö3), but decided to derive it using the median.3. Calculated the length of the median using the Pythagorean theorem, got 2‚àö3.4. Since the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, found the circumradius as (2/3)*median = (4‚àö3)/3.5. Calculated the area of the circle using œÄR¬≤, which gave (16/3)œÄ.Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors, and the logic flows correctly. So, I'm confident that the area of the circle is (16/3)œÄ.**Final Answer**The area of the circle is boxed{dfrac{16}{3}pi}."},{"question":"Let alpha be an irrational number. For every positive integer q, let (N_{q}(alpha)=min left{left|alpha-frac{p}{q}right|: p in mathbb{Z}right}), which is the distance to the nearest fraction with denominator q (not necessarily in reduced form). Show that there exists a k such thatsum_{q=1}^{k} N_{q}(alpha) > 1","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to show that for an irrational number Œ±, there exists some integer k such that the sum of N_q(Œ±) from q=1 to k is greater than 1. N_q(Œ±) is defined as the minimum distance from Œ± to any fraction with denominator q. First, I need to understand what N_q(Œ±) really represents. It's the smallest distance between Œ± and a fraction p/q where p is an integer. Since Œ± is irrational, it can't be expressed as a fraction, so this distance will always be positive. I remember that for any real number Œ≤, the distance to the nearest integer is denoted by ||Œ≤||, which is the minimum of |Œ≤ - n| for all integers n. Maybe I can relate N_q(Œ±) to this concept. If I multiply Œ± by q, I get qŒ±, and then the distance from qŒ± to the nearest integer is ||qŒ±||. So, N_q(Œ±) should be ||qŒ±|| divided by q, right? Because we're scaling back down by dividing by q.So, N_q(Œ±) = ||qŒ±|| / q. That makes sense because if ||qŒ±|| is the distance from qŒ± to the nearest integer, dividing by q gives the distance from Œ± to the nearest fraction p/q.Now, I need to analyze the sum of these N_q(Œ±) from q=1 to k. The goal is to show that this sum can exceed 1 for some k. I think I can approach this by considering pairs of denominators, like 2q and 2q+1. Maybe by looking at these pairs, I can find a lower bound for the sum. Let me consider N_{2q}(Œ±) + N_{2q+1}(Œ±). Using the expression I have for N_q(Œ±), this becomes ||2qŒ±||/(2q) + ||(2q+1)Œ±||/(2q+1). I recall that there's a property of the distance to the nearest integer: ||Œ≤ + Œ≥|| ‚â§ ||Œ≤|| + ||Œ≥||. Maybe I can use this to relate ||2qŒ±|| and ||(2q+1)Œ±||. If I let Œ≤ = 2qŒ± and Œ≥ = Œ±, then ||Œ≤ + Œ≥|| = ||(2q+1)Œ±||. According to the property, this is less than or equal to ||2qŒ±|| + ||Œ±||. But I need a lower bound, not an upper bound. Maybe I can manipulate this inequality to get a lower bound. Suppose that ||2qŒ±|| is less than ||Œ±||/2. Then, using the triangle inequality, ||(2q+1)Œ±|| = ||2qŒ± + Œ±|| ‚â• ||Œ±|| - ||2qŒ±||. If ||2qŒ±|| < ||Œ±||/2, then ||(2q+1)Œ±|| ‚â• ||Œ±|| - ||Œ±||/2 = ||Œ±||/2. So, in this case, either ||2qŒ±|| is at least ||Œ±||/2, or ||(2q+1)Œ±|| is at least ||Œ±||/2. Therefore, for each q, at least one of N_{2q}(Œ±) or N_{2q+1}(Œ±) is at least (||Œ±||/2) divided by either 2q or 2q+1. Since 2q and 2q+1 are both roughly around 2q, I can approximate the denominator as 3q to get a lower bound. So, N_{2q}(Œ±) + N_{2q+1}(Œ±) is at least (||Œ±||/2) / (3q) = ||Œ±||/(6q). If I sum this over q from 1 to some k, I get a sum that behaves like ||Œ±||/6 times the harmonic series. The harmonic series diverges, meaning it grows without bound. Therefore, for a sufficiently large k, the sum will exceed 1. Wait, but I need to be careful here. The harmonic series grows very slowly, but since ||Œ±|| is a fixed positive number (because Œ± is irrational), multiplying it by 1/6 and summing over q will eventually surpass any fixed number, including 1. So, putting it all together, by pairing denominators and using the properties of the distance to the nearest integer, I can establish that the sum of N_q(Œ±) up to some k will indeed exceed 1. I think this approach makes sense, but I should double-check the steps to ensure I haven't missed anything. Especially the part where I used the triangle inequality to get a lower bound on the norms. Also, approximating the denominator as 3q might be a bit hand-wavy, but since 2q+1 is roughly 2q, it should be acceptable for the purposes of establishing a lower bound.Yeah, I think this should work. The key idea is leveraging the divergence of the harmonic series and the properties of the distance to the nearest integer to show that the sum can be made arbitrarily large, thus exceeding 1 for some k."},{"question":"A technology company made a 5 million profit on its first some amount in sales and a 12 million profit on its next 30 million in sales. The ratio of profit to sales increased by 20.00000000000001% from the first sales to the next 30 million in sales. What was the amount of the first sales?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out the amount of the first sales for this technology company. Let's see, they made a 5 million profit on their first some amount in sales, and then a 12 million profit on the next 30 million in sales. The ratio of profit to sales increased by 20% from the first sales to the next 30 million. Hmm, okay, so I need to find that initial sales amount.Alright, let's break this down. First, let's think about what a profit ratio is. It's basically how much profit you make per dollar of sales. So, for the first sales amount, let's call it S, the profit ratio would be 5 million divided by S. That makes sense.Then, for the next 30 million in sales, they made a 12 million profit. So, the profit ratio here would be 12 million divided by 30 million. Let me calculate that: 12 divided by 30 is 0.4. So, the profit ratio for the next 30 million is 0.4, or 40%.Now, the problem says that the ratio of profit to sales increased by 20% from the first sales to the next 30 million. Wait, does that mean the profit ratio increased by 20 percentage points, or by 20% of the original ratio? I think it's the latter, meaning it's a 20% increase in the ratio itself.So, if the original profit ratio was R, then the new ratio is R plus 20% of R, which is 1.2 times R. That makes sense because a 20% increase would multiply the original ratio by 1.2.Okay, so we have the original ratio R = 5/S, and the new ratio is 12/30 = 0.4. According to the problem, 0.4 = 1.2 * (5/S). So, I can set up the equation like that.Let me write that out:0.4 = 1.2 * (5/S)Now, I need to solve for S. Let's do that step by step. First, I can simplify the right side of the equation. 1.2 times 5 is 6, so:0.4 = 6/SNow, I can rewrite this equation as:6/S = 0.4To solve for S, I can multiply both sides by S:6 = 0.4 * SThen, to isolate S, I divide both sides by 0.4:S = 6 / 0.4Calculating that, 6 divided by 0.4 is 15. So, S equals 15 million.Wait, let me double-check that. If the first sales were 15 million with a 5 million profit, the profit ratio is 5/15, which is approximately 0.3333 or 33.33%. Then, the next 30 million in sales had a profit ratio of 12/30, which is 0.4 or 40%. The increase from 33.33% to 40% is indeed a 20% increase because 40 is 1.2 times 33.33. So, that checks out.I think that makes sense. The first sales amount was 15 million."},{"question":"The two diagrams on the right show two arrows drawn in separate 4 cm times 4 cm grids. If these two arrows are drawn in the same 4 cm times 4 cm grid, what is the area of the overlapping part of the two arrows in square centimeters?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two arrows drawn on separate 4 cm by 4 cm grids. The question is asking me to find the area of the overlapping part when these two arrows are drawn on the same grid. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out how to approach this.First, I should probably visualize what these arrows look like. Since they're on a 4x4 grid, each grid square is 1 cm by 1 cm, right? So, the entire grid is 4 cm wide and 4 cm tall. Now, arrows can be of different shapes, but I think in this context, they're probably simple arrowheads, maybe pointing in different directions.I wonder if the arrows are identical or different. The problem doesn't specify, so I might have to assume they're similar but placed differently on the grid. Maybe one is pointing to the right and the other is pointing upwards or something like that.To find the overlapping area, I need to determine how much of the two arrows cover the same space on the grid. Since each grid square is 1 cm¬≤, if I can count the number of squares that are covered by both arrows, I can multiply that by 1 cm¬≤ to get the area.But wait, I don't have the actual diagrams. That might complicate things. Maybe I can think of a standard arrow shape. Typically, an arrowhead is a triangle with a tail. So, maybe each arrow is a triangle with a base of, say, 2 cm and a height of 2 cm. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's a different size.Alternatively, perhaps the arrows are made up of multiple squares. For example, an arrow pointing to the right might occupy squares in the middle row, starting from the left and going to the right, with the tip at the far right. Similarly, an arrow pointing upwards might occupy squares in the middle column, starting from the bottom and going up, with the tip at the top.If that's the case, then the overlapping area would be where these two arrows intersect. So, if one arrow is horizontal and the other is vertical, their overlap would be at the center square where they cross.But wait, if each arrow is more than just a single line, maybe they have some width. For example, the horizontal arrow might cover two rows in the middle, and the vertical arrow might cover two columns in the middle. In that case, their overlapping area would be a 2x2 square in the center, which would be 4 cm¬≤.But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe the arrows are more like triangles. Let me think. If each arrow is a triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 4 cm, then the area of each arrow would be (4*4)/2 = 8 cm¬≤. But since they're on a 4x4 grid, that might not make sense because the grid itself is 16 cm¬≤, and the arrow can't be 8 cm¬≤ if it's just an arrowhead.Wait, maybe the arrows are smaller. Maybe each arrow is a triangle with a base of 2 cm and a height of 2 cm, so the area would be 2 cm¬≤. But then, if they overlap, the overlapping area would be less.I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try to sketch it out mentally. Imagine a 4x4 grid. If I draw an arrow pointing to the right, it might start from the left edge and go to the right, with the tip at the center. Similarly, an arrow pointing upwards would start from the bottom and go up, with the tip at the center.If both arrows are pointing towards the center, their overlapping area would be around the center squares. Maybe the center 2x2 area is where they overlap.But I'm not sure. Maybe the arrows are only one square thick. So, the horizontal arrow would be a row of squares from left to right, and the vertical arrow would be a column of squares from bottom to top. Their overlap would be just the center square, which is 1 cm¬≤.But that seems too small. Maybe the arrows are two squares thick. So, the horizontal arrow would cover two rows, and the vertical arrow would cover two columns. Their overlap would be a 2x2 area, which is 4 cm¬≤.Alternatively, if the arrows are triangles, maybe the overlapping area is a smaller triangle or a diamond shape.Wait, I think I need to make some assumptions here because I don't have the actual diagrams. Let's assume that each arrow is a simple arrowhead made up of squares. For example, the horizontal arrow might cover squares in the second and third rows, spanning from the left to the center. Similarly, the vertical arrow might cover squares in the second and third columns, spanning from the bottom to the center.In that case, their overlapping area would be the squares where both arrows cover the same space, which would be the center 2x2 area. So, that would be 4 squares, each 1 cm¬≤, totaling 4 cm¬≤.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the arrows are only one square thick, so their overlap is just one square. Alternatively, if they're more complex, the overlap could be different.Wait, another approach: if each arrow is a triangle, then the area of each arrow would be (base * height)/2. If the base and height are both 4 cm, then the area is 8 cm¬≤. But since the grid is 4x4, that seems too big. Maybe the base and height are 2 cm each, giving an area of 2 cm¬≤ per arrow.If both arrows are 2 cm¬≤ each, and they overlap partially, the overlapping area would be less than 2 cm¬≤. Maybe 1 cm¬≤ or 2 cm¬≤.But without seeing the diagrams, it's hard to be precise. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about standard arrow shapes in grids.Alternatively, perhaps the arrows are made up of specific squares. For example, the horizontal arrow might cover squares (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and the vertical arrow might cover squares (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Then their overlap is just square (2,2), which is 1 cm¬≤.But that seems too simple. Maybe the arrows are larger. For example, the horizontal arrow could cover two rows, so squares (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), and the vertical arrow could cover two columns, so squares (2,1), (3,1), (2,2), (3,2), (2,3), (3,3), (2,4), (3,4). Then their overlap would be squares (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), which is 4 squares, so 4 cm¬≤.But I'm not sure if that's how the arrows are drawn. Maybe the arrows are only one square thick, so their overlap is just one square.Alternatively, maybe the arrows are L-shaped, covering more area. For example, the horizontal arrow could cover the top two rows and the vertical arrow could cover the left two columns, overlapping in the top-left 2x2 area.But again, without seeing the diagrams, it's hard to say. Maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is 6 cm¬≤, as that's a common answer for such problems, but I'm not sure.Wait, let me think differently. If each arrow is made up of 6 squares, and they overlap in some way, the overlapping area could be 6 cm¬≤. But that seems too much because the total grid is 16 cm¬≤, and two arrows each of 6 cm¬≤ would have a significant overlap.Alternatively, maybe the overlapping area is 4 cm¬≤, as I thought earlier.I think I need to make an educated guess here. Given that the grid is 4x4, and arrows are usually not too large, I would say the overlapping area is likely 4 cm¬≤. So, I'll go with that.But wait, another thought: if each arrow is a triangle covering 6 squares, their overlap could be 2 squares, so 2 cm¬≤. Hmm, I'm really not sure.Maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is 6 cm¬≤, as that's a common answer for such problems, but I'm not sure.Wait, no, 6 cm¬≤ seems too large for an overlapping area in a 4x4 grid. Maybe 4 cm¬≤ is more reasonable.Alternatively, perhaps the overlapping area is 2 cm¬≤.I think I need to make a decision here. Given the uncertainty, I'll go with 6 cm¬≤ as the overlapping area."},{"question":"Ten points are spaced equally around a circle.

(A chord is a straight line joining two points on the circumference of a circle.)(A) 9(B) 45(C) 17(D) 66(E) 55","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: there are ten points equally spaced around a circle, and I need to figure out how many different chords can be formed by joining any two of these points. The options given are (A) 9, (B) 45, (C) 17, (D) 66, and (E) 55. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First off, what exactly is a chord? Well, from what I remember, a chord is a straight line connecting two points on the circumference of a circle. So, in this case, each chord is just a straight line between any two of these ten points. That makes sense.Now, the question is asking how many different chords can be formed. So, essentially, I need to count all the unique straight lines that can be drawn between any two points out of these ten. At first glance, this seems like a combination problem because the order in which we pick the points doesn't matter. A chord from point A to point B is the same as from point B to point A.So, if I recall correctly, the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing. In this case, n is 10 (since there are ten points), and k is 2 (because a chord is formed by two points).Let me write that out: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!).Simplifying that, 10! is 10 factorial, which is 10 √ó 9 √ó 8 √ó 7 √ó 6 √ó 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1. But wait, in the denominator, we have 8! as well, which is 8 √ó 7 √ó 6 √ó 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1. So, when we divide 10! by 8!, a lot of terms cancel out.So, 10! / 8! = 10 √ó 9 √ó 8! / 8! = 10 √ó 9 = 90.Then, we have to divide by 2! in the denominator, which is 2 √ó 1 = 2.So, putting it all together: 90 / 2 = 45.Hmm, so that suggests there are 45 different chords. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something here. The points are equally spaced around the circle, so does that affect the number of unique chords? I mean, in a regular decagon (which is a ten-sided polygon), some chords might be of the same length, but does that mean they are not unique?Wait, the question is asking for different chords, not different lengths of chords. So, even if two chords are of the same length, they are still different chords because they connect different pairs of points. So, in that case, the number should indeed be 45.But let me double-check. If I have ten points on a circle, each point can be connected to nine other points, right? So, each point would have nine chords emanating from it. But if I just multiply 10 √ó 9, that gives me 90, which counts each chord twice because each chord connects two points. So, to get the actual number of unique chords, I need to divide by 2, which brings me back to 45.Okay, that seems consistent. So, both methods give me 45. Therefore, the answer should be 45, which is option (B).But wait, just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Could the question be asking for the number of unique chord lengths instead of the number of chords? That would be a different problem. For example, in a regular decagon, the number of unique chord lengths is equal to the number of distinct distances between any two points, which would be less than 45.But the question specifically says \\"different chords,\\" not \\"different lengths of chords.\\" So, I think it's safe to stick with the interpretation that it's asking for the number of unique chords, regardless of their length.Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 45, which is option (B).**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"1,800 fish swim westward, 3,200 swim eastward, and 500 swim north.

What fraction of the fish that swam eastward were caught by fishers?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of fish initially present in the sea. There are 1,800 fish swimming westward, 3,200 swimming eastward, and 500 swimming north. Adding these together gives a total of 5,500 fish.Next, I'll calculate the number of fish caught by the fishers. Fishers catch 3/4 of the fish swimming westward. So, 3/4 of 1,800 is 1,350 fish caught from the westward group.Let ( x ) represent the fraction of the eastward-swimming fish that were caught. Therefore, the number of fish caught from the eastward group is ( 3,200x ).The total number of fish caught by the fishers is the sum of the fish caught from both the westward and eastward groups: ( 1,350 + 3,200x ).According to the problem, there are 2,870 fish remaining in the sea after the fishers have caught some.

Let's think about what that means.Since 'x' is an integer, and it's between ( 2 - 3a ) and 15, the number of integer solutions depends on how many integers lie in that interval.We need exactly 4 integer solutions. Let's denote the smallest integer greater than ( 2 - 3a ) as 'n'. Then, the integers would be 'n', 'n+1', 'n+2', 'n+3'. So, the next integer after 'n+3' should be equal to 15 or greater, but since 'x' must be less than 15, the largest integer solution is 14.Therefore, the integer solutions are 11, 12, 13, 14.Wait, let me verify that. If the integer solutions are 11, 12, 13, 14, that's four integers. So, the smallest integer solution is 11, and the largest is 14.Therefore, the interval ( 2 - 3a < x < 15 ) must contain exactly these four integers. So, the lower bound ( 2 - 3a ) must be just below 11, and the upper bound is 15.So, ( 2 - 3a ) must be greater than 10 but less than or equal to 11.Wait, let me think again.If the integer solutions are 11, 12, 13, 14, then 'x' must be greater than 10 but less than 15. Because if 'x' is greater than 10, the smallest integer is 11, and less than 15, the largest integer is 14.Therefore, the lower bound ( 2 - 3a ) must satisfy:( 10 < 2 - 3a leq 11 )Wait, is that correct?Let me think. If ( 2 - 3a < x < 15 ), and the integer solutions are 11, 12, 13, 14, then:The smallest integer 'x' is 11, so ( 2 - 3a ) must be less than 11, but greater than 10, because if ( 2 - 3a ) were greater than or equal to 11, then 'x' would have to be at least 11, but 11 would not satisfy ( x > 2 - 3a ) if ( 2 - 3a ) is 11 or more.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach it differently.We have ( 2 - 3a < x < 15 ), and 'x' must be an integer with exactly four solutions: 11, 12, 13, 14.So, the smallest integer 'x' is 11, which means that ( 2 - 3a ) must be less than 11, but greater than 10. Because if ( 2 - 3a ) is less than or equal to 10, then 'x' could be 11, 12, 13, 14, but if ( 2 - 3a ) is greater than 10, say 10.5, then the smallest integer 'x' would still be 11.Wait, actually, if ( 2 - 3a ) is less than 11, then 'x' can be 11, 12, 13, 14.But we need exactly four integer solutions, so the lower bound must be such that the next integer above ( 2 - 3a ) is 11.So, ( 2 - 3a ) must be between 10 and 11.Wait, let's think about it numerically.If ( 2 - 3a = 10 ), then 'x' must be greater than 10, so the smallest integer 'x' is 11, and the largest is 14, giving four integers: 11, 12, 13, 14.If ( 2 - 3a = 11 ), then 'x' must be greater than 11, so the smallest integer 'x' is 12, and the largest is 14, giving three integers: 12, 13, 14.But we need exactly four integer solutions, so ( 2 - 3a ) must be less than 11 but greater than or equal to 10.Wait, no, if ( 2 - 3a ) is exactly 10, then 'x' must be greater than 10, so 'x' can be 11, 12, 13, 14.If ( 2 - 3a ) is greater than 10 but less than 11, say 10.5, then 'x' must be greater than 10.5, so the smallest integer 'x' is 11, and the largest is 14, still four integers.If ( 2 - 3a ) is less than or equal to 10, say 10, then 'x' can be 11, 12, 13, 14.Wait, but if ( 2 - 3a ) is less than 10, say 9, then 'x' can be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, which is five integers, which is more than four.So, to have exactly four integer solutions, ( 2 - 3a ) must be greater than 10 but less than or equal to 11.Wait, no, because if ( 2 - 3a ) is greater than 10, say 10.5, then 'x' must be greater than 10.5, so the smallest integer 'x' is 11, and the largest is 14, giving four integers.If ( 2 - 3a ) is exactly 10, then 'x' must be greater than 10, so the smallest integer 'x' is 11, and the largest is 14, still four integers.If ( 2 - 3a ) is less than 10, say 9, then 'x' can be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, which is five integers.Therefore, to have exactly four integer solutions, ( 2 - 3a ) must be greater than 10 but less than or equal to 11.Wait, but if ( 2 - 3a ) is exactly 11, then 'x' must be greater than 11, so the smallest integer 'x' is 12, and the largest is 14, giving three integers, which is less than four.Therefore, to have exactly four integer solutions, ( 2 - 3a ) must be greater than 10 but less than 11.So, ( 10 < 2 - 3a < 11 )Now, let's solve for 'a'.First, subtract 2 from all parts:( 10 - 2 < -3a < 11 - 2 )( 8 < -3a < 9 )Now, divide all parts by -3. But remember, when you divide or multiply by a negative number, the inequality signs reverse.So,( frac{8}{-3} > a > frac{9}{-3} )Simplify:( -frac{8}{3} > a > -3 )Or, equivalently,( -3 < a < -frac{8}{3} )Wait, but the problem says \\"has only 4 integer solutions\\", so we need to make sure that when ( 2 - 3a ) is exactly 10, 'x' can still be 11, 12, 13, 14.But if ( 2 - 3a = 10 ), then ( a = frac{2 - 10}{3} = frac{-8}{3} ).So, when ( a = -frac{8}{3} ), ( 2 - 3a = 10 ), so 'x' must be greater than 10, giving four integer solutions: 11, 12, 13, 14.Similarly, when ( a ) approaches -3 from the right, ( 2 - 3a ) approaches 11 from below, so 'x' must be greater than just below 11, so the smallest integer 'x' is 11, and the largest is 14, still four integers.But if ( a = -3 ), then ( 2 - 3a = 2 - (-9) = 11 ), so 'x' must be greater than 11, giving three integer solutions: 12, 13, 14.Therefore, to include the case where ( a = -frac{8}{3} ), which gives exactly four integer solutions, we need to include that endpoint.So, the range of 'a' is:( -3 < a leq -frac{8}{3} )Let me double-check.If ( a = -frac{8}{3} ), then ( 2 - 3a = 2 - 3*(-8/3) = 2 + 8 = 10 ). So, 'x' must be greater than 10, so integers 11, 12, 13, 14.If ( a ) is slightly greater than -3, say ( a = -2.9 ), then ( 2 - 3a = 2 - 3*(-2.9) = 2 + 8.7 = 10.7 ). So, 'x' must be greater than 10.7, so integers 11, 12, 13, 14.If ( a = -3 ), then ( 2 - 3a = 2 - 3*(-3) = 2 + 9 = 11 ). So, 'x' must be greater than 11, giving integers 12, 13, 14, which is only three solutions.Therefore, to have exactly four integer solutions, 'a' must be greater than -3 and less than or equal to -8/3.So, the range of 'a' is ( -3 < a leq -frac{8}{3} )."},{"question":"In circle O, four points P, A, B, Q lie on the circumference such that tangents to O at points A, B, and Q meet at point P outside the circle, and angle APB = 60^circ. Determine angle AQB.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a circle O with four points P, A, B, and Q on its circumference. The tangents to the circle at points A, B, and Q all meet at point P outside the circle. I'm given that the angle APB is 60 degrees, and I need to find the measure of angle AQB. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, I should probably draw a diagram to understand the setup better. There's a circle O, and points A, B, and Q are on the circumference. Point P is outside the circle, and from P, there are tangents to the circle at A, B, and Q. So, PA, PB, and PQ are all tangent segments from P to the circle.I remember that one of the properties of tangents is that the tangent from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, PA = PB = PQ. That might be useful later on.Now, the angle APB is given as 60 degrees. That's the angle between the two tangents PA and PB. I need to relate this angle to angle AQB, which is the angle subtended by points A and B at point Q on the circumference.I recall that the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, the angle APB is equal to half the difference of the measures of arcs AB and AQ. Wait, is that right? Let me think.Actually, the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, in this case, angle APB is equal to half the difference of the measure of arc AB and arc AQ. But since Q is another point on the circle where a tangent is drawn from P, I might need to consider the arcs more carefully.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the central angles. The angle at the center of the circle corresponding to arc AB would be twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc. But angle APB is not at the circumference; it's outside the circle. So, perhaps I need a different approach.Wait, I remember another property: the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the measure of the central angle subtended by the intercepted arc. So, angle APB = 180¬∞ - angle AOB, where angle AOB is the central angle for arc AB.Given that angle APB is 60¬∞, that would mean angle AOB is 180¬∞ - 60¬∞ = 120¬∞. So, the central angle AOB is 120 degrees.Now, angle AQB is the angle subtended by arc AB at point Q on the circumference. Since angle AOB is the central angle for arc AB, the measure of arc AB is equal to the measure of angle AOB, which is 120 degrees.But angle AQB is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc AB. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc. Therefore, angle AQB should be half of 120 degrees, which is 60 degrees.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. If angle AOB is 120¬∞, then arc AB is 120¬∞, and angle AQB, being an inscribed angle, is half that, so 60¬∞. That makes sense.But hold on, is there another way to look at this? Since Q is also a point where a tangent is drawn from P, does that affect angle AQB? Let me think.Point Q is on the circle, and PQ is a tangent at Q. So, the tangent at Q is perpendicular to the radius OQ. Similarly, PA and PB are tangents, so OA is perpendicular to PA, and OB is perpendicular to PB.So, OA is perpendicular to PA, and OB is perpendicular to PB. That means angles OAP and OBP are right angles (90 degrees). So, quadrilateral OAPB has two right angles at A and B.But I'm not sure if that directly helps with angle AQB. Maybe I should consider triangle AQB.In triangle AQB, angle AQB is the angle we need to find. The sides AQ and BQ are chords of the circle. The measure of angle AQB depends on the arcs it subtends.Wait, another thought: since PA, PB, and PQ are all tangents from point P, and PA = PB = PQ, triangle PAQ and triangle PBQ are congruent? Hmm, maybe not necessarily, because the lengths from P to A, B, and Q are equal, but the positions of A, B, and Q on the circle might vary.Alternatively, since PQ is a tangent at Q, and PA and PB are tangents at A and B, perhaps there's some symmetry here. Maybe points A, B, and Q are equally spaced around the circle? But I don't have enough information to confirm that.Wait, but earlier I concluded that angle AOB is 120¬∞, so arc AB is 120¬∞. If I can find the measure of arc AQ or arc BQ, that might help. But I don't have direct information about those arcs.However, since angle AQB is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AB, which is 120¬∞, then angle AQB is half of that, so 60¬∞. That seems consistent.Let me try to think if there's any other factor that could affect angle AQB. Since Q is another tangent point, does that mean that angle AQB is related to angle APB in some way? Maybe through some cyclic quadrilateral properties or something else.Wait, points A, B, Q, and P are all on the circumference? No, P is outside the circle, so it's not on the circumference. So, maybe not a cyclic quadrilateral.Alternatively, perhaps considering the power of point P with respect to circle O. The power of P is equal to PA¬≤ = PB¬≤ = PQ¬≤. That tells us that PA = PB = PQ, which we already knew.But how does that help with angle AQB? Maybe not directly.Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle APB. Since PA = PB and angle APB is 60¬∞, triangle APB is an equilateral triangle? Wait, if PA = PB and angle APB is 60¬∞, then yes, triangle APB is equilateral, so PA = PB = AB.But AB is a chord of the circle. So, chord AB has length equal to PA, which is a tangent from P.Hmm, interesting. So, chord AB is equal in length to the tangent from P to the circle. That might be useful in finding the radius or something else, but I'm not sure if it's necessary here.Wait, but if AB is equal to PA, and PA is a tangent, then maybe there's some relationship between the radius and the length of the tangent. The length of the tangent from P to the circle is equal to sqrt(OP¬≤ - r¬≤), where OP is the distance from P to the center O, and r is the radius.But without knowing OP or r, I can't compute that. Maybe it's not necessary for this problem.Going back, I think the key is that angle APB is 60¬∞, which relates to the central angle AOB being 120¬∞, and then angle AQB, being an inscribed angle subtended by arc AB, is half of 120¬∞, so 60¬∞. That seems straightforward.But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that angle AQB could be something else? For example, if Q is on the opposite side of the circle relative to AB, would that change the measure?Wait, in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle depends only on the arc it subtends, not on the position of the point on the circumference. So, regardless of where Q is on the circumference, as long as it's subtending arc AB, the measure of angle AQB will be half the measure of arc AB.Since arc AB is 120¬∞, angle AQB is 60¬∞. So, I think that's the answer.Just to recap:1. Angle APB is 60¬∞, which is the angle between two tangents from point P.2. The central angle AOB subtended by arc AB is twice the angle between the tangents, so 120¬∞.3. Angle AQB is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc AB, so it's half of 120¬∞, which is 60¬∞.Therefore, angle AQB is 60 degrees."},{"question":"A parking garage of a mall is four stories tall. On the first level, there are 90 parking spaces. The second level has 8 more parking spaces than on the first level, and there are 12 more available parking spaces on the third level than on the second level. The fourth level has 9 fewer parking spaces than the third level. If 100 cars are already parked, how many cars can be accommodated by the parking garage?","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of parking spaces on each level of the garage.Starting with the first level, there are 90 parking spaces.The second level has 8 more spaces than the first level, so it has 90 + 8 = 98 spaces.The third level has 12 more spaces than the second level, which means it has 98 + 12 = 110 spaces.The fourth level has 9 fewer spaces than the third level, so it has 110 - 9 = 101 spaces.Next, I'll add up all the parking spaces across the four levels to find the total number of spaces in the garage.Total parking spaces = 90 (first level) + 98 (second level) + 110 (third level) + 101 (fourth level) = 399 spaces.Since 100 cars are already parked, I'll subtract that number from the total to find out how many more cars can be accommodated.Available parking spaces = 399 (total spaces) - 100 (cars already parked) = 299 spaces.Therefore, the parking garage can accommodate 299 more cars."},{"question":"For the function f(x), the process of solving it within its domain using the bisection method is as follows: f(2007) < 0, f(2008) < 0, f(2009) > 0; then, among the following statements, the correct one is („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: The function f(x) does not have a zero point in the interval (2007, 2008)B: The function f(x) does not have a zero point in the interval (2008, 2009)C: The function f(x) has exactly one zero point in the interval (2008, 2009)D: The function f(x) may have a zero point in the interval (2007, 2008)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the function ( f(x) ) and using the bisection method to find a zero point. The given information is that ( f(2007) < 0 ), ( f(2008) < 0 ), and ( f(2009) > 0 ). I need to figure out which of the statements A, B, C, or D is correct.First, I remember that the bisection method is used to find roots of a continuous function within a given interval. The key idea is that if the function changes sign over an interval, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one root in that interval.Looking at the given values:- At ( x = 2007 ), ( f(x) ) is negative.- At ( x = 2008 ), ( f(x) ) is still negative.- At ( x = 2009 ), ( f(x) ) becomes positive.So, between 2007 and 2008, the function is negative at both ends. That means there's no sign change in that interval, right? So, according to the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can't guarantee a root in (2007, 2008) because the function doesn't cross zero there. It stays negative the whole time.But between 2008 and 2009, the function goes from negative at 2008 to positive at 2009. That's a sign change from negative to positive. So, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one root in that interval. So, that would mean statement B is incorrect because it says there's no zero point in (2008, 2009), but actually, there must be at least one.Now, looking at the options:- A: The function doesn't have a zero in (2007, 2008). Well, since the function is negative at both ends, it's possible there's no zero, but it's also possible that there is a zero if the function dips below and then comes back up, but without a sign change, we can't be sure. Wait, actually, if the function is continuous and doesn't change sign, it can't have a zero in that interval. So, maybe A is correct? Hmm, but I thought the Intermediate Value Theorem only tells us about sign changes. If there's no sign change, it doesn't necessarily mean there's no zero; it just means we can't guarantee one. Wait, no, if the function is continuous and doesn't change sign, it can't cross zero. So, actually, A might be correct because if ( f(2007) < 0 ) and ( f(2008) < 0 ), and it's continuous, then it can't cross zero in between. So, A is correct? But I need to check the options again.Wait, the options are:A: Does not have a zero in (2007, 2008)B: Does not have a zero in (2008, 2009)C: Has exactly one zero in (2008, 2009)D: May have a zero in (2007, 2008)So, from what I understand:- In (2007, 2008): f is negative at both ends, so no sign change. Therefore, no zero in that interval. So A is correct, D is incorrect because it says \\"may have,\\" but actually, it cannot have a zero there.Wait, but the initial thought was that D is correct. Maybe I'm confused.Wait, let me think again. The Intermediate Value Theorem says that if a function is continuous on [a, b], and if it takes values f(a) and f(b) at each end of the interval, then it also takes any value between f(a) and f(b) at some point in the interval. So, if f(a) and f(b) are both negative, then the function doesn't cross zero, so no zero in that interval. So, A is correct because there's no zero in (2007, 2008). But the solution given says D is correct, which says \\"may have a zero in (2007, 2008).\\" That seems contradictory.Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The bisection method requires that the function changes sign in the interval to apply. So, if the function doesn't change sign, the bisection method can't be applied, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's no zero. Wait, no, if the function is continuous and doesn't change sign, then it can't have a zero in that interval. So, A is correct because it's impossible for f(x) to have a zero in (2007, 2008) since it's negative at both ends.But the solution says D is correct. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.The question says: \\"the process of solving it within its domain using the bisection method is as follows: f(2007) < 0, f(2008) < 0, f(2009) > 0; then, among the following statements, the correct one is...\\"So, the bisection method process is given with these three points. So, in the first step, we check f(2007) and f(2008), both negative, so we move to the next interval. Then, we check f(2008) and f(2009), one negative, one positive, so we know there's a root in (2008, 2009). So, the bisection method would focus on that interval.But the question is about the statements given. So, A says there's no zero in (2007, 2008). Since f(2007) and f(2008) are both negative, and assuming continuity, there can't be a zero in that interval. So, A is correct.But the solution says D is correct, which says \\"may have a zero in (2007, 2008).\\" That seems wrong because it can't have a zero there.Wait, maybe the function isn't necessarily continuous? But the bisection method requires continuity to apply the Intermediate Value Theorem. So, if f is continuous, then A is correct. But if f isn't continuous, then maybe it could have a zero in (2007, 2008). But the problem doesn't specify whether f is continuous or not. Hmm, that's a good point.Wait, the problem says \\"the process of solving it within its domain using the bisection method.\\" The bisection method assumes continuity, so f must be continuous. Therefore, A is correct because f doesn't change sign in (2007, 2008), so no zero there.But the solution says D is correct. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think again.Wait, the problem says \\"the process of solving it within its domain using the bisection method is as follows: f(2007) < 0, f(2008) < 0, f(2009) > 0.\\" So, the bisection method is being applied, and in the first step, we check f(2007) and f(2008), both negative, so we narrow down to (2008, 2009). So, in that case, the bisection method tells us that the root is in (2008, 2009). Therefore, the function must have a root in (2008, 2009), so B is incorrect because it says there's no zero there. C says it has exactly one zero, but the Intermediate Value Theorem only guarantees at least one, not exactly one. So, C is incorrect. D says \\"may have a zero in (2007, 2008).\\" But since f(2007) and f(2008) are both negative, and assuming continuity, it can't have a zero there. So, D is incorrect.Wait, but the solution says D is correct. Maybe the problem is that the function could have a zero in (2007, 2008) if it's not continuous? But the bisection method requires continuity. So, maybe the problem is assuming continuity, so A is correct. But the solution says D is correct. Maybe I'm missing something.Alternatively, maybe the function could have a zero in (2007, 2008) if it's not strictly increasing or decreasing. But even so, if it's continuous and doesn't change sign, it can't have a zero. So, I'm confused why the solution says D is correct.Wait, maybe the problem is that the bisection method is being applied, and the initial interval is (2007, 2009). So, in the first step, we check f(2007) < 0, f(2008) < 0, so we narrow down to (2008, 2009). But the question is about the statements. So, A says there's no zero in (2007, 2008). Since f(2007) and f(2008) are both negative, and assuming continuity, A is correct. So, why does the solution say D is correct?Wait, maybe the problem is that the function could have a zero in (2007, 2008) if it's not monotonic. But even if it's not monotonic, if it's continuous and doesn't change sign, it can't have a zero. So, I think A is correct, but the solution says D. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the function could have a zero in (2007, 2008) if it's not continuous. But the bisection method requires continuity, so f must be continuous. Therefore, A is correct.Wait, maybe the problem is that the function could have a zero in (2007, 2008) if it's not strictly increasing or decreasing, but even so, without a sign change, it can't cross zero. So, I think A is correct.But the solution says D is correct. Maybe the solution is wrong? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.Wait, let me read the problem again:\\"For the function ( f(x) ), the process of solving it within its domain using the bisection method is as follows: ( f(2007) < 0 ), ( f(2008) < 0 ), ( f(2009) > 0 ); then, among the following statements, the correct one is („ÄÄ„ÄÄ)A: The function ( f(x) ) does not have a zero point in the interval ( (2007, 2008) )B: The function ( f(x) ) does not have a zero point in the interval ( (2008, 2009) )C: The function ( f(x) ) has exactly one zero point in the interval ( (2008, 2009) )D: The function ( f(x) ) may have a zero point in the interval ( (2007, 2008) )\\"So, the process of solving using the bisection method is given, which implies that the function is continuous, as the bisection method requires continuity.Given that, since ( f(2007) < 0 ) and ( f(2008) < 0 ), the function doesn't change sign in (2007, 2008), so there can't be a zero in that interval.

If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for nine days and the pieces of fruit within each category except the pear are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Cory has 4 apples, 2 oranges, 2 bananas, and 1 pear. He eats one piece of fruit each day for nine days. I need to figure out how many different orders he can eat these fruits. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I should figure out the total number of fruits Cory has. Let me add them up: 4 apples + 2 oranges + 2 bananas + 1 pear. That gives me 4 + 2 + 2 + 1, which equals 9 fruits in total. Okay, so he's going to eat one each day for nine days, which makes sense.Now, the question is about the number of different orders he can eat these fruits. Since the fruits within each category (except the pear) are indistinguishable, I think this is a permutations problem with repeated elements. I remember that when you have multiple items that are the same, the number of unique arrangements is calculated by dividing the factorial of the total number of items by the product of the factorials of the counts of each identical item.So, in formula terms, if I have n items where there are duplicates, the number of unique permutations is n! divided by (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of each identical item.Applying that to this problem, the total number of fruits is 9, so n is 9. The counts of each fruit are 4 apples, 2 oranges, 2 bananas, and 1 pear. So, plugging into the formula, it should be 9! divided by (4! * 2! * 2! * 1!).Let me write that out:Number of orders = 9! / (4! * 2! * 2! * 1!)Now, I need to compute this. Let's calculate each factorial step by step.First, 9! is 9 factorial, which is 9 √ó 8 √ó 7 √ó 6 √ó 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1. I know that 9! is 362880.Next, 4! is 4 factorial, which is 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1, so that's 24.Then, 2! is 2 factorial, which is 2 √ó 1, so that's 2. There are two 2! terms because of the oranges and bananas, each with 2 fruits.And finally, 1! is just 1, since 1 factorial is 1.So, plugging these numbers into the formula:Number of orders = 362880 / (24 * 2 * 2 * 1)Let me compute the denominator first: 24 * 2 is 48, then 48 * 2 is 96, and 96 * 1 is still 96.So now, the formula simplifies to 362880 divided by 96.Let me do that division. 362880 divided by 96. Hmm, let's see:First, I can simplify both numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 16. 96 divided by 16 is 6, and 362880 divided by 16 is 22680.So now, it's 22680 divided by 6. Let me compute that: 22680 divided by 6. 6 goes into 22 three times (18), remainder 4. Bring down the 6 to make 46. 6 goes into 46 seven times (42), remainder 4. Bring down the 8 to make 48. 6 goes into 48 eight times. Bring down the 0. 6 goes into 0 zero times. So, putting it all together, that's 3780.Wait, let me double-check that division to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Alternatively, I can do 362880 divided by 96 step by step.First, 96 goes into 362 how many times? 96 √ó 3 is 288, which is less than 362. 96 √ó 4 is 384, which is too much. So, 3 times. 3 √ó 96 is 288. Subtract that from 362: 362 - 288 is 74.Bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 748.96 goes into 748 how many times? Let's see: 96 √ó 7 is 672, 96 √ó 8 is 768. 768 is too much, so 7 times. 7 √ó 96 is 672. Subtract from 748: 748 - 672 is 76.Bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 768.96 goes into 768 exactly 8 times because 96 √ó 8 is 768. Subtract that, and we have 0.Bring down the next digit, which is 0.96 goes into 0 zero times. So, we have 3780.Yes, that matches my previous result. So, 362880 divided by 96 is indeed 3780.Therefore, the number of different orders Cory can eat his fruits is 3780.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me verify the factorial values again.9! is 362880, correct.4! is 24, correct.2! is 2, correct.So, 24 √ó 2 √ó 2 √ó 1 is 96, correct.362880 divided by 96 is 3780, correct.Okay, I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 3780 different orders.**Final Answer**The number of orders Cory can eat the fruit is boxed{3780}."},{"question":"If the graph of the function f(x)=sin omega x is shifted to the left by frac{pi}{3} units and coincides with the graph of the function y=cos omega x, what could be the value of omega? (quad)A: frac{1}{3}B: frac{1}{2}C: frac{2}{3}D: frac{3}{2}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about shifting the graph of a sine function and having it coincide with a cosine function. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, the function given is f(x) = sin(œâx). They say that if we shift this graph to the left by œÄ/3 units, it will coincide with the graph of y = cos(œâx). I need to find the value of œâ from the given options.Alright, shifting a graph to the left by œÄ/3 units means that we replace x with (x + œÄ/3) in the function. So, the shifted function becomes sin(œâ(x + œÄ/3)). Let me write that down:Shifted function: sin(œâ(x + œÄ/3)) = sin(œâx + œâœÄ/3)Now, this shifted sine function is supposed to coincide with y = cos(œâx). So, we have:sin(œâx + œâœÄ/3) = cos(œâx)Hmm, I remember that sine and cosine are related by a phase shift. Specifically, sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/2) = cos(Œ∏). So, maybe I can use that identity here.Let me rewrite the equation:sin(œâx + œâœÄ/3) = sin(œâx + œÄ/2 + 2œÄk), where k is an integer because sine functions are periodic with period 2œÄ.Wait, actually, the general identity is sin(Œ∏) = cos(Œ∏ - œÄ/2). So, maybe another way to write cos(œâx) is sin(œâx + œÄ/2). Let me check that:cos(œâx) = sin(œâx + œÄ/2)Yes, that seems right because cos(Œ∏) = sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/2). So, substituting back into the equation:sin(œâx + œâœÄ/3) = sin(œâx + œÄ/2)Since the sine functions are equal, their arguments must differ by an integer multiple of 2œÄ or be supplementary angles differing by an integer multiple of 2œÄ. So, we have two cases:1. œâx + œâœÄ/3 = œâx + œÄ/2 + 2œÄk2. œâx + œâœÄ/3 = œÄ - (œâx + œÄ/2) + 2œÄkLet me simplify both cases.Starting with the first case:œâx + œâœÄ/3 = œâx + œÄ/2 + 2œÄkSubtract œâx from both sides:œâœÄ/3 = œÄ/2 + 2œÄkDivide both sides by œÄ:œâ/3 = 1/2 + 2kMultiply both sides by 3:œâ = 3/2 + 6kSince œâ is a real number and the options given are positive fractions, let's see what k can be. If k = 0, œâ = 3/2. If k = 1, œâ = 9/2, which isn't an option. Negative k would give negative œâ, which doesn't make sense here because frequency is positive. So, œâ = 3/2 is a possible solution.Now, let's check the second case:œâx + œâœÄ/3 = œÄ - (œâx + œÄ/2) + 2œÄkSimplify the right side:œÄ - œâx - œÄ/2 + 2œÄk = (œÄ - œÄ/2) - œâx + 2œÄk = œÄ/2 - œâx + 2œÄkSo, the equation becomes:œâx + œâœÄ/3 = œÄ/2 - œâx + 2œÄkBring all terms to one side:œâx + œâœÄ/3 + œâx - œÄ/2 - 2œÄk = 0Combine like terms:2œâx + œâœÄ/3 - œÄ/2 - 2œÄk = 0Hmm, this equation has an x term, which suggests that unless the coefficient of x is zero, the equation can't hold for all x. So, let's set the coefficient of x to zero:2œâ = 0 => œâ = 0But œâ = 0 would make the function f(x) = sin(0) = 0, which is a constant function, not a sine or cosine wave. So, this case doesn't give a valid solution.Therefore, the only valid solution comes from the first case, which is œâ = 3/2 + 6k. As we saw earlier, the only feasible value from the options given is œâ = 3/2 when k = 0.Let me double-check by plugging œâ = 3/2 back into the shifted function:Shifted function: sin((3/2)(x + œÄ/3)) = sin((3/2)x + (3/2)(œÄ/3)) = sin((3/2)x + œÄ/2)And cos(œâx) = cos((3/2)x). Using the identity cos(Œ∏) = sin(Œ∏ + œÄ/2), we have:cos((3/2)x) = sin((3/2)x + œÄ/2)Which matches the shifted function. So, yes, it works.I think that's solid. So, the answer should be D: 3/2.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"In the countries of Dillia and Dallia, the currencies are dillars and dallars respectively. In Dillia, a dillar is exchanged for 10 dallars, while in Dallia, a dallar is exchanged for 10 dillars. A novice financier has 1 dillar and can freely travel from one country to the other, exchanging money in both countries. Prove that the number of dallars can never equal the number of dillars for them.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two countries, Dillia and Dallia, with their own currencies: dillars and dallars. The exchange rates are a bit tricky: in Dillia, 1 dilar can be exchanged for 10 dallars, and in Dallia, 1 daller can be exchanged for 10 dillars. A person starts with 1 dilar and can move freely between the countries, exchanging money as they go. The goal is to prove that the number of dallars can never equal the number of dillars for them.Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this. So, starting with 1 dilar, which is worth 10 dallars in Dillia. If I exchange that 1 dilar, I get 10 dallars. Then, in Dallia, each daller can be exchanged back for 10 dillars. So, if I have 10 dallars, I could exchange them all back to get 100 dillars. Wait, that seems like a lot. But then, if I have 100 dillars, I could exchange those again for 1000 dallars, and so on. It seems like the amounts could grow exponentially.But the question is about whether the number of dallars can ever equal the number of dillars. So, starting with 1 dilar, which is 10 dallars. So, initially, I have 1 dilar and 10 dallars. That's not equal. If I exchange the 10 dallars back to dillars, I get 100 dillars. Now I have 100 dillars and 0 dallars. Still not equal. If I exchange 1 dilar for 10 dallars, I have 99 dillars and 10 dallars. Still not equal. If I keep doing this, exchanging dillars for dallars and vice versa, will I ever reach a point where the number of dillars equals the number of dallars?Let me think about the possible amounts. Each time I exchange, I'm either multiplying the number of dillars by 10 or dividing the number of dallars by 10. So, the number of dillars is always a multiple of 10^n, and the number of dallars is also a multiple of 10^n, but offset by the initial exchange.Wait, maybe I should model this mathematically. Let me denote D as the number of dillars and A as the number of dallars. Initially, D = 1 and A = 0. When I exchange 1 dilar for 10 dallars, D becomes 0 and A becomes 10. Then, if I exchange 10 dallars back, D becomes 100 and A becomes 0. If I exchange 1 dilar again, D becomes 99 and A becomes 10. If I exchange 10 dallars, D becomes 100 + 10 = 110 and A becomes 0. Hmm, this seems like a cycle where D and A are always multiples of 10, but never equal.But wait, maybe there's a way to have both D and A be non-zero at the same time. For example, if I have 1 dilar and 10 dallars, I could exchange some of the dillars and some of the dallars. But the problem is, each exchange requires converting all of one currency to the other. Or does it? The problem says \\"freely travel from one country to the other, exchanging money in both countries.\\" It doesn't specify whether you have to exchange all of one currency or just some. If you can exchange any amount, then maybe you can have partial exchanges.But the problem statement doesn't specify, so I think we have to assume that you can exchange any amount, not necessarily all of one currency. So, for example, if I have D dillars and A dallars, I can choose to exchange x dillars for 10x dallars, or exchange y dallars for 10y dillars, where x and y are any positive integers less than or equal to D or A, respectively.So, the key is to see if there's a sequence of exchanges where D = A. Let's try to see if that's possible.Starting with D = 1, A = 0.If I exchange 1 dilar for 10 dallars, I get D = 0, A = 10.If I exchange 10 dallars back, I get D = 100, A = 0.If I exchange 1 dilar for 10 dallars, I get D = 99, A = 10.If I exchange 10 dallars back, I get D = 109, A = 0.Wait, this seems like D is always a multiple of 10 plus or minus something, and A is a multiple of 10. Maybe I can represent D and A in terms of powers of 10.Let me think about the invariant. Maybe there's an invariant here that prevents D and A from being equal.An invariant is a property that remains unchanged regardless of the operations performed. So, if I can find an invariant that is always true, and if D = A would violate that invariant, then D can never equal A.What could that invariant be?Looking at the exchange rates, 1 dilar = 10 dallars and 1 daller = 10 dillars. So, the exchange rates are inverses of each other, scaled by a factor of 10.If I think in terms of modulo arithmetic, maybe modulo 11, since 10 is congruent to -1 modulo 11. That might be useful.Let me try to define an invariant based on modulo 11.Let me denote the invariant as D - A modulo 11.Initially, D = 1, A = 0, so D - A = 1 modulo 11.Now, let's see what happens when we perform an exchange.Case 1: Exchange x dillars for 10x dallars.Then, D becomes D - x, and A becomes A + 10x.The new invariant is (D - x) - (A + 10x) = D - A - 11x.Since 11x is congruent to 0 modulo 11, the invariant remains D - A modulo 11.Case 2: Exchange y dallars for 10y dillars.Then, D becomes D + 10y, and A becomes A - y.The new invariant is (D + 10y) - (A - y) = D - A + 11y.Again, 11y is congruent to 0 modulo 11, so the invariant remains D - A modulo 11.Therefore, the invariant D - A modulo 11 is preserved regardless of the exchanges.Initially, D - A = 1 modulo 11.If at any point D = A, then D - A = 0 modulo 11.But since the invariant is always 1 modulo 11, it can never be 0 modulo 11.Therefore, D can never equal A.That seems to be the proof. The invariant D - A modulo 11 is always 1, so D and A can never be equal."},{"question":"Find all values of the parameter ( b ) such that the system[left{begin{array}{l}x cos a-y sin a-3 leqslant 0 x^{2}+y^{2}-8 x+2 y-b^{2}-6 b+8=0end{array}right.]has at least one solution for any value of the parameter ( a ).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find all values of the parameter ( b ) such that the system of equations has at least one solution for any value of the parameter ( a ). The system is:[left{begin{array}{l}x cos a - y sin a - 3 leqslant 0 x^{2} + y^{2} - 8 x + 2 y - b^{2} - 6 b + 8 = 0end{array}right.]Okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, looking at the first inequality: ( x cos a - y sin a - 3 leqslant 0 ). This looks like a linear inequality in terms of ( x ) and ( y ), but it's parameterized by ( a ). I remember that expressions like ( x cos a - y sin a ) often relate to projections or distances in geometry. Maybe it's the equation of a line?Yes, actually, ( x cos a - y sin a = 3 ) is the equation of a line in the form ( x cos theta - y sin theta = p ), which represents a line at a distance ( |p| ) from the origin, making an angle ( theta ) with the x-axis. So in this case, the line is at a distance of 3 units from the origin, and the inequality ( leqslant 0 ) means we're looking at the half-plane that includes the origin.So, for any angle ( a ), this inequality defines a half-plane that's always on one side of the line, and since the distance is 3, the origin is always inside this half-plane.Now, the second equation is a quadratic in ( x ) and ( y ): ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 8 x + 2 y - b^{2} - 6 b + 8 = 0 ). This looks like the equation of a circle. Let me try to rewrite it in standard form by completing the squares.Starting with ( x^{2} - 8x ) and ( y^{2} + 2y ):For the ( x )-terms: ( x^{2} - 8x ). To complete the square, take half of -8, which is -4, square it to get 16. So, ( x^{2} - 8x = (x - 4)^2 - 16 ).For the ( y )-terms: ( y^{2} + 2y ). Half of 2 is 1, squared is 1. So, ( y^{2} + 2y = (y + 1)^2 - 1 ).Putting it all back into the equation:[(x - 4)^2 - 16 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 - b^{2} - 6b + 8 = 0]Simplify the constants:-16 -1 +8 = -9So,[(x - 4)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 9 - b^{2} - 6b = 0]Which can be written as:[(x - 4)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = b^{2} + 6b + 9]Notice that ( b^{2} + 6b + 9 ) is a perfect square: ( (b + 3)^2 ). So, the equation becomes:[(x - 4)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = (b + 3)^2]So, this is a circle with center at ( (4, -1) ) and radius ( |b + 3| ). Since the radius can't be negative, it's just ( |b + 3| ).Now, the problem states that the system has at least one solution for any value of ( a ). That means, no matter what angle ( a ) we choose, the line ( x cos a - y sin a = 3 ) must intersect the circle ( (x - 4)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = (b + 3)^2 ).In other words, for every possible line at distance 3 from the origin, the circle must intersect it. So, the circle must be large enough to intersect every such line.Alternatively, since these lines are all tangent to the circle centered at the origin with radius 3, the given circle must intersect every tangent to this circle. That implies that the given circle must enclose the origin's circle or be tangent to it.Wait, let me think. If the given circle must intersect every tangent to the circle of radius 3 centered at the origin, then the distance between the centers of the two circles must be less than or equal to the sum of their radii, and also greater than or equal to the difference of their radii.But in this case, the circle we have is centered at ( (4, -1) ) with radius ( |b + 3| ), and the other circle is centered at ( (0, 0) ) with radius 3.So, the distance between the centers is ( sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2} = sqrt{16 + 1} = sqrt{17} ).For the two circles to intersect, the sum of their radii must be greater than or equal to the distance between centers, and the absolute difference of their radii must be less than or equal to the distance between centers.So, the conditions are:1. ( |b + 3| + 3 geq sqrt{17} )2. ( ||b + 3| - 3| leq sqrt{17} )But since we need the circle ( (x - 4)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = (b + 3)^2 ) to intersect every tangent line to the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), which is equivalent to the given circle intersecting the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ).Wait, actually, if the given circle intersects every tangent to the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), then it must enclose the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ) or be tangent to it. Because if it doesn't enclose it, there might be some tangents that don't intersect the given circle.So, to ensure that the given circle intersects every tangent to the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), the given circle must contain the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ) or be tangent to it.Therefore, the distance between centers ( sqrt{17} ) must be less than or equal to the difference of the radii.Wait, no, if the given circle is to contain the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), then the distance between centers plus the radius of the smaller circle must be less than or equal to the radius of the larger circle.So, ( |b + 3| geq sqrt{17} + 3 ).Alternatively, if the given circle is tangent to the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), then the distance between centers is equal to the sum or difference of radii.But in this case, since we need the given circle to intersect every tangent, which is equivalent to containing the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), the radius of the given circle must be at least ( sqrt{17} + 3 ).Wait, let me think again.If the given circle must intersect every tangent to the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), then the given circle must be such that the minimal distance from its center to the origin is less than or equal to the sum of their radii.But actually, the minimal distance from the given circle to the origin is ( | |b + 3| - sqrt{17} | ). For the given circle to intersect every tangent to ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), the minimal distance must be less than or equal to 3, the radius of the origin circle.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.The condition is that for every ( a ), the line ( x cos a - y sin a = 3 ) intersects the circle ( (x - 4)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = (b + 3)^2 ).So, for each ( a ), the distance from the center of the circle ( (4, -1) ) to the line ( x cos a - y sin a = 3 ) must be less than or equal to the radius ( |b + 3| ).Because if the distance from the center to the line is less than or equal to the radius, the line intersects the circle.So, the distance from ( (4, -1) ) to the line ( x cos a - y sin a = 3 ) is:[frac{|4 cos a - (-1) sin a - 3|}{sqrt{cos^2 a + sin^2 a}} = |4 cos a + sin a - 3|]Since ( sqrt{cos^2 a + sin^2 a} = 1 ).So, the distance is ( |4 cos a + sin a - 3| ).For the line to intersect the circle, this distance must be less than or equal to ( |b + 3| ).Therefore, for all ( a ), we must have:[|4 cos a + sin a - 3| leq |b + 3|]So, ( |b + 3| ) must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of ( |4 cos a + sin a - 3| ) over all ( a ).Therefore, ( |b + 3| geq max_{a} |4 cos a + sin a - 3| ).So, I need to find the maximum of ( |4 cos a + sin a - 3| ) as ( a ) varies.Let me denote ( f(a) = 4 cos a + sin a - 3 ). We need to find the maximum of ( |f(a)| ).First, let's find the maximum and minimum of ( f(a) ).The expression ( 4 cos a + sin a ) can be written as ( R cos(a - phi) ), where ( R = sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{17} ), and ( phi = arctanleft(frac{1}{4}right) ).So, ( 4 cos a + sin a = sqrt{17} cos(a - phi) ).Therefore, ( f(a) = sqrt{17} cos(a - phi) - 3 ).The maximum value of ( cos(a - phi) ) is 1, and the minimum is -1.Therefore, the maximum value of ( f(a) ) is ( sqrt{17} - 3 ), and the minimum is ( -sqrt{17} - 3 ).Therefore, ( |f(a)| ) reaches its maximum at either ( sqrt{17} - 3 ) or ( |-sqrt{17} - 3| = sqrt{17} + 3 ).But ( sqrt{17} + 3 ) is clearly larger than ( sqrt{17} - 3 ), so the maximum of ( |f(a)| ) is ( sqrt{17} + 3 ).Wait, but hold on. If ( f(a) ) can be as low as ( -sqrt{17} - 3 ), then ( |f(a)| ) can be as high as ( sqrt{17} + 3 ).But is that correct? Let me check.If ( f(a) = sqrt{17} cos(a - phi) - 3 ), then:- The maximum of ( f(a) ) is ( sqrt{17} - 3 ).- The minimum of ( f(a) ) is ( -sqrt{17} - 3 ).Therefore, ( |f(a)| ) can be as large as ( sqrt{17} + 3 ) when ( f(a) ) is negative, because ( | -sqrt{17} - 3 | = sqrt{17} + 3 ).So, the maximum of ( |f(a)| ) is ( sqrt{17} + 3 ).Therefore, to satisfy ( |4 cos a + sin a - 3| leq |b + 3| ) for all ( a ), we need:[|b + 3| geq sqrt{17} + 3]But wait, that seems too large. Because if ( |b + 3| geq sqrt{17} + 3 ), then ( b + 3 geq sqrt{17} + 3 ) or ( b + 3 leq -(sqrt{17} + 3) ).Which simplifies to:1. ( b geq sqrt{17} )2. ( b leq -sqrt{17} - 6 )But let me think again. If ( |b + 3| geq sqrt{17} + 3 ), then yes, that's correct.But wait, the maximum of ( |f(a)| ) is ( sqrt{17} + 3 ), so ( |b + 3| ) must be at least that. So, ( |b + 3| geq sqrt{17} + 3 ).Which leads to ( b + 3 geq sqrt{17} + 3 ) or ( b + 3 leq -(sqrt{17} + 3) ).Therefore, ( b geq sqrt{17} ) or ( b leq -sqrt{17} - 6 ).But let me check if this makes sense.If ( b geq sqrt{17} ), then the radius ( |b + 3| ) is at least ( sqrt{17} + 3 ), which is quite large. Similarly, if ( b leq -sqrt{17} - 6 ), then ( |b + 3| = | -sqrt{17} - 6 + 3 | = | -sqrt{17} - 3 | = sqrt{17} + 3 ).So, in both cases, the radius is at least ( sqrt{17} + 3 ), which is necessary to ensure that the circle is large enough to intersect every tangent line.But wait, is this the only condition? Because if the radius is exactly ( sqrt{17} + 3 ), then the circle will be tangent to the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ). But if the radius is larger, it will enclose it.But in our case, we need the circle to intersect every tangent line to ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ). So, if the radius is exactly ( sqrt{17} + 3 ), it will be tangent to the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), meaning that for the tangent lines that are farthest away, the given circle will just touch them. For all other lines, it will intersect them.If the radius is larger, the circle will enclose the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), meaning that every tangent line will intersect the given circle.Therefore, the condition ( |b + 3| geq sqrt{17} + 3 ) ensures that the circle is large enough to intersect all tangent lines.But wait, let me think about the case when ( |b + 3| = sqrt{17} + 3 ). Then, the circle is tangent to the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ). So, for the tangent line that is farthest from the center ( (4, -1) ), the given circle will just touch it. For all other lines, it will intersect them.But the problem states that the system must have at least one solution for any ( a ). So, even if the circle is tangent to the farthest tangent line, it still has a solution (the point of tangency). So, that's acceptable.Therefore, the values of ( b ) must satisfy ( |b + 3| geq sqrt{17} + 3 ).Solving this inequality:Case 1: ( b + 3 geq sqrt{17} + 3 ) leads to ( b geq sqrt{17} ).Case 2: ( b + 3 leq -(sqrt{17} + 3) ) leads to ( b leq -sqrt{17} - 6 ).Therefore, the values of ( b ) are ( b leq -sqrt{17} - 6 ) or ( b geq sqrt{17} ).But let me double-check if this is correct.Suppose ( b = sqrt{17} ). Then, the radius is ( sqrt{17} + 3 ). The distance between centers is ( sqrt{17} ). So, the circle centered at ( (4, -1) ) with radius ( sqrt{17} + 3 ) will enclose the origin circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 9 ), because the distance between centers is ( sqrt{17} ), and the radius is ( sqrt{17} + 3 ), which is greater than ( sqrt{17} ). So, yes, it will enclose it.Similarly, if ( b = -sqrt{17} - 6 ), then ( |b + 3| = | -sqrt{17} - 6 + 3 | = | -sqrt{17} - 3 | = sqrt{17} + 3 ). So, same radius, same reasoning.If ( b ) is between ( -sqrt{17} - 6 ) and ( sqrt{17} ), then ( |b + 3| < sqrt{17} + 3 ), meaning the circle is smaller and might not intersect all tangent lines.For example, take ( b = 0 ). Then, the radius is ( |0 + 3| = 3 ). The circle is centered at ( (4, -1) ) with radius 3. The distance between centers is ( sqrt{17} approx 4.123 ). Since the radius is 3, which is less than ( sqrt{17} ), the circle does not reach the origin's circle. Therefore, there might be some tangent lines that don't intersect the given circle.Hence, the condition ( |b + 3| geq sqrt{17} + 3 ) is necessary.Therefore, the solution is ( b leq -sqrt{17} - 6 ) or ( b geq sqrt{17} ).**Final Answer**The values of ( b ) are all real numbers less than or equal to ( -sqrt{17} - 6 ) and greater than or equal to ( sqrt{17} ). Thus, the solution is (boxed{(-infty, -sqrt{17} - 6] cup [sqrt{17}, infty)})."},{"question":"The graph of the function y=x^{2} (- frac {1}{2}leqslant xleqslant frac {1}{2}) has a point P.

There's a point P on this graph, and we need to find the range of the inclination angle of the tangent line at point P. The options are given as A, B, C, D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.First, I remember that the inclination angle of a line is the angle it makes with the positive direction of the x-axis, measured counterclockwise. This angle is usually denoted by Œ± and it ranges from 0 to œÄ (0 ‚â§ Œ± < œÄ). The slope of the line, which is the tangent of this angle, is given by the derivative of the function at that point.So, for the function y = x¬≤, the derivative dy/dx is 2x. This derivative gives the slope of the tangent line at any point x on the curve. Since x is between -1/2 and 1/2, let's compute the range of the slope.If x is -1/2, the slope is 2*(-1/2) = -1. If x is 1/2, the slope is 2*(1/2) = 1. So, the slope of the tangent line, which is 2x, ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, the slope k is in the interval [-1, 1].Now, the slope k is equal to tan(Œ±). So, tan(Œ±) is between -1 and 1. I need to find the range of Œ± such that tan(Œ±) is between -1 and 1, considering that Œ± is between 0 and œÄ.Let me recall the values of tan(Œ±) for different angles. I know that tan(œÄ/4) = 1 and tan(3œÄ/4) = -1. So, when tan(Œ±) = 1, Œ± is œÄ/4, and when tan(Œ±) = -1, Œ± is 3œÄ/4.But wait, since Œ± is measured from 0 to œÄ, and tan(Œ±) is positive in the first quadrant (0 to œÄ/2) and negative in the second quadrant (œÄ/2 to œÄ). So, tan(Œ±) is positive when Œ± is between 0 and œÄ/2, and negative when Œ± is between œÄ/2 and œÄ.Given that tan(Œ±) is between -1 and 1, let's break this down:1. When tan(Œ±) is between 0 and 1, Œ± is between 0 and œÄ/4.2. When tan(Œ±) is between -1 and 0, Œ± is between 3œÄ/4 and œÄ.Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If tan(Œ±) is positive, then Œ± is in the first quadrant, so from 0 to œÄ/2. But since tan(Œ±) is 1 at œÄ/4, so for tan(Œ±) between 0 and 1, Œ± is between 0 and œÄ/4. Similarly, for tan(Œ±) between -1 and 0, Œ± is between 3œÄ/4 and œÄ because tan(3œÄ/4) is -1.But hold on, isn't tan(Œ±) negative in the second quadrant? So, when tan(Œ±) is negative, Œ± is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. But specifically, tan(Œ±) = -1 at Œ± = 3œÄ/4, and as Œ± approaches œÄ from below, tan(Œ±) approaches 0 from the negative side. So, when tan(Œ±) is between -1 and 0, Œ± is between 3œÄ/4 and œÄ.So, putting it all together, the range of Œ± is from 0 to œÄ/4 and from 3œÄ/4 to œÄ. So, the inclination angle Œ± is in [0, œÄ/4] ‚à™ [3œÄ/4, œÄ). Hmm, that seems to match option A.But let me double-check. Is there any chance that the angle could be between œÄ/4 and 3œÄ/4? Because sometimes when dealing with slopes, people might confuse the angle with the angle of elevation or something else.Wait, no. The inclination angle is always measured from the positive x-axis, so when the slope is positive, it's between 0 and œÄ/2, and when the slope is negative, it's between œÄ/2 and œÄ. So, the maximum positive slope is 1, which is at œÄ/4, and the minimum slope is -1, which is at 3œÄ/4.Therefore, the angles where the slope is between -1 and 1 are from 0 to œÄ/4 and from 3œÄ/4 to œÄ. So, the range is [0, œÄ/4] ‚à™ [3œÄ/4, œÄ). That's exactly option A.Just to make sure, let's visualize the graph of y = x¬≤ between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2. The curve is a parabola opening upwards, symmetric about the y-axis. The tangent lines at the endpoints x = -1/2 and x = 1/2 will have slopes of -1 and 1, respectively. As we move from the left endpoint to the right endpoint, the slope of the tangent line increases from -1 to 1.So, the steepest tangent lines are at the endpoints with slopes -1 and 1, corresponding to angles of 3œÄ/4 and œÄ/4. Between these points, the slope varies smoothly from -1 to 1, so the angles vary from 3œÄ/4 down to œÄ/4 as we move from left to right.Wait, actually, as x increases from -1/2 to 1/2, the slope increases from -1 to 1. So, the angle Œ± starts at 3œÄ/4 when x = -1/2, decreases to œÄ/2 as x approaches 0 (but wait, at x=0, the slope is 0, so the angle is 0? Wait, no. At x=0, the tangent line is horizontal, so the angle is 0. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.Hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.At x = -1/2, the slope is -1, so the angle is 3œÄ/4. As x increases towards 0, the slope increases from -1 to 0. So, the angle Œ± decreases from 3œÄ/4 to 0. Then, as x increases from 0 to 1/2, the slope increases from 0 to 1, so the angle Œ± increases from 0 to œÄ/4.Wait, that makes more sense. So, when x is negative, moving from -1/2 to 0, the slope goes from -1 to 0, so the angle goes from 3œÄ/4 to 0. Then, when x is positive, moving from 0 to 1/2, the slope goes from 0 to 1, so the angle goes from 0 to œÄ/4.Therefore, the range of Œ± is from 0 to œÄ/4 and from 3œÄ/4 to œÄ. But wait, when x is negative, the angle is between 3œÄ/4 and œÄ, but as x approaches 0 from the negative side, the angle approaches 0. So, actually, the angle Œ± is in [0, œÄ/4] when x is positive, and in [3œÄ/4, œÄ) when x is negative.But hold on, when x is negative, the slope is negative, so the angle is in the second quadrant, which is between œÄ/2 and œÄ. But specifically, since the slope is between -1 and 0, the angle is between 3œÄ/4 and œÄ. Similarly, when x is positive, the slope is between 0 and 1, so the angle is between 0 and œÄ/4.Therefore, combining both cases, the range of Œ± is [0, œÄ/4] ‚à™ [3œÄ/4, œÄ). So, that's option A.I think that makes sense. So, the correct answer should be A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Erin is watching a TV mini series of Pride and Prejudice.

Calculate the area of this triangle, in square units. Express your answer in simplest radical form.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a right triangle with angles of 45¬∞, 45¬∞, and 90¬∞. It says that there's an altitude from one of the acute angles to the hypotenuse, and that altitude measures 4 units. I need to find the area of this triangle and express it in simplest radical form.Hmm, first, since it's a 45-45-90 triangle, I remember that the sides are in the ratio 1:1:‚àö2. That means the two legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is ‚àö2 times longer than each leg. Let me denote the legs as 'a' and the hypotenuse as 'a‚àö2'.Now, the problem mentions an altitude from one of the acute angles to the hypotenuse. In a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse has a special property. I think it relates to the geometric mean or something like that. Let me recall... Oh, right! In a right triangle, the length of the altitude (h) to the hypotenuse is equal to the product of the legs divided by the hypotenuse. So, h = (a * a) / (a‚àö2) = a¬≤ / (a‚àö2) = a / ‚àö2.Wait, so if the altitude is 4 units, then 4 = a / ‚àö2. To find 'a', I can rearrange that: a = 4 * ‚àö2. That makes sense because multiplying both sides by ‚àö2 gives a = 4‚àö2.Now that I have the length of each leg, which is 4‚àö2 units, I can find the area of the triangle. The area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2. In this case, the base and height are both 'a', so the area is (4‚àö2 * 4‚àö2) / 2.Let me calculate that: 4‚àö2 * 4‚àö2 = 16 * 2 = 32. Then, dividing by 2 gives 16. So, the area is 16 square units.Wait a second, that doesn't seem right. Earlier, I thought the legs were 4 units each, but now I'm getting 4‚àö2 for the legs. Maybe I confused the altitude with one of the legs. Let me double-check.The altitude to the hypotenuse is 4 units. Using the formula h = a¬≤ / (a‚àö2) = a / ‚àö2, so h = 4 = a / ‚àö2, which gives a = 4‚àö2. So, the legs are 4‚àö2 each, and the hypotenuse is (4‚àö2) * ‚àö2 = 8 units.Then, the area should be (4‚àö2 * 4‚àö2) / 2 = (32) / 2 = 16. Hmm, but I'm getting 16, but I thought earlier it might be 8. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the area in terms of the altitude. The area can also be expressed as (hypotenuse * altitude) / 2. If the hypotenuse is 8 units and the altitude is 4 units, then the area is (8 * 4) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16. So, that confirms it.Wait, but I'm still confused because I thought in a 45-45-90 triangle, if the legs are 'a', the hypotenuse is a‚àö2, and the altitude to the hypotenuse is a / ‚àö2. So, if the altitude is 4, then a = 4‚àö2, and the area is (4‚àö2)^2 / 2 = (32) / 2 = 16.Yes, that seems consistent. So, the area is 16 square units. But earlier, I thought maybe it was 8. I must have mixed up the formulas. Let me just verify once more.If the legs are 4‚àö2 each, then the hypotenuse is 4‚àö2 * ‚àö2 = 8. The altitude to the hypotenuse is 4, so area is (8 * 4) / 2 = 16. Alternatively, using the legs, area is (4‚àö2 * 4‚àö2) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16. Both methods give the same result, so I think 16 is correct.Wait, but the initial problem says \\"from one of the acute angles to the hypotenuse\\". In a 45-45-90 triangle, both acute angles are 45¬∞, so the altitude from either would be the same. So, yes, the altitude is 4 units, leading to legs of 4‚àö2, hypotenuse of 8, and area of 16.I think I'm confident now that the area is 16 square units."},{"question":"In the equation frac{1}{j} + frac{1}{k} = frac{1}{4}, where both j and k are positive integers, find the sum of all possible values for k.","answer":"To solve the equation (frac{1}{j} + frac{1}{k} = frac{1}{4}) where both (j) and (k) are positive integers, we can follow these steps:1. **Multiply both sides by (4jk)** to eliminate the denominators:   [   4k + 4j = jk   ]   2. **Rearrange the equation** to bring all terms to one side:   [   jk - 4j - 4k = 0   ]   3. **Add 16 to both sides** to facilitate factoring:   [   jk - 4j - 4k + 16 = 16   ]   4. **Factor the left-hand side**:   [   (j - 4)(k - 4) = 16   ]   5. **Identify the positive integer pairs** of factors of 16:   [   (1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4), (8, 2), (16, 1)   ]   6. **Determine the corresponding values of (j) and (k)** by adding 4 to each factor:   - For ((1, 16)): (j = 5), (k = 20)   - For ((2, 8)): (j = 6), (k = 12)   - For ((4, 4)): (j = 8), (k = 8)   - For ((8, 2)): (j = 12), (k = 6)   - For ((16, 1)): (j = 20), (k = 5)   7. **Sum all possible values of (k)**:   [   20 + 12 + 8 + 6 + 5 = 51   ]"},{"question":"Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework.

How will ( S ) change if every term in an even position (i.e., ( b_2, b_4, ldots, b_{3000} )) is increased by 2 times?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a geometric progression. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, the problem says we have a geometric progression ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{3000} ) with all positive terms and a total sum ( S ). It also mentions that if every term with an index that's a multiple of 3 (like ( b_3, b_6, ldots, b_{3000} )) is increased by 50 times, the sum ( S ) increases by 10 times. Then, we need to figure out how ( S ) changes if every term in an even position (like ( b_2, b_4, ldots, b_{3000} )) is increased by 2 times.Okay, let's start by recalling what a geometric progression is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, denoted by ( q ). So, ( b_2 = b_1 q ), ( b_3 = b_1 q^2 ), and so on, up to ( b_{3000} = b_1 q^{2999} ).The sum ( S ) of the first ( n ) terms of a geometric progression is given by:[S = b_1 frac{1 - q^n}{1 - q}]In this case, ( n = 3000 ), so:[S = b_1 frac{1 - q^{3000}}{1 - q}]Now, the problem states that if we increase every third term by 50 times, the sum becomes 10 times the original sum. Let's denote the original sum as ( S ). When we increase the terms ( b_3, b_6, ldots, b_{3000} ) by 50 times, the new sum becomes ( S + 49(b_3 + b_6 + ldots + b_{3000}) ). This is because each of those terms is increased by 49 times their original value (since 50 times is 49 more than the original).So, the new sum is ( 10S ), which gives us:[S + 49(b_3 + b_6 + ldots + b_{3000}) = 10S]Subtracting ( S ) from both sides:[49(b_3 + b_6 + ldots + b_{3000}) = 9S]Let me denote the sum of the terms ( b_3, b_6, ldots, b_{3000} ) as ( S_3 ). So, ( S_3 = b_3 + b_6 + ldots + b_{3000} ).Since ( b_3, b_6, ldots, b_{3000} ) is also a geometric progression, with the first term ( b_3 = b_1 q^2 ) and common ratio ( q^3 ). The number of terms in this subsequence is ( 1000 ) because ( 3000 / 3 = 1000 ).Therefore, the sum ( S_3 ) is:[S_3 = b_1 q^2 frac{1 - (q^3)^{1000}}{1 - q^3} = b_1 q^2 frac{1 - q^{3000}}{1 - q^3}]Substituting back into the equation:[49 S_3 = 9S][49 left( b_1 q^2 frac{1 - q^{3000}}{1 - q^3} right) = 9 left( b_1 frac{1 - q^{3000}}{1 - q} right)]We can cancel out ( b_1 ) and ( 1 - q^{3000} ) from both sides:[49 frac{q^2}{1 - q^3} = 9 frac{1}{1 - q}]Note that ( 1 - q^3 = (1 - q)(1 + q + q^2) ), so substituting that in:[49 frac{q^2}{(1 - q)(1 + q + q^2)} = 9 frac{1}{1 - q}]We can cancel out ( 1 - q ) from both sides (assuming ( q neq 1 ), which it isn't because it's a geometric progression with positive terms and sum ( S )):[49 frac{q^2}{1 + q + q^2} = 9]Multiplying both sides by ( 1 + q + q^2 ):[49 q^2 = 9(1 + q + q^2)]Expanding the right side:[49 q^2 = 9 + 9q + 9q^2]Bringing all terms to one side:[49 q^2 - 9 q^2 - 9 q - 9 = 0]Simplifying:[40 q^2 - 9 q - 9 = 0]Now, we have a quadratic equation in terms of ( q ). Let's solve for ( q ) using the quadratic formula:[q = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]Where ( a = 40 ), ( b = -9 ), and ( c = -9 ):[q = frac{9 pm sqrt{81 + 1440}}{80} = frac{9 pm sqrt{1521}}{80} = frac{9 pm 39}{80}]So, we have two solutions:[q = frac{9 + 39}{80} = frac{48}{80} = frac{3}{5}]and[q = frac{9 - 39}{80} = frac{-30}{80} = -frac{3}{8}]Since all terms are positive, ( q ) must be positive. Therefore, ( q = frac{3}{5} ).Okay, so now we know the common ratio ( q = frac{3}{5} ). The next part of the problem asks how ( S ) changes if every term in an even position is increased by 2 times. That is, we double the terms ( b_2, b_4, ldots, b_{3000} ).Let's denote the sum of these even-indexed terms as ( S_2 ). So, ( S_2 = b_2 + b_4 + ldots + b_{3000} ).Similar to before, ( S_2 ) is a geometric progression with the first term ( b_2 = b_1 q ) and common ratio ( q^2 ). The number of terms here is ( 1500 ) because ( 3000 / 2 = 1500 ).Thus, the sum ( S_2 ) is:[S_2 = b_1 q frac{1 - (q^2)^{1500}}{1 - q^2} = b_1 q frac{1 - q^{3000}}{1 - q^2}]When we double these terms, the new sum becomes ( S + S_2 ). So, the new sum is:[S + S_2 = S + b_1 q frac{1 - q^{3000}}{1 - q^2}]We can express this in terms of ( S ). Recall that:[S = b_1 frac{1 - q^{3000}}{1 - q}]So, let's express ( S_2 ) in terms of ( S ):[S_2 = b_1 q frac{1 - q^{3000}}{1 - q^2} = b_1 frac{q (1 - q^{3000})}{(1 - q)(1 + q)} = frac{q}{1 + q} S]Therefore, the new sum is:[S + S_2 = S + frac{q}{1 + q} S = S left(1 + frac{q}{1 + q}right) = S left(frac{1 + q + q}{1 + q}right) = S left(frac{1 + 2q}{1 + q}right)]Substituting ( q = frac{3}{5} ):[frac{1 + 2 times frac{3}{5}}{1 + frac{3}{5}} = frac{1 + frac{6}{5}}{frac{8}{5}} = frac{frac{11}{5}}{frac{8}{5}} = frac{11}{8}]So, the new sum is ( frac{11}{8} S ), meaning the sum increases by a factor of ( frac{11}{8} ).Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the quadratic equation, solving for ( q ), getting ( frac{3}{5} ). Then, calculating ( S_2 ) correctly as a geometric series with first term ( b_1 q ) and ratio ( q^2 ). Then, expressing ( S_2 ) in terms of ( S ) by factoring out ( b_1 ) and using the sum formula. Then, adding ( S_2 ) to ( S ) and simplifying the expression. It seems correct.So, the final answer is that the sum ( S ) increases by ( frac{11}{8} ) times.**Final Answer**The sum ( S ) will increase by a factor of boxed{dfrac{11}{8}}."},{"question":"Let ( x ) be a non-zero real number such that ( x + frac{1}{x} ) is an integer. Show that for any ( n in mathbb{N} ), ( x^{n} + frac{1}{x^{n}} ) is also an integer.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a non-zero real number ( x ) such that ( x + frac{1}{x} ) is an integer. I need to show that for any natural number ( n ), ( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ) is also an integer. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that ( x + frac{1}{x} ) is an integer. Let's denote this integer as ( k ). So, ( k = x + frac{1}{x} ). My goal is to show that ( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ) is an integer for all ( n in mathbb{N} ).Maybe I can use mathematical induction here. Induction is often useful for proving statements that are supposed to hold for all natural numbers. So, let me recall how induction works. I need to prove the base case, usually for ( n = 1 ), and then assume it's true for some ( n ) and prove it for ( n + 1 ).Wait, but in this case, the base case is already given because ( x + frac{1}{x} ) is an integer. So, for ( n = 1 ), it's true. What about ( n = 2 )? Let me compute ( x^2 + frac{1}{x^2} ) and see if it's an integer.I remember that ( (x + frac{1}{x})^2 = x^2 + 2 + frac{1}{x^2} ). So, rearranging, ( x^2 + frac{1}{x^2} = (x + frac{1}{x})^2 - 2 ). Since ( x + frac{1}{x} ) is an integer ( k ), then ( k^2 - 2 ) is also an integer. Therefore, ( x^2 + frac{1}{x^2} ) is an integer. Okay, so for ( n = 2 ), it's also true.Now, maybe I can use induction for higher ( n ). Let's suppose that for some ( n geq 1 ), both ( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ) and ( x^{n+1} + frac{1}{x^{n+1}} ) are integers. Then, I need to show that ( x^{n+2} + frac{1}{x^{n+2}} ) is also an integer.Hmm, how can I relate ( x^{n+2} + frac{1}{x^{n+2}} ) to the previous terms? Maybe by multiplying ( x^{n+1} + frac{1}{x^{n+1}} ) by ( x + frac{1}{x} ). Let's try that:( left( x^{n+1} + frac{1}{x^{n+1}} right) left( x + frac{1}{x} right) = x^{n+2} + x^n + frac{1}{x^n} + frac{1}{x^{n+2}} ).So, that simplifies to ( x^{n+2} + frac{1}{x^{n+2}} + x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ). Therefore, if I subtract ( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ) from both sides, I get:( x^{n+2} + frac{1}{x^{n+2}} = left( x^{n+1} + frac{1}{x^{n+1}} right) left( x + frac{1}{x} right) - left( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} right) ).Since both ( x^{n+1} + frac{1}{x^{n+1}} ) and ( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ) are integers by the induction hypothesis, and ( x + frac{1}{x} ) is an integer, the right-hand side is the product of integers minus another integer, which is still an integer. Therefore, ( x^{n+2} + frac{1}{x^{n+2}} ) is an integer.Wait, but in induction, usually, we assume it's true for ( n ) and prove for ( n + 1 ). Here, I assumed it's true for both ( n ) and ( n + 1 ) to prove for ( n + 2 ). Is that a problem? Maybe I need to adjust my induction step.Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different approach. I remember that expressions like ( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ) can be related to Chebyshev polynomials or recurrence relations. Maybe I can find a recurrence relation for ( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ).Let me denote ( a_n = x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ). Then, from the earlier computation, I saw that ( a_{n+1} = a_n cdot a_1 - a_{n-1} ). Wait, let me verify that.Compute ( a_{n+1} = x^{n+1} + frac{1}{x^{n+1}} ).Multiply ( a_n ) by ( a_1 ):( a_n cdot a_1 = left( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} right) left( x + frac{1}{x} right) = x^{n+1} + x^{n-1} + frac{1}{x^{n-1}} + frac{1}{x^{n+1}} ).So, ( a_n cdot a_1 = a_{n+1} + a_{n-1} ). Therefore, rearranging, we get:( a_{n+1} = a_n cdot a_1 - a_{n-1} ).Yes, that's correct. So, this gives a recurrence relation where each term can be expressed in terms of the two previous terms. Since ( a_0 = 2 ) and ( a_1 = k ) (which is an integer), and assuming ( a_n ) and ( a_{n-1} ) are integers, then ( a_{n+1} ) is also an integer because it's a linear combination of integers with integer coefficients.Therefore, by induction, all ( a_n ) are integers.Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. I have ( a_0 = 2 ), which is an integer. ( a_1 = k ), given as an integer. Then, assuming ( a_{n-1} ) and ( a_n ) are integers, ( a_{n+1} = a_n cdot a_1 - a_{n-1} ) is also an integer. So, by induction, all ( a_n ) are integers.Yes, that seems solid. So, this recurrence relation approach works because each term is built from the previous two, which are integers, and the operations preserve integrality.Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the properties of ( x ). Since ( x + frac{1}{x} = k ), we can consider ( x ) as a root of the quadratic equation ( t^2 - kt + 1 = 0 ). The roots of this equation are ( x ) and ( frac{1}{x} ). Then, the sequence ( a_n = x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ) satisfies a linear recurrence relation based on the characteristic equation of the quadratic.Indeed, the recurrence relation ( a_{n+1} = k a_n - a_{n-1} ) is exactly the one we derived earlier. This is a second-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients, and since the initial terms ( a_0 ) and ( a_1 ) are integers, all subsequent terms will be integers as well.I think this covers the proof. By establishing the recurrence relation and using induction, we've shown that each ( x^n + frac{1}{x^n} ) is an integer for all natural numbers ( n ).**Final Answer**boxed{x^{n} + frac{1}{x^{n}} text{ is an integer for all } n in mathbb{N}}"},{"question":"How many diagonals does a regular nine-sided polygon contain?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of line segments that can be formed by connecting any two vertices of a nine-sided polygon.

Find the price per plant for types A and B respectively.2. If a total of 31 plants of types A and B are purchased, and the number of type B plants is less than twice the number of type A plants, design the most cost-effective plan and calculate the cost of that plan.","answer":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a community that bought two types of flowers, A and B, in two separate purchases. In the first purchase, they bought 30 plants of type A and 15 plants of type B for a total of 675 yuan. In the second purchase, they bought 12 plants of type A and 5 plants of type B for a total of 265 yuan. The prices of types A and B are the same in both purchases. First, I need to find the price per plant for types A and B. Let's denote the price of type A as ( x ) yuan per plant and the price of type B as ( y ) yuan per plant. From the first purchase, we can write the equation:[ 30x + 15y = 675 ]From the second purchase, we have:[ 12x + 5y = 265 ]Now, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be straightforward here.Let me try to eliminate one of the variables. If I multiply the second equation by 3, I'll have:[ 36x + 15y = 795 ]Now, I can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate ( y ):[ (36x + 15y) - (30x + 15y) = 795 - 675 ][ 6x = 120 ][ x = 20 ]So, the price per plant for type A is 20 yuan. Now, I can substitute ( x = 20 ) back into one of the original equations to find ( y ). Let's use the second equation:[ 12(20) + 5y = 265 ][ 240 + 5y = 265 ][ 5y = 25 ][ y = 5 ]Therefore, the price per plant for type B is 5 yuan.Now, moving on to the second part of the problem. The community wants to purchase a total of 31 plants of types A and B, with the condition that the number of type B plants is less than twice the number of type A plants. I need to design the most cost-effective plan and calculate its cost.Let me denote the number of type A plants as ( m ) and the number of type B plants as ( n ). We know that:[ m + n = 31 ]And the condition:[ n < 2m ]From the first equation, we can express ( n ) as:[ n = 31 - m ]Substituting this into the inequality:[ 31 - m < 2m ][ 31 < 3m ][ m > frac{31}{3} ][ m > 10.333... ]Since ( m ) must be an integer (you can't buy a fraction of a plant), the smallest possible value for ( m ) is 11. Therefore, ( m ) can be 11, 12, ..., up to 31, but we also need to ensure that ( n ) remains positive. So, ( m ) can be from 11 to 30.Now, the total cost ( W ) is given by:[ W = 20m + 5n ]Substituting ( n = 31 - m ):[ W = 20m + 5(31 - m) ][ W = 20m + 155 - 5m ][ W = 15m + 155 ]To minimize the cost, we need to minimize ( W ). Since ( W ) increases as ( m ) increases (because the coefficient of ( m ) is positive), the minimum cost occurs at the smallest possible value of ( m ), which is 11.So, substituting ( m = 11 ):[ W = 15(11) + 155 ][ W = 165 + 155 ][ W = 320 ]Therefore, the most cost-effective plan is to buy 11 type A plants and 20 type B plants, costing a total of 320 yuan.I think that's all. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, solving for ( x ) and ( y ):- From the first purchase: ( 30x + 15y = 675 )- From the second purchase: ( 12x + 5y = 265 )- Multiplying the second equation by 3: ( 36x + 15y = 795 )- Subtracting the first equation: ( 6x = 120 ) so ( x = 20 )- Substituting back: ( 12(20) + 5y = 265 ) leads to ( y = 5 )- That seems correct.For the second part:- Total plants: ( m + n = 31 )- Condition: ( n < 2m ) which simplifies to ( m > 10.333 ), so ( m = 11 )- Cost equation: ( W = 15m + 155 )- Minimum at ( m = 11 ): ( W = 320 )- That also seems correct.I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work. Hopefully, this makes sense!"},{"question":"If the pattern in the diagram continues, what fraction of the ninth triangle would be shaded?

The question is asking me what fraction of the ninth triangle would be shaded if the pattern continues. The problem gives me some specific information: the number of shaded triangles follows an arithmetic progression starting from 1, and the total number of small triangles in each diagram increases in a geometric progression with a ratio of 4. The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.First, let me try to understand what an arithmetic progression is. From what I remember, an arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. In this case, the number of shaded triangles starts at 1 and increases by a constant difference each time. The problem doesn't specify what the common difference is, but since it's an arithmetic progression starting from 1, I can assume that each time, the number of shaded triangles increases by a fixed number.Next, the total number of small triangles in each diagram increases in a geometric progression with a ratio of 4. A geometric progression is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. Here, the common ratio is 4, so each subsequent diagram has four times as many small triangles as the previous one.Let me try to break this down step by step.1. **Understanding the Arithmetic Progression for Shaded Triangles:**   - The first diagram has 1 shaded triangle.   - Since it's an arithmetic progression, the number of shaded triangles increases by a constant amount each time. But the problem doesn't specify the common difference. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I can figure it out from the context or the answer choices.2. **Understanding the Geometric Progression for Total Triangles:**   - The first diagram has 1 small triangle.   - Each subsequent diagram has 4 times as many small triangles as the previous one. So, the number of triangles in each diagram is: 1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096, 16384, 65536 for the first through ninth diagrams respectively.3. **Calculating the Number of Shaded Triangles:**   - If the number of shaded triangles is an arithmetic progression starting at 1, I need to determine the common difference. Since the answer choices include fractions like 1/16, 17/65536, 1/1024, and 1/16384, it seems like the number of shaded triangles might not be increasing too rapidly. Maybe the common difference is 2? Let me test that.   - If the common difference is 2, the sequence of shaded triangles would be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 for the first through ninth diagrams.4. **Calculating the Fraction for the Ninth Diagram:**   - The ninth diagram has 65536 small triangles in total.   - If the number of shaded triangles in the ninth diagram is 17, then the fraction shaded would be 17/65536.5. **Checking the Answer Choices:**   - Option B is 17/65536, which matches my calculation.6. **Verifying the Common Difference:**   - I assumed the common difference was 2 because it's a simple arithmetic progression and the answer matched one of the choices. If the common difference were different, say 1, the number of shaded triangles would be 9 in the ninth diagram, leading to a fraction of 9/65536, which isn't one of the options. Similarly, a common difference of 3 would give 1 + 8*3 = 25, which also isn't an option. So, 2 seems to be the correct common difference.7. **Double-Checking the Geometric Progression:**   - The total number of triangles in the ninth diagram is indeed 4^(9-1) = 4^8 = 65536. That's correct.8. **Conclusion:**   - The fraction of the ninth triangle that is shaded is 17/65536, which corresponds to option B."},{"question":"Given that vector overrightarrow{n}=(2,0,1) is a normal vector of plane Œ±, and point A(-1,2,1) is within Œ±, find the distance from point P(1,2,-2) to plane Œ±. The distance is (   ).A: frac{sqrt{5}}{5}B: sqrt{5}C: 2sqrt{5}D: frac{sqrt{5}}{10}","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the distance from point P(1,2,-2) to the plane Œ±. I know that the normal vector of the plane is given as n = (2,0,1), and there's a point A(-1,2,1) that lies on the plane. Hmm, let me recall how to find the distance from a point to a plane.First, I think the formula involves the normal vector and a point on the plane. I remember that the distance can be found using the dot product. Maybe it's something like the absolute value of the dot product of the vector from a point on the plane to the point P and the normal vector, divided by the magnitude of the normal vector. Let me write that down.So, if I have a point A on the plane and another point P, the vector AP is P - A. Then, the distance d is |AP ¬∑ n| divided by |n|. That sounds right. Let me compute AP first.Point A is (-1,2,1) and point P is (1,2,-2). So, AP = P - A = (1 - (-1), 2 - 2, -2 - 1) = (2, 0, -3). Okay, so AP is (2,0,-3).Next, I need to compute the dot product of AP and n. The normal vector n is (2,0,1). So, AP ¬∑ n = (2)(2) + (0)(0) + (-3)(1) = 4 + 0 - 3 = 1. Got that, the dot product is 1.Now, I need the magnitude of the normal vector n. The magnitude |n| is sqrt(2^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(4 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(5). So, |n| is sqrt(5).Putting it all together, the distance d is |AP ¬∑ n| / |n| = |1| / sqrt(5) = 1/sqrt(5). Hmm, but usually, we rationalize the denominator, right? So, 1/sqrt(5) is equal to sqrt(5)/5. That makes sense.Let me double-check my steps. I found vector AP correctly by subtracting coordinates of A from P. Then, I computed the dot product with n, which gave me 1. The magnitude of n is sqrt(5). Dividing 1 by sqrt(5) gives me 1/sqrt(5), which simplifies to sqrt(5)/5. Yeah, that seems correct.Wait, just to make sure, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by finding the equation of the plane first and then using the distance formula? Let me try that.The general equation of a plane is ax + by + cz + d = 0, where (a,b,c) is the normal vector. Here, the normal vector is (2,0,1), so the equation is 2x + 0y + 1z + d = 0, which simplifies to 2x + z + d = 0.Since point A(-1,2,1) lies on the plane, plugging its coordinates into the equation should satisfy it. So, 2*(-1) + 1 + d = 0. That's -2 + 1 + d = 0, which simplifies to -1 + d = 0, so d = 1. Therefore, the equation of the plane is 2x + z + 1 = 0.Now, using the distance formula from a point (x0,y0,z0) to the plane ax + by + cz + d = 0, which is |ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). Plugging in point P(1,2,-2):Distance = |2*1 + 0*2 + 1*(-2) + 1| / sqrt(2^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = |2 + 0 - 2 + 1| / sqrt(4 + 0 + 1) = |1| / sqrt(5) = 1/sqrt(5) = sqrt(5)/5.Okay, so both methods give me the same result. That makes me more confident that the distance is indeed sqrt(5)/5. Looking at the options, that's option A.I think I've got it right. The distance from point P to plane Œ± is sqrt(5)/5.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Emily just purchased 2 pairs of curtains for 30.00 each and 9 wall prints at 15.00 each.

Can it happen that this polyhedron is non-convex? (A polyhedron is inscribed in a sphere if all the vertices of its edges lie on the sphere.)","answer":"Alright, so I came across this interesting geometry problem: \\"A polyhedron is inscribed in a sphere. Can it happen that this polyhedron is non-convex?\\" At first glance, it seems a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down step by step.First, let's make sure I understand the terms correctly. A polyhedron is inscribed in a sphere if all its vertices lie on the surface of that sphere. That means every corner of the polyhedron touches the sphere. Now, a convex polyhedron is one where any line segment connecting two points inside the polyhedron lies entirely within it. If a polyhedron isn't convex, it means there's at least one line segment connecting two points inside it that goes outside the polyhedron. So, the question is asking if such a non-convex polyhedron can still have all its vertices on a sphere.I remember that regular polyhedrons, like the Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron), are all convex and can be inscribed in a sphere. But the question is about non-convex polyhedrons. I wonder if there are examples of non-convex polyhedrons that can still be inscribed in a sphere.Maybe I can start by thinking about modifying a convex polyhedron to make it non-convex while keeping all its vertices on the sphere. For example, take a convex polyhedron like a cube. If I somehow indent one of its faces, making it concave, would that still keep all the vertices on the sphere? Hmm, if I indent a face, the vertices of that face would still be on the sphere, but the new vertices created by the indentation might not lie on the sphere. That could be a problem.Wait, the problem says that all the vertices of its edges lie on the sphere. So, if I modify the polyhedron by adding new edges or vertices, those new vertices also need to lie on the sphere. That complicates things because it's not just about the original vertices; any new vertices introduced by the modification must also be on the sphere.Maybe instead of adding new vertices, I can rearrange the existing ones. Let's think about a simple example: a tetrahedron. It's convex and inscribed in a sphere. If I somehow \\"push\\" one of its vertices through the opposite face, would that make it non-convex? But then, that vertex would no longer lie on the sphere, right? Because it's now inside the sphere.Hmm, so pushing a vertex inside would take it off the sphere, which violates the condition. Maybe instead of pushing, I can somehow \\"flatten\\" a part of the polyhedron. For example, take an octahedron, which has eight triangular faces. If I remove one of its faces and replace it with a different shape, would that make it non-convex? But again, I have to ensure that all vertices remain on the sphere.Wait, maybe I can think of a different approach. There are non-convex polyhedrons called \\"star polyhedrons,\\" like the stellated octahedron. Are those inscribed in a sphere? I think they are, because all their vertices lie on a sphere. But I'm not entirely sure if they are considered inscribed in the traditional sense or if they have a different kind of relationship with the sphere.Let me check. A stellated octahedron, also known as the compound of two tetrahedrons, does have all its vertices on a sphere. So, in that case, it is inscribed in a sphere and is non-convex. That seems like a valid example. But I'm not sure if that's the only way or if there are simpler examples.Another thought: maybe take a convex polyhedron and \\"pinch\\" it in some way so that it becomes non-convex, but without moving any vertices off the sphere. For example, take a cube and indent one of its faces inward, but keep the vertices on the sphere. Is that possible? If I indent a face, the vertices of that face would still be on the sphere, but the new edges created by the indentation would have to connect to existing vertices. Wait, but if I indent a face, I'm effectively creating a new face, and the vertices of that new face would have to lie on the sphere as well. But since I'm only using existing vertices, maybe it's possible.Actually, if I take a cube and create a new face by connecting midpoints of edges, those midpoints wouldn't lie on the sphere unless the cube is scaled appropriately. But midpoints of edges of a cube inscribed in a sphere don't lie on the sphere unless the cube is scaled down, which would move the original vertices off the sphere. So, that doesn't work.Maybe instead of midpoints, I can use some other points on the sphere. But then, those points would have to be vertices of the polyhedron, which complicates things because I'm introducing new vertices that weren't there before.Wait, the problem says that all the vertices of its edges lie on the sphere. So, if I modify the polyhedron by adding new edges, the new vertices introduced by those edges must also lie on the sphere. That means I can't just add new vertices anywhere; they have to be on the sphere.So, perhaps I can take a convex polyhedron and rearrange its edges and faces in such a way that it becomes non-convex, but all the vertices remain on the sphere. For example, take an octahedron and rearrange some of its faces to create a non-convex shape.Let me try to visualize this. An octahedron has eight triangular faces, twelve edges, and six vertices. If I take two adjacent faces and \\"flip\\" them, would that make the polyhedron non-convex? I'm not sure. Maybe I need to remove some faces and add new ones in a way that creates a concave indentation.Alternatively, think about a polyhedron like a cube with a smaller cube carved out from one of its faces. If I do that, the resulting shape would be non-convex. But would all the vertices of the resulting polyhedron lie on a sphere? The original cube's vertices are on the sphere, but the vertices of the smaller cube might not be unless the smaller cube is scaled appropriately.Wait, if I carve out a smaller cube from the original cube, the vertices of the smaller cube would be inside the original sphere, so they wouldn't lie on the sphere. That violates the condition. So, that approach doesn't work.Maybe instead of carving out, I can create a non-convex shape by rearranging the faces without adding new vertices. For example, take a convex polyhedron and \\"twist\\" it in such a way that some faces become concave. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving vertices off the sphere.Another idea: consider a polyhedron with intersecting faces. For example, a star-shaped polyhedron like the stellated octahedron. As I thought earlier, it's non-convex and inscribed in a sphere. But I'm not sure if that's considered a standard inscribed polyhedron or if it's a special case.Wait, the definition says that a polyhedron is inscribed in a sphere if all the vertices of its edges lie on the sphere. So, as long as all the vertices are on the sphere, it doesn't matter if the polyhedron is convex or not. So, in the case of a stellated octahedron, all its vertices are on the sphere, so it is inscribed, even though it's non-convex.But is the stellated octahedron considered a valid example? I think it is, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there are simpler examples.Let me think of a different approach. Consider a polyhedron with a \\"dent\\" or a concave face. For example, take a convex polyhedron and push one of its faces inward, creating a concave indentation. If I do that, the vertices of the indentation would still be on the sphere, but the polyhedron would become non-convex.Wait, but pushing a face inward would require moving vertices, right? If I push a face inward, the vertices of that face would move closer to the center of the sphere, which would take them off the sphere. That violates the condition that all vertices must lie on the sphere.So, that approach doesn't work. Maybe instead of moving vertices, I can rearrange the edges and faces in a way that creates a non-convex shape without moving any vertices.For example, take a convex polyhedron and connect some of its vertices in a different way to create a non-convex shape. But I have to ensure that all the vertices remain on the sphere.Wait, if I connect vertices in a different way, I might create new edges and faces, but as long as all the vertices are still on the sphere, it should be fine. So, maybe it's possible to rearrange the edges and faces to create a non-convex polyhedron while keeping all vertices on the sphere.Let me try to think of a specific example. Take a cube, which is convex and inscribed in a sphere. Now, instead of connecting the vertices in the usual way to form squares, connect them in a different way to form a non-convex shape.For example, connect each vertex to its opposite vertex, creating a set of diagonals. But that would create a different polyhedron, maybe a star-shaped one, but I'm not sure if it's non-convex.Alternatively, connect vertices in a way that creates a concave face. For example, connect three vertices that form a triangle, but arrange them so that the triangle is concave. But wait, a triangle can't be concave; it's always convex. So, that doesn't work.Maybe connect four vertices to form a concave quadrilateral. A concave quadrilateral has one interior angle greater than 180 degrees. So, if I connect four vertices in such a way that one of the angles is greater than 180 degrees, that face would be concave, making the polyhedron non-convex.But can I do that while keeping all vertices on the sphere? Let's see. If I take four vertices of a cube and connect them in a way that creates a concave quadrilateral, the vertices would still be on the sphere, but the face would be concave. So, the resulting polyhedron would be non-convex.Wait, but does that actually work? If I connect four vertices of a cube in a different order, would that create a concave face? Let me visualize this. Take four vertices that form a square face of the cube. If I connect them in a different order, say, connecting each vertex to the next one with a step of two, I might create a different shape.Actually, connecting every other vertex of a cube's face would create a smaller square, but it would still be convex. Hmm, not helpful.Maybe connect three vertices to form a triangle and then connect the fourth vertex in a way that creates a concave shape. But as I thought earlier, a triangle can't be concave. So, maybe I need to connect more than four vertices to create a concave face.Alternatively, think about a polyhedron with a vertex that is \\"inside\\" the polyhedron, making it non-convex. But if all vertices are on the sphere, how can a vertex be inside the polyhedron? It would have to be inside the sphere, but the vertices are on the sphere, so that's not possible.Wait, no. A non-convex polyhedron can have vertices that are \\"inside\\" the convex hull of the polyhedron. But in this case, all vertices are on the sphere, so the convex hull would be the convex polyhedron inscribed in the sphere. If the polyhedron is non-convex, it would have to have some vertices that are inside the convex hull, but since all vertices are on the sphere, that can't happen.Wait, that seems contradictory. If all vertices are on the sphere, then the convex hull of the polyhedron is the convex polyhedron inscribed in the sphere. If the polyhedron is non-convex, it must have some vertices inside the convex hull, but those vertices are not on the sphere. So, how can a non-convex polyhedron have all its vertices on the sphere?This seems like a contradiction. If all vertices are on the sphere, then the convex hull is the convex polyhedron inscribed in the sphere. Any non-convex polyhedron would have to have some vertices inside the convex hull, but those vertices are not on the sphere. Therefore, it's impossible for a non-convex polyhedron to have all its vertices on the sphere.Wait, but earlier I thought of the stellated octahedron, which is non-convex and has all its vertices on the sphere. So, what's the deal with that?Maybe the stellated octahedron is a special case where the vertices are on the sphere, but the polyhedron is non-convex because it has intersecting faces or something like that. But in terms of vertices, they are still on the sphere.But according to the definition, a polyhedron is inscribed in a sphere if all the vertices of its edges lie on the sphere. So, as long as all the vertices are on the sphere, it doesn't matter if the polyhedron is convex or not. So, in that case, the stellated octahedron is a valid example of a non-convex polyhedron inscribed in a sphere.But then, why did I earlier think that a non-convex polyhedron would have vertices inside the convex hull, which are not on the sphere? Maybe because in some cases, non-convex polyhedrons have vertices inside the convex hull, but in the case of the stellated octahedron, all vertices are on the sphere, so they are not inside the convex hull.Wait, the convex hull of the stellated octahedron is still the convex polyhedron inscribed in the sphere, but the stellated octahedron itself is non-convex because it has intersecting faces or because it has a different structure.So, maybe it's possible to have a non-convex polyhedron inscribed in a sphere as long as all its vertices are on the sphere, even if it has intersecting faces or a different structure.But I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought that a non-convex polyhedron would have vertices inside the convex hull, which are not on the sphere, but in the case of the stellated octahedron, all vertices are on the sphere, so it's possible.Maybe the key is that in non-convex polyhedrons, the vertices can still be on the sphere, but the faces or edges are arranged in a way that makes the polyhedron non-convex.So, to answer the original question: Yes, it can happen that a polyhedron inscribed in a sphere is non-convex. An example is the stellated octahedron, which is non-convex but has all its vertices on a sphere.But I'm still not entirely sure if this is the only way or if there are simpler examples. Maybe I can think of another example.Consider a cube with a smaller cube attached to one of its faces, creating a non-convex shape. But in this case, the vertices of the smaller cube would not be on the sphere unless the smaller cube is scaled appropriately, which would move the original vertices off the sphere. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, take a convex polyhedron and \\"twist\\" it in such a way that some faces become concave, but all vertices remain on the sphere. I'm not sure how to visualize that, but maybe it's possible.Wait, another idea: consider a polyhedron with a vertex that is \\"inside\\" the polyhedron in terms of its structure, but still on the sphere. For example, think of a polyhedron where one vertex is connected to all other vertices in a way that creates a concave indentation, but the vertex itself is on the sphere.But I'm not sure if that's possible without moving the vertex off the sphere.Maybe the key is that non-convexity doesn't necessarily require vertices inside the convex hull; it can be achieved through the arrangement of faces and edges. So, as long as all vertices are on the sphere, the polyhedron can be non-convex.In conclusion, after thinking through various examples and considering the definition of inscribed polyhedrons, it seems that yes, a non-convex polyhedron can be inscribed in a sphere as long as all its vertices lie on the sphere. Examples like the stellated octahedron demonstrate this possibility."},{"question":"Find all functions  f:mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} , such that  f(a)f(a+b)-ab  is a perfect square for all  a, b in mathbb{N} . ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all functions ( f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} ) such that for every ( a, b in mathbb{N} ), the expression ( f(a)f(a+b) - ab ) is a perfect square. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's understand what the problem is asking. We have a function that takes natural numbers to natural numbers, and when we take the product of ( f(a) ) and ( f(a+b) ) and subtract ( ab ), the result should always be a perfect square. So, for any two natural numbers ( a ) and ( b ), this condition must hold.I think a good starting point is to consider specific values of ( a ) and ( b ) to see if I can deduce some properties of ( f ). Maybe setting ( a = 1 ) could simplify things.Let me set ( a = 1 ). Then the expression becomes ( f(1)f(1 + b) - 1 cdot b ). This must be a perfect square for all ( b in mathbb{N} ). So, ( f(1)f(b + 1) - b ) is a perfect square.Let me denote ( c = f(1) ). Then, ( c cdot f(b + 1) - b ) is a perfect square for all ( b ). Maybe I can analyze this for small values of ( b ).Let‚Äôs try ( b = 1 ). Then, ( c cdot f(2) - 1 ) must be a perfect square. Let's denote ( f(2) = d ). So, ( c cdot d - 1 ) is a perfect square.Similarly, for ( b = 2 ), we have ( c cdot f(3) - 2 ) is a perfect square. Let's denote ( f(3) = e ). So, ( c cdot e - 2 ) is a perfect square.I wonder if ( c ) can be 1. If ( c = 1 ), then ( f(b + 1) - b ) must be a perfect square for all ( b ). That seems restrictive. For example, when ( b = 1 ), ( f(2) - 1 ) is a perfect square. Let's say ( f(2) = 1 + k^2 ) for some ( k in mathbb{N} ). Similarly, for ( b = 2 ), ( f(3) - 2 ) is a perfect square, so ( f(3) = 2 + m^2 ).But if ( c = 1 ), then ( f(b + 1) = b + n^2 ) for some ( n ). This might not hold for all ( b ), especially as ( b ) grows, because ( f(b + 1) ) would have to grow quadratically, but ( f ) is just a function from ( mathbb{N} ) to ( mathbb{N} ). Maybe ( c ) isn't 1.What if ( c = 2 )? Then, ( 2f(b + 1) - b ) is a perfect square. Let's see for ( b = 1 ): ( 2f(2) - 1 ) is a perfect square. Let‚Äôs say ( 2f(2) - 1 = k^2 ). Then, ( f(2) = frac{k^2 + 1}{2} ). Since ( f(2) ) must be a natural number, ( k^2 + 1 ) must be even, so ( k ) must be odd. Let‚Äôs say ( k = 2m + 1 ), then ( k^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 ), so ( f(2) = frac{4m^2 + 4m + 2}{2} = 2m^2 + 2m + 1 ).Similarly, for ( b = 2 ): ( 2f(3) - 2 ) is a perfect square. So, ( 2f(3) - 2 = m^2 ), which implies ( f(3) = frac{m^2 + 2}{2} ). Again, ( m^2 + 2 ) must be even, so ( m ) must be even. Let‚Äôs say ( m = 2n ), then ( f(3) = frac{4n^2 + 2}{2} = 2n^2 + 1 ).This seems possible, but I don't see a clear pattern yet. Maybe trying ( c = 3 ) or another value could help, but this might not be the most efficient approach.Perhaps instead of fixing ( a = 1 ), I should consider varying ( a ) and ( b ) together. Let me think about setting ( b = 1 ) instead. Then, for any ( a ), the expression becomes ( f(a)f(a + 1) - a ) is a perfect square.So, ( f(a)f(a + 1) - a ) is a perfect square for all ( a ). This seems like a recursive relation. Maybe I can express ( f(a + 1) ) in terms of ( f(a) ).Let‚Äôs denote ( f(a)f(a + 1) = a + k_a^2 ), where ( k_a ) is some natural number. Then, ( f(a + 1) = frac{a + k_a^2}{f(a)} ). Since ( f(a + 1) ) must be a natural number, ( f(a) ) must divide ( a + k_a^2 ).This suggests that ( f(a) ) is a divisor of ( a + k_a^2 ). But without knowing more about ( f(a) ), it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can assume a form for ( f(a) ) and see if it fits.Suppose ( f(a) = a ). Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = a(a + b) - ab = a^2 + ab - ab = a^2 ), which is indeed a perfect square. So, ( f(a) = a ) is a solution.Is this the only solution? Let me check another simple function. Suppose ( f(a) = c cdot a ) for some constant ( c ). Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = c cdot a cdot c cdot (a + b) - ab = c^2 a(a + b) - ab ). For this to be a perfect square for all ( a, b ), it's not clear if such a ( c ) exists except for ( c = 1 ).Wait, if ( c = 1 ), as before, it works. What if ( c = 2 )? Then, ( 4a(a + b) - ab = 4a^2 + 4ab - ab = 4a^2 + 3ab ). Is this a perfect square for all ( a, b )? Let's test ( a = 1, b = 1 ): ( 4 + 3 = 7 ), which is not a perfect square. So, ( c = 2 ) doesn't work.What if ( f(a) ) is a constant function? Let‚Äôs say ( f(a) = k ) for all ( a ). Then, ( k cdot k - ab = k^2 - ab ) must be a perfect square for all ( a, b ). But ( k^2 - ab ) can be negative if ( ab > k^2 ), which is not allowed since we're dealing with natural numbers. So, constant functions don't work unless ( k ) is very large, but even then, for large ( a, b ), ( ab ) can exceed ( k^2 ), making the expression negative. So, constant functions are out.Another idea: Maybe ( f(a) = a + d ) for some constant ( d ). Let's test this. Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = (a + d)(a + b + d) - ab ). Expanding this: ( a(a + b + d) + d(a + b + d) - ab = a^2 + ab + ad + ad + bd + d^2 - ab = a^2 + 2ad + bd + d^2 ). Hmm, this simplifies to ( a^2 + 2ad + bd + d^2 ). Is this a perfect square?Let me see if this can be expressed as ( (a + m)^2 ) for some ( m ). Expanding ( (a + m)^2 = a^2 + 2am + m^2 ). Comparing to our expression: ( a^2 + 2ad + bd + d^2 ). So, we need ( 2am = 2ad + bd ) and ( m^2 = d^2 ). From ( m^2 = d^2 ), ( m = d ) or ( m = -d ), but since we're dealing with natural numbers, ( m = d ).Then, ( 2ad = 2ad + bd ) implies ( 0 = bd ), which is only possible if ( b = 0 ), but ( b ) is a natural number, so ( b geq 1 ). Contradiction. Therefore, ( f(a) = a + d ) doesn't work unless ( d = 0 ), which gives ( f(a) = a ), which we already know works.So far, ( f(a) = a ) is the only solution I can find. Maybe I should try to see if there are other possible forms or if ( f(a) = a ) is indeed the only solution.Let me consider another approach. Suppose ( f ) is multiplicative, meaning ( f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) ). Wait, no, multiplicative usually means ( f(ab) = f(a)f(b) ). Maybe additive? If ( f ) is additive, ( f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) ). Let me see if that helps.If ( f ) is additive, then ( f(a)f(a + b) = f(a)(f(a) + f(b)) = f(a)^2 + f(a)f(b) ). Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = f(a)^2 + f(a)f(b) - ab ). For this to be a perfect square for all ( a, b ), it's unclear. Maybe if ( f(a) = a ), which is additive, we get ( a^2 + ab - ab = a^2 ), which works. But if ( f ) is another additive function, say ( f(a) = ka ), then ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = k^2 a(a + b) - ab ). As before, unless ( k = 1 ), this doesn't seem to work.Alternatively, maybe ( f ) is linear, ( f(a) = ma + c ). Let's try that. Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = (ma + c)(m(a + b) + c) - ab ). Expanding this: ( m^2 a(a + b) + mc(a + b) + mc a + c^2 - ab ). Simplify: ( m^2 a^2 + m^2 ab + mc a + mc b + mc a + c^2 - ab ).Combine like terms: ( m^2 a^2 + (m^2 b + 2mc) a + mc b + c^2 - ab ). For this to be a perfect square for all ( a, b ), the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions. It's getting complicated, but maybe setting ( c = 0 ) simplifies things. Then, ( f(a) = ma ), and as before, ( m^2 a(a + b) - ab ). We saw that ( m = 1 ) works, but others don't.So, perhaps linear functions other than ( f(a) = a ) don't work. Maybe ( f ) is quadratic? Let's suppose ( f(a) = a^2 ). Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = a^2(a + b)^2 - ab ). This is ( a^2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - ab = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - ab ). Is this a perfect square? It doesn't look like it because the degrees are too high and the cross terms don't seem to form a square.Alternatively, maybe ( f(a) = sqrt{a} ), but since ( f ) maps naturals to naturals, ( sqrt{a} ) isn't necessarily natural unless ( a ) is a perfect square, which isn't guaranteed. So, that's out.Another thought: Maybe ( f(a) ) is related to ( a ) in a way that ( f(a)f(a + b) ) is close to ( ab ). Since ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab ) is a square, perhaps ( f(a)f(a + b) = ab + k^2 ) for some ( k ). But how can this hold for all ( a, b )?Wait, if ( f(a) = a ), then ( f(a)f(a + b) = a(a + b) = a^2 + ab ), and subtracting ( ab ) gives ( a^2 ), which is a square. So, that works. Is there another function where ( f(a)f(a + b) ) is ( ab + ) something squared?Maybe if ( f(a) = a + c ), but as I saw earlier, that doesn't seem to work unless ( c = 0 ).Alternatively, perhaps ( f(a) ) is a multiple of ( a ), but as I saw, only ( f(a) = a ) works.Let me try another angle. Suppose ( a = b ). Then, the expression becomes ( f(a)f(2a) - a^2 ) must be a perfect square. So, ( f(a)f(2a) = a^2 + k_a^2 ). Since ( f(a) ) and ( f(2a) ) are natural numbers, their product is ( a^2 + k_a^2 ). This suggests that ( f(a) ) divides ( a^2 + k_a^2 ). But without knowing ( k_a ), it's hard to say.If ( f(a) = a ), then ( f(2a) = 2a ), so ( f(a)f(2a) = 2a^2 ), and ( 2a^2 - a^2 = a^2 ), which is a square. So, that works.What if ( f(a) = 2a )? Then, ( f(a)f(2a) = 2a cdot 4a = 8a^2 ), and ( 8a^2 - a^2 = 7a^2 ), which is not a perfect square unless ( a = 0 ), which isn't in ( mathbb{N} ). So, ( f(a) = 2a ) doesn't work.Alternatively, suppose ( f(a) = a + 1 ). Then, ( f(a)f(2a) = (a + 1)(2a + 1) = 2a^2 + 3a + 1 ). Subtracting ( a^2 ) gives ( a^2 + 3a + 1 ). Is this a perfect square? Let's test ( a = 1 ): ( 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 ), not a square. ( a = 2 ): ( 4 + 6 + 1 = 11 ), not a square. So, no.Hmm, maybe ( f(a) ) has to be linear, but only ( f(a) = a ) works. Let me try to see if there are any other possibilities.Suppose ( f(a) = a ) for all ( a ). Then, as we saw, it works. Suppose there exists some ( a ) where ( f(a) neq a ). Let's say ( f(a) = a + d ) for some ( d neq 0 ). Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = (a + d)(a + b + d) - ab ). Expanding: ( a(a + b + d) + d(a + b + d) - ab = a^2 + ab + ad + ad + bd + d^2 - ab = a^2 + 2ad + bd + d^2 ).For this to be a perfect square, ( a^2 + 2ad + bd + d^2 ) must be a square. Let me see if this can be expressed as ( (a + m)^2 ). Expanding ( (a + m)^2 = a^2 + 2am + m^2 ). Comparing to our expression: ( a^2 + 2ad + bd + d^2 ). So, we need ( 2am = 2ad + bd ) and ( m^2 = d^2 ). From ( m^2 = d^2 ), ( m = d ) or ( m = -d ). Since we're dealing with natural numbers, ( m = d ).Then, ( 2ad = 2ad + bd ) implies ( 0 = bd ). But ( b ) is a natural number, so ( b geq 1 ), which implies ( d = 0 ). But ( d neq 0 ) by assumption. Contradiction. Therefore, ( f(a) ) cannot be ( a + d ) for ( d neq 0 ).So, it seems that if ( f(a) ) deviates from ( a ), it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, ( f(a) = a ) might be the only solution.Wait, but I should check if there are other functions, maybe non-linear, that could satisfy the condition. For example, could ( f(a) ) be something like ( a^k ) for some ( k )?Let‚Äôs try ( f(a) = a^2 ). Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = a^2(a + b)^2 - ab ). Expanding: ( a^2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - ab = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - ab ). Is this a perfect square? It doesn't look like it because the degrees are too high and the cross terms don't seem to form a square. For example, take ( a = 1, b = 1 ): ( 1 + 2 + 1 - 1 = 3 ), not a square. So, ( f(a) = a^2 ) doesn't work.What about ( f(a) = sqrt{a} )? But ( f ) maps naturals to naturals, so ( sqrt{a} ) isn't necessarily natural unless ( a ) is a perfect square, which isn't guaranteed. So, that's out.Another idea: Maybe ( f(a) ) is related to ( a ) in a way that ( f(a)f(a + b) ) is a square plus ( ab ). But I don't see how to construct such a function without it being ( a ).Wait, let me think about the original condition again: ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab ) is a perfect square for all ( a, b ). If I fix ( a ) and vary ( b ), perhaps I can find a relationship.Let‚Äôs fix ( a ) and let ( b ) vary. Then, ( f(a)f(a + b) = ab + k_{a,b}^2 ). Since ( f(a) ) is fixed for a given ( a ), ( f(a + b) = frac{ab + k_{a,b}^2}{f(a)} ). This suggests that ( f(a) ) divides ( ab + k_{a,b}^2 ) for all ( b ).But ( ab ) can be made arbitrarily large by choosing large ( b ), so ( f(a) ) must divide numbers of the form ( ab + k_{a,b}^2 ) for all ( b ). This seems restrictive unless ( f(a) ) is 1 or something related to ( a ).If ( f(a) = 1 ), then ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = 1 cdot f(a + b) - ab ). For this to be a perfect square, ( f(a + b) = ab + k_{a,b}^2 ). But ( f(a + b) ) must be a natural number, which it is, but this would mean ( f ) is defined in terms of ( a ) and ( b ), which isn't possible because ( f ) is a function of a single variable. So, ( f(a) = 1 ) doesn't work.Wait, actually, if ( f(a) = 1 ), then for each ( a ), ( f(a + b) = ab + k_{a,b}^2 ). But ( f(a + b) ) must be the same regardless of how we express ( a + b ). For example, ( f(2) ) can be expressed as ( f(1 + 1) = 1 cdot 1 + k_{1,1}^2 ). So, ( f(2) = 1 + k_{1,1}^2 ). Similarly, ( f(2) = f(2 + 0) ), but ( b ) must be at least 1, so maybe not. This seems too vague.Alternatively, if ( f(a) = a ), then ( f(a + b) = a + b ), and ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab = a(a + b) - ab = a^2 ), which is a square. So, that works.I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to see if I can prove that ( f(a) = a ) is the only solution.Suppose ( f ) is not equal to ( a ) for some ( a ). Then, there exists some ( a ) where ( f(a) neq a ). Let me consider the smallest such ( a ). Let‚Äôs say ( a = n ) is the smallest natural number where ( f(n) neq n ).Now, for ( a = n ), ( f(n)f(n + b) - n b ) must be a perfect square for all ( b ). Let‚Äôs set ( b = 1 ). Then, ( f(n)f(n + 1) - n ) is a perfect square. Since ( n ) is the smallest where ( f(n) neq n ), we know that ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k < n ). So, ( f(n + 1) ) must be such that ( f(n)f(n + 1) - n ) is a perfect square.But ( f(n + 1) ) could be ( n + 1 ) or something else. If ( f(n + 1) = n + 1 ), then ( f(n)(n + 1) - n ) must be a perfect square. Let‚Äôs denote ( f(n) = m ). Then, ( m(n + 1) - n = mn + m - n = (m - 1)n + m ). For this to be a perfect square, ( (m - 1)n + m ) must be a square.But since ( n ) is the smallest where ( f(n) neq n ), ( f(n) = m neq n ). Let's see if ( m ) can be greater or less than ( n ).If ( m > n ), then ( (m - 1)n + m = mn - n + m = n(m - 1) + m ). Since ( m > n ), this is greater than ( n(n - 1) + n = n^2 ). So, it's greater than ( n^2 ). Is it a perfect square? It could be ( (n + k)^2 ) for some ( k geq 1 ). Let's see:( (n + k)^2 = n^2 + 2kn + k^2 ). Comparing to ( mn - n + m ), we have:( mn - n + m = n(m - 1) + m = n(m - 1) + m ).If ( m = n + 1 ), then ( n(n) + (n + 1) = n^2 + n + 1 ). Is this a perfect square? Let's check for small ( n ):If ( n = 1 ), ( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ), not a square.If ( n = 2 ), ( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 ), not a square.If ( n = 3 ), ( 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 ), not a square.So, ( m = n + 1 ) doesn't work.What if ( m = n + 2 )? Then, ( n(n + 1) + (n + 2) = n^2 + n + n + 2 = n^2 + 2n + 2 ). Is this a square? For ( n = 1 ): 1 + 2 + 2 = 5, not a square. ( n = 2 ): 4 + 4 + 2 = 10, not a square. ( n = 3 ): 9 + 6 + 2 = 17, not a square. Doesn't seem to work.Alternatively, maybe ( m < n ). Let‚Äôs say ( m = n - 1 ). Then, ( (n - 1 - 1)n + (n - 1) = (n - 2)n + n - 1 = n^2 - 2n + n - 1 = n^2 - n - 1 ). Is this a perfect square? For ( n = 2 ): 4 - 2 - 1 = 1, which is a square. For ( n = 3 ): 9 - 3 - 1 = 5, not a square. So, only works for ( n = 2 ).But if ( n = 2 ), then ( f(2) = 1 ). Let me check if this leads to a contradiction.If ( f(2) = 1 ), then for ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 1 ), ( f(2)f(3) - 2 cdot 1 = 1 cdot f(3) - 2 ) must be a perfect square. So, ( f(3) - 2 ) is a perfect square. Let‚Äôs denote ( f(3) = k^2 + 2 ).Similarly, for ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 2 ), ( f(1)f(3) - 1 cdot 2 = f(1)f(3) - 2 ) must be a perfect square. If ( f(1) = 1 ) (since ( n = 2 ) is the smallest where ( f(n) neq n )), then ( 1 cdot f(3) - 2 = f(3) - 2 = k^2 ). So, ( f(3) = k^2 + 2 ).But from ( a = 2, b = 1 ), ( f(3) = k^2 + 2 ). So, consistent.Now, let's check ( a = 3, b = 1 ): ( f(3)f(4) - 3 cdot 1 = (k^2 + 2)f(4) - 3 ) must be a perfect square. Let‚Äôs denote ( f(4) = m ). So, ( (k^2 + 2)m - 3 ) is a perfect square.But ( f(4) ) must be a natural number. Let me see if I can find ( m ) such that ( (k^2 + 2)m - 3 ) is a square. Let‚Äôs say ( (k^2 + 2)m = t^2 + 3 ). Since ( k^2 + 2 ) is at least 2 (since ( k geq 1 )), ( m ) must be such that ( t^2 + 3 ) is divisible by ( k^2 + 2 ).This seems complicated, but maybe for ( k = 1 ), ( f(3) = 1 + 2 = 3 ). Then, ( (1 + 2)m - 3 = 3m - 3 = 3(m - 1) ) must be a perfect square. So, ( 3(m - 1) ) is a square. Therefore, ( m - 1 ) must be a multiple of 3, say ( m - 1 = 3n^2 ), so ( m = 3n^2 + 1 ). Then, ( f(4) = 3n^2 + 1 ).But then, for ( a = 4, b = 1 ): ( f(4)f(5) - 4 ) must be a perfect square. Let‚Äôs denote ( f(5) = p ). So, ( (3n^2 + 1)p - 4 ) is a perfect square. This is getting too recursive and I don't see a clear pattern.Alternatively, maybe ( f(3) ) can't be too large. If ( f(3) = 3 ), then ( f(3) - 2 = 1 ), which is a square. So, ( f(3) = 3 ). Then, ( (k^2 + 2)m - 3 = 3m - 3 = 3(m - 1) ) must be a square. So, ( m - 1 ) must be a multiple of 3, say ( m = 3n^2 + 1 ). Then, ( f(4) = 3n^2 + 1 ).But if ( f(4) = 3n^2 + 1 ), then for ( a = 4, b = 1 ): ( f(4)f(5) - 4 = (3n^2 + 1)f(5) - 4 ) must be a square. Let‚Äôs denote ( f(5) = q ). So, ( (3n^2 + 1)q - 4 ) is a square. This seems too open-ended.I think this approach isn't leading me anywhere. Maybe I should consider that ( f(a) = a ) is the only solution because any deviation leads to contradictions or complexities that can't be resolved.Another angle: Let's consider the function ( f ) being injective or surjective. If ( f ) is injective, then ( f(a) neq f(b) ) for ( a neq b ). But I don't know if ( f ) is injective.Alternatively, maybe ( f ) is multiplicative or additive, but as I saw earlier, only ( f(a) = a ) seems to fit.Wait, let me think about the case when ( a = b ). Then, ( f(a)f(2a) - a^2 ) is a perfect square. If ( f(a) = a ), then ( a cdot 2a - a^2 = 2a^2 - a^2 = a^2 ), which is a square. If ( f(a) neq a ), say ( f(a) = ka ), then ( ka cdot k(2a) - a^2 = 2k^2 a^2 - a^2 = (2k^2 - 1)a^2 ). For this to be a perfect square, ( 2k^2 - 1 ) must be a perfect square. Let‚Äôs denote ( 2k^2 - 1 = m^2 ). This is a Pell-type equation: ( m^2 - 2k^2 = -1 ). The minimal solution is ( m = 1, k = 1 ). The next solution is ( m = 7, k = 5 ), but then ( f(a) = 5a ). Let me check if this works for ( a = 1, b = 1 ): ( f(1)f(2) - 1 = 5 cdot 10 - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49 = 7^2 ). Okay, that works. For ( a = 1, b = 2 ): ( f(1)f(3) - 2 = 5 cdot 15 - 2 = 75 - 2 = 73 ), which is not a perfect square. So, ( f(a) = 5a ) doesn't work. Therefore, even though ( f(a) = ka ) satisfies the ( a = b ) case for some ( k ), it fails for other ( a, b ).So, the only solution from the Pell equation that works is ( k = 1 ), which gives ( f(a) = a ).Another thought: Maybe ( f(a) = a ) for all ( a ) is the only solution because any other function would fail for some ( a, b ). Since I can't find any other function that satisfies the condition without leading to contradictions, I think ( f(a) = a ) is the only solution.To summarize, after trying various forms of ( f(a) ) and checking specific cases, the only function that satisfies ( f(a)f(a + b) - ab ) being a perfect square for all ( a, b in mathbb{N} ) is ( f(a) = a )."},{"question":"The minimum value of the function f(x)=sin xcos x-cos ^{2}x+ frac {1}{2} in the interval [0, frac {œÄ}{2}] is (quadquad).A: (-1)B: (-frac {1}{2})C: (1)D: (0)","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = sin x cos x - cos¬≤x + 1/2, and I need to find its minimum value in the interval [0, œÄ/2]. Hmm, let's see. I remember that sometimes trigonometric functions can be simplified using identities, so maybe I can rewrite this in a way that's easier to work with.First, I notice that sin x cos x is part of the double angle identity for sine. The identity is sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x, so that means sin x cos x is equal to (1/2) sin(2x). Let me write that down:f(x) = (1/2) sin(2x) - cos¬≤x + 1/2.Now, looking at the cos¬≤x term, I recall another identity: cos¬≤x = (1 + cos(2x))/2. Let me substitute that in:f(x) = (1/2) sin(2x) - (1 + cos(2x))/2 + 1/2.Simplify that:f(x) = (1/2) sin(2x) - 1/2 - (1/2) cos(2x) + 1/2.Wait, the -1/2 and +1/2 cancel each other out. So now I have:f(x) = (1/2) sin(2x) - (1/2) cos(2x).Hmm, that looks simpler. Maybe I can factor out the 1/2:f(x) = (1/2)(sin(2x) - cos(2x)).Now, I remember that expressions like a sin Œ∏ + b cos Œ∏ can be written as a single sine function with a phase shift. The formula is a sin Œ∏ + b cos Œ∏ = ‚àö(a¬≤ + b¬≤) sin(Œ∏ + œÜ), where œÜ is the phase shift. In this case, I have sin(2x) - cos(2x), so a = 1 and b = -1.Let me compute the amplitude:‚àö(1¬≤ + (-1)¬≤) = ‚àö(1 + 1) = ‚àö2.So, sin(2x) - cos(2x) can be written as ‚àö2 sin(2x - œÄ/4). Let me verify that:Using the identity sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B.So, ‚àö2 sin(2x - œÄ/4) = ‚àö2 [sin(2x) cos(œÄ/4) - cos(2x) sin(œÄ/4)].Since cos(œÄ/4) = sin(œÄ/4) = ‚àö2/2, this becomes:‚àö2 [sin(2x)(‚àö2/2) - cos(2x)(‚àö2/2)] = ‚àö2*(‚àö2/2)(sin(2x) - cos(2x)) = (2/2)(sin(2x) - cos(2x)) = sin(2x) - cos(2x).Yes, that works. So, f(x) = (1/2)(‚àö2 sin(2x - œÄ/4)) = (‚àö2/2) sin(2x - œÄ/4).Simplify ‚àö2/2: that's equal to 1/‚àö2, but maybe it's better to keep it as ‚àö2/2 for now.So, f(x) = (‚àö2/2) sin(2x - œÄ/4).Now, to find the minimum value of f(x) in the interval [0, œÄ/2], I need to find the range of the argument of the sine function, which is 2x - œÄ/4.When x is in [0, œÄ/2], then 2x is in [0, œÄ], so 2x - œÄ/4 is in [-œÄ/4, 3œÄ/4].So, the argument of the sine function varies from -œÄ/4 to 3œÄ/4.I know that the sine function reaches its minimum at -œÄ/2, but in this interval, the lowest point is at -œÄ/4, which is the left endpoint.Wait, let me think again. The sine function has a period of 2œÄ, and in the interval [-œÄ/4, 3œÄ/4], it starts at sin(-œÄ/4) = -‚àö2/2, goes up to sin(œÄ/2) = 1 at œÄ/2, and then decreases to sin(3œÄ/4) = ‚àö2/2.So, the minimum value of sin(Œ∏) in this interval is at Œ∏ = -œÄ/4, which is -‚àö2/2.Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is (‚àö2/2)*(-‚àö2/2) = (‚àö2 * -‚àö2)/(2*2) = (-2)/4 = -1/2.So, the minimum value of f(x) is -1/2.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I used the double angle identity correctly: sin x cos x = (1/2) sin(2x).2. I substituted cos¬≤x with (1 + cos(2x))/2 correctly.3. Simplified the expression, and the constants canceled out.4. Factored out 1/2 and recognized the form a sin Œ∏ + b cos Œ∏.5. Calculated the amplitude correctly as ‚àö2.6. Found the correct phase shift, resulting in sin(2x - œÄ/4).7. Determined the interval for 2x - œÄ/4 as x goes from 0 to œÄ/2.8. Identified the minimum value of sine in that interval as -‚àö2/2.9. Multiplied by ‚àö2/2 to get the minimum value of f(x) as -1/2.Everything seems to check out. So, I'm confident that the minimum value is -1/2.**Final Answer**boxed{-dfrac{1}{2}}"},{"question":"Suppose 12^6 equiv m pmod{8}, where 0 le m < 8.What is the value of m?","answer":"First, I need to find the value of (12^6 mod 8).

Let me try to work through it step by step.The equation is:[frac{sin(pi - theta) + cos(theta - 2pi)}{sin theta + cos(pi + theta)} = frac{1}{2}]Hmm, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that can help simplify expressions like these. Let me recall them.First, for the numerator:1. (sin(pi - theta)): I think this is equal to (sin theta). Wait, no, isn't it (sin theta)? Let me confirm. Yes, because sine is positive in the second quadrant, and (sin(pi - theta) = sin theta).2. (cos(theta - 2pi)): Cosine has a period of (2pi), so (cos(theta - 2pi) = cos theta). That simplifies nicely.So the numerator becomes:[sin theta + cos theta]Now, the denominator:1. (sin theta): That's just (sin theta).2. (cos(pi + theta)): I remember that cosine of an angle plus pi is equal to negative cosine of that angle. So, (cos(pi + theta) = -cos theta).So the denominator becomes:[sin theta - cos theta]Putting it all together, the equation simplifies to:[frac{sin theta + cos theta}{sin theta - cos theta} = frac{1}{2}]Alright, now I have a simpler equation. Let me denote this as:[frac{sin theta + cos theta}{sin theta - cos theta} = frac{1}{2}]I need to solve for (tan theta). Maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction. Let's try that.Cross-multiplying gives:[2(sin theta + cos theta) = 1(sin theta - cos theta)]Expanding both sides:Left side: (2sin theta + 2cos theta)Right side: (sin theta - cos theta)So now, the equation is:[2sin theta + 2cos theta = sin theta - cos theta]Let me bring all terms to one side to solve for (sin theta) and (cos theta). Subtract (sin theta) and add (cos theta) to both sides:Left side: (2sin theta + 2cos theta - sin theta + cos theta)Right side: 0Simplify left side:( (2sin theta - sin theta) + (2cos theta + cos theta) = sin theta + 3cos theta )So, the equation becomes:[sin theta + 3cos theta = 0]Hmm, so (sin theta = -3cos theta). To find (tan theta), which is (frac{sin theta}{cos theta}), let me divide both sides by (cos theta):[frac{sin theta}{cos theta} = -3]Therefore, (tan theta = -3).Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Simplified (sin(pi - theta)) to (sin theta).2. Simplified (cos(theta - 2pi)) to (cos theta).3. Simplified (cos(pi + theta)) to (-cos theta).4. Cross-multiplied correctly: (2(sin theta + cos theta) = sin theta - cos theta).5. Expanded and simplified correctly to get (sin theta + 3cos theta = 0).6.

The options are A, B, C, and D. Let me go through each one step by step.Starting with option A: \\"For all ( x in mathbb{N}^{*} ), ( (x - 2)^2 > 0 ).\\" Hmm, ( mathbb{N}^{*} ) usually denotes the set of positive integers, right? So ( x ) can be 1, 2, 3, and so on. Let me plug in some values to test this. If ( x = 1 ), then ( (1 - 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 ), which is greater than 0. If ( x = 2 ), then ( (2 - 2)^2 = 0^2 = 0 ), which is not greater than 0. So, wait, when ( x = 2 ), the expression equals zero, which means the statement isn't true for all positive integers. So option A seems to be false. But let me check the other options just to be sure.Moving on to option B: \\"There exists ( x_0 in mathbb{R} ) such that ( tan{x_0} = 2 ).\\" Okay, tangent is a trigonometric function, and I know that the tangent function has a range of all real numbers. That means for any real number ( y ), there exists an ( x ) such that ( tan{x} = y ). So, since 2 is a real number, there must be some ( x_0 ) where ( tan{x_0} = 2 ). For example, ( x_0 = arctan{2} ) would satisfy this. So option B is true.Next is option C: \\"There exists ( x_0 in mathbb{R} ) such that ( log_{2}{x_0} < 2 ).\\" Let's think about logarithms. The logarithm function ( log_{2}{x} ) is defined for ( x > 0 ). If I choose ( x_0 = 1 ), then ( log_{2}{1} = 0 ), which is certainly less than 2. Alternatively, if I pick ( x_0 = 2 ), ( log_{2}{2} = 1 ), which is also less than 2. So, yes, there are plenty of real numbers ( x_0 ) that satisfy this condition. Therefore, option C is true.Finally, option D: \\"For all ( x in mathbb{R} ), ( 3^{x - 2} > 0 ).\\" Exponential functions with positive bases are always positive, regardless of the exponent. Since 3 is a positive number, raising it to any real power ( x - 2 ) will result in a positive number. So, no matter what ( x ) is, ( 3^{x - 2} ) will always be greater than 0. Hence, option D is true.Wait, so going back to option A, since when ( x = 2 ), ( (x - 2)^2 = 0 ), which is not greater than 0, the statement \\"For all ( x in mathbb{N}^{*} ), ( (x - 2)^2 > 0 )\\" is false. That means option A is the false proposition here.Just to double-check, let me recap:- A: False because when ( x = 2 ), the expression equals 0.- B: True because tangent can take any real value.- C: True because logarithm can be less than 2 for certain inputs.- D: True because exponentials are always positive.Yep, that seems consistent.

Find a_{3} and a_{37}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to rearrange the numbers from 1 to 37 into a sequence. The sequence has to start with 37 and then 1. Also, for each position k from 1 to 36, the sum of the first k numbers should be divisible by the (k+1)th number. I need to find the third number in the sequence and the last number, which is the 37th number.First, let me understand the problem step by step. I have to create a sequence a1, a2, ..., a37 where a1 is 37 and a2 is 1. Then, for each k from 1 to 36, the sum of the first k terms should be divisible by the (k+1)th term. That means:- For k=1: a1 is divisible by a2- For k=2: a1 + a2 is divisible by a3- For k=3: a1 + a2 + a3 is divisible by a4- And so on, until k=36: a1 + a2 + ... + a36 is divisible by a37Given that a1 is 37 and a2 is 1, let's start by checking the first condition. For k=1, the sum is just a1, which is 37. This sum needs to be divisible by a2, which is 1. Well, 37 divided by 1 is 37, which is an integer, so that condition is satisfied.Next, for k=2, the sum is a1 + a2, which is 37 + 1 = 38. This sum needs to be divisible by a3. So, a3 must be a divisor of 38. The divisors of 38 are 1, 2, 19, and 38. But since we're rearranging numbers from 1 to 37, 38 is out of the question. Also, 1 is already used as a2, so the possible candidates for a3 are 2 and 19.Now, let's think about the rest of the sequence. We need to make sure that each subsequent term divides the cumulative sum up to that point. It might be helpful to consider the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 37. The sum S of the first n natural numbers is given by S = n(n+1)/2. So, for n=37, S = 37*38/2 = 703.This total sum is important because the last term a37 must divide this total sum. So, a37 must be a divisor of 703. Let's factorize 703 to find its divisors. 703 divided by 19 is 37, so 703 = 19*37. Therefore, the divisors of 703 are 1, 19, 37, and 703. Again, since we're only using numbers from 1 to 37, the possible candidates for a37 are 1, 19, and 37. But 1 is already used as a2, and 37 is used as a1, so the only remaining candidate is 19. Therefore, a37 must be 19.Now, going back to a3, we had two possible candidates: 2 and 19. Since 19 is already going to be the last term, a37, we can't use 19 again because all numbers must be distinct. Therefore, a3 must be 2.So, summarizing:- a1 = 37- a2 = 1- a3 = 2- a37 = 19I should double-check if this makes sense. After a3, the sum up to k=3 is 37 + 1 + 2 = 40. This sum needs to be divisible by a4. So, a4 must be a divisor of 40. The divisors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40. Again, considering our range and the numbers already used (37, 1, 2), the possible candidates are 4, 5, 8, 10, 20. We can choose any of these, but since the problem only asks for a3 and a37, we don't need to determine the entire sequence.However, it's good to ensure that the logic holds. If a3 is 2, then the sum up to k=3 is 40, which is divisible by a4. If a4 is, say, 4, then the next sum would be 40 + 4 = 44, which needs to be divisible by a5. 44's divisors are 1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44. Excluding the already used numbers, possible a5 could be 11 or 22. This seems feasible.Continuing this way, each term would need to divide the cumulative sum, which is manageable as long as we choose appropriate divisors each time. The key points were identifying that a37 must be 19 because it's the only available divisor of the total sum, and then a3 must be 2 since 19 is reserved for the end.I think this makes sense. I don't see any immediate contradictions or issues with this approach. So, I'm confident that a3 is 2 and a37 is 19."},{"question":"Randomly select a number x from the interval [-2,4], find the probability that x satisfies |x| leqslant 1.","answer":"First, I need to understand the interval from which the number ( x ) is being selected.
